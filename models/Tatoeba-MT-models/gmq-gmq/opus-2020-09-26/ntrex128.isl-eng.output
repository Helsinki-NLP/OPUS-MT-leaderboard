Good stewards are concerned about “looking like fools ”
Uggur is in some managers because of the proposal to change their title to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Senate of Plants).
Anxieties are caused by a plan to change the name of the Council to the Danish Congress.
Housekeepers from all sides are worried that this may make them laugh.
One worker member said that his group was worried because “twp and Pwp are struggling. ”
For readers who live outside Wales: in the elephant, twp means mad, and pwp means defilement.
A steward of Plaid Cymru said that the whole group was “unhappy ” and made other suggestions.
A minister of the Danish Conservative said that his group had “open mind ” about the name change, but pointed out that there was no great difference between the word MWP and Muppet.
In this context, it can be stated that the slanted w is similar to the u in Icelandic.
The Council, now working on a legal basis to make the name changes, said: “The definitive determination of all the names of the members of the Council will, of course, lie with the members themselves. ”
The Wales Government Act 2017 empowered the Danish Council to change its name.
In June, the Council published public opinion surveys that showed great support for calling the Council for the Danish Council.
With regard to the title of the stewards, the WMP (Welsh Parliament members, well-known MEPs) was selected, but the MWP received the most support from the public in the polls.
According to news, managers are now making other suggestions, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the President of the Council, Elin Jones, who is to submit a proposal for the changes within a few weeks.
The draft reform will also include other changes in the functioning of the Council, including rules on the exclusion of the stewards and the organisation of the committee system.
Ministers will be able to pay the final vote on their title at the start of the discussion of the draft.
Macedonians vote in the elections for the country’s name change
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their name to “the Republic of North Macedonia. ”
This issue was voted in an attempt to solve decades of conflict with the neighbouring Greece, who has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens city has long argued that the name of its neighbours in the north corresponds to the requirements of its territory and has repeatedly objected to their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gerge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said that he will not consider the elections valid.
However, supporters of the votes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the price that needs to be paid in order to join the EU and NATO.
The church clocks of St. Martin sound when churches in Harlem have problems
“ The older people I have spoken to said that before before, bars and churches were found on every street corner, ” said Mr. Adams.
“Today neither is there. ”
He said it was understandable that bars would decrease.
“ People have other ways to meet, ” he said today.
“Bars are no longer the centers of the neighborhood where people gather regularly. ”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money that comes from the sale of possessions will not last as long as leaders expect “and sooner or later they will be back in the field of origin. ”
He added, then, that possible churches would be replaced by houses full of people who will not help save the remaining refugees.
“ The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will become white, ” he said, “and will therefore hurry for these churches to be permanently closed, because it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches. ”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church a decade later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the original white Methodist congregation moved away.
A congregation of blacks who had served in the neighborhood took over the building.
The Black Congregation took over the Saint Martin’s Church under the guidance of Father John Howard Johnson, who took the initiative to avoid merchants on 125th Street, the main Harlem shopping street, who was keen to hire black workers or to give them an increase in their position.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but the members of Father Johnson’s congregation made plans to rebuild it, and they also had the clock game constructed.
Father David Johnson, a son and successor of Father Johnson, called the watch game proud “the clocks of the poor. ”
The expert who played the clock game in July called it a different name: “Children’s Treasury ” and“ a unique historic instrument. ”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also stated that this was the first clock game in the world that a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played, moved over to a larger clock game in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't get anyone else in his place.
Over the past few months, many architects and entrepreneurs have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by the leaders of the church, and others from the Bishop.
In July, the Church Council, which supervises the application and is appointed as church leaders, wrote to the bishop’s district, expressing its concern that the Bishop “will endeavour to bring the cost over to the church council, even though it had not been involved in the recruitment of the architects and the entrepreneurs sent by the Bishop.
Some attendant complained of the lack of transparency from the Bishop.
A Shark hurts a 13 - year - old boy who dived for a humming in California
According to the authorities, a 13 - year - old shark attacked a boy and wounded him on Saturday when the boy was diving for a lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before seven o’clock in the morning near Beacon’s Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then rushing over along with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that it was just anxious to get a bump, but then “he realized that the boy cried out,“ I was bitten!
I was bit!"
All his bracelet was torn up," said Hammel of what he saw when he came to the boy.
“ I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, “There is a shark in the water! ” added Hail.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously wounded.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
At a press conference, the head of the Coast Guard, Larry Giles, said that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous type of sharks.
Giles added that the victim had suffered serious damage to the upper body.
The authorities shut down sea access from the Ponto Beach coast in Casablad to the Swami’s coast in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and safety purposes.
Giles said that more than 135 different species of sharks are in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s with a plan to rehabilitate in Britain's cottage market
Sainsbury’s intends to compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with cottage products in a commercial centre style and with specially educated assistants.
This is part of the plan to enter the UK Cotton Market, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is increasing as the market in fashion and home products is decreasing.
An investment in cleaning products is part of a marketed way to use a shelf space that was previously new to television, microwaves, and home supplies.
Sainsbury’s claims that it is intended to double its product selection for up to 3000 types of products, including trademarks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have increased space with marked areas similar to those found in shops such as Boots.
The shop will also resume the sale of Boutique products in order to ensure that the majority of the lips are road-friendly, but younger consumers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the parfym store Fragrance Shop will test a commodity position in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Internet trade and an increased tendency for consumers to buy a small amount of food every day in the neighborhood stores means that large markets need to work more to get people to come to them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury’s, said that the shops would look more and more like shopping centres when the merchants are trying to fight the low-commerce stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and other goods than food.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos camps in hundreds of shops and has also introduced to history the number of Habitat camps since the purchase of both chains two years ago, according to which it has increased sales and made purchases more profitable.
The first attempt by the store to relive their cleaning and medication departments was not successful.
Sainsbury’s tested collaboration with Boots around 2000, which ended because of a dispute on how to share the revenue of large-market medicinal products.
The new policy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, owner of Lloyd’s pharmaceutical stores, over 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these programmes by adding a wide range of luxury product products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have completely revolved the appearance of our laundry shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be in hand with advice.
Our product selection is designed to meet all needs. Fascinating environments and comfortable locations make us an exciting laundry store that transforms old trade habits."
Peter Jones “everlasting vow ” after Holly Willoughby cancels the 11 million pound agreement
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became “perpetrated ” after the TV sensor Holly Willoughby terminated a 11 million pounds contract with his company to focus on new agreements with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their livelihood and accompanying marks, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, the Gwyneth Paltrow trademark.
Willoughby, 37 years old, presents his decision on Instagram in the show This Morning.
Holly Willoughby has understood Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, left with the painful hood by dismissing participation in popular lifestyle companies in the last hour to focus on new and rewarding agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones has been “everlasting ” at a difficult Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the TV woman popularly admitted that she had not enough time for the home product and accompanying mark Truly because of the new contracts worth up to £1.5 million.
The company has been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s trademark, and was intended to double Willoughby’s possessions, with an estimated value of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced in Instagram that she was going to retire from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to stay in one of her many summer homes.
A source reported: “Truly was the first one on Holly’s priority list.
It was supposed to be her future project, which would make it profitable for the next two decades.
Her decision to quit came to an end.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line went to the market.
There's a full layer of lips in Marlow's headquarters that are ready to go to sale."
Experts believe that the removal of this “Morning ” of the United Kingdom’s most popular stars can cost the company millions because of large product investments, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home products, and may result in further delays in the sale of the product line.
This could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby founded Truly and Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as President of the Board of Directors in March.
The couple spend their summer vacations together, and Jones has a 40 - percent share in the Baldwin company, which produces television.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S trademark and will replace Ant McPartlin as the director of the I-TV programs I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to say anything about his business. ”
Difficult Discussion “And Then We Became Loved ”
He blasphemed with the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate to the President, and for being so positive to the leaders of North Korea.
Why has President Trump left so much?
Said Trump and simulated the voice of a reporter.
"I haven't left anything behind."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards nuclear decommissioning North Korea.
On the other hand, discussions about the decommissioning of nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the chief ambassador of North Korea, told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the north had not received “appropriate response ” from the United States at the first steps towards nuclear devastation.
Instead, he said that the United States continued to support business petitions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump was more positive in his speech.
“We come very closely together with North Korea, ” he said.
“ We were about to go to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He said his attempts to improve the relationship with Kim have resulted in positive results — missile tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the earthly remnant of American soldiers were returned home.
He also warned his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
“ It’s so easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a trough stadium, there were only 200 people standing there, ” Trump pointed out the crowd in front of him.
Flood waves and earthquakes in Indonesia cause great damage on the island, hundreds have died
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, an international aid organization was told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the inhabitants of Lombok had to flee their homes, an emergency was not declared, but this is the prerequisite for the international organizations to be able to engage in aid.
“ In many cases, unfortunately, they have made clear that they are not going to ask for assistance from international organizations, so this is difficult, ” said Miss Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children organization is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain when foreign aid workers can start work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman of the National Disaster Institute, said that Indonesian governments were evaluating the situation in Pala to see if international organizations should be allowed to assist in the relief work.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly unprepared to protect itself from natural forces.
Flood waves have been built in Aceh, which are rare at other coastlines.
Apparently, the lack of flood wave protection in Palu continued to increase death, even when warnings were issued.
Even in the best situation, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia may be a challenge.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A ship that has been deployed by the Lombok port to feed the victims of the earthquake is now on the way to Pala, but it will take at least three days to get to the new accident site.
President Widodo made it his election campaign to improve the depressed routes of Indonesia, and he has put a lot of money in his way and railroads.
However, the lack of finance has plagued Mr. Joko's control, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also faces persistent tension between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative religion.
More than 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes when Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with spoils, bows, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.

The police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside an apartment.
Today, people who thought they knew the woman have come to ask where she was found this morning.

The British Congress of Cromwell is the latest monument accused of “rewriting history ”
The prohibition of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of his violent puritanian companions of so many cultural and religious preciouss of England.
The Cromwell Company, however, said that Mr. Crick's suggestion was "the legs" and "the attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion about the removal of statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace was inevitable.
The opposition of the English civil war against cultural symbols was neither the order nor the execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for his forefather Thomas’ actions in the preceding century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, marks the seasonal spirit in the 19th century, and is part of the history of a man who many believe still deserve praise.
To The Sunday Telegraph, Mr. Goldsmith said: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps in the late 19th century rather than today, to be the guardian of the Congress against external pressure, in his case the kingdom.
The fact that this description is all true is still a matter of history.
However, the conflicts in the middle of the 17th century may have shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well - known person representing one side of their conflict.
It is worth the favor and remembrance of his accomplishments as the guardian of the kingdom."
Swine attacks a Chinese farmer and kills him.
Swine attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on the market in southwestern China, according to local reports.
The man named “Yuan ” was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood close to the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou, according to reports from South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines in pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
According to his uncle, he had traveled from the neighborhood of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead, and he saw that the door to the nearby porcine stairs was open.
He said that inside the barrel was a big shelter with a bloody mouth.
A trial confirmed that the 250 kg of the gut killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My uncle’s feet were bloody and wounded, ” said my uncle, with the surname “Wu, ” at the Guiyang Evening News.
A camera recording showed Yuan to come to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market said to Evening News that the pig was locked up so that it didn’t attack anyone else while the police were collecting evidence in the field.
According to news, Yuan’s family and market owners have discussions about remedy for his death.
There are cases that, although rare, pigs attacked people.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and seriously hurt the man.
Ten years earlier, a well - grown farmer clipped 300 kg of pigs at a tractor until his wife shook the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that blood tastes can raise aggression in them.
“ They're just playing.
They like to be curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them," he said.
The remnant of the hurricane of Rose brings heavy rainfall across the southwest of the United States
As prophesied, the strength of the hurricane of Rose will decrease as it crosses cooler seas on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will produce a great amount of rain that could result in floods in northern Mexico and southwestern America in the next few days.
Rosa became a class 1, with wind power up to 136 km/h, at 5 a.m. to the eastern coastal time on Sunday, and it was located over 600 km/h southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is estimated that Rosa will go north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific is built, and it will go east towards the west coast of the United States, so when Rosa arrives at the Baja California River on Monday as a tropical storm, it will follow a great tropical shore north into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rose will follow up to 25 cm of precipitation in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical swab will be mixed with the approaching lowness that will produce large and widespread rainfall over the southwestern part of the next few days.
Local rainfalls of 2.5 to 10 cm may cause dangerous rapid floods, soil movements, and potential passages in the desert.
A large tropical relapse will result in up to 5 to 10 cm of rainfall per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected in some places in the southwestern part, especially in most Arizona.
There is a potential for rapid flooding with a deteriorating situation because of the spread of tropical rains.
People are strongly advised to avoid walking into the wilderness when there is a risk of tropical rainfall.
High rainfall can turn giants into a lingering river, and thunderstorms result in storms and duststorms.
The approaching level will include local precipitation in certain areas at the coastline of South California.
There is a potential for more than 1 cm of precipitation, which could cause minor movement of soil and road hail.
This is the first rainfall in the region.
Some widespread tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rainfall spreads over a larger area late on Monday and Tuesday.
A great rainfall will spread out over four counties on Tuesday and lasts Wednesday.
As the Arctic region is cooling and the tropical region continues to be somewhat warm, it can be expected to change much in the October of the United States.
At times, this can cause high temperature fluctuations over short distances.
There was a very good example of high temperature differences in the United States on Sunday.
There is almost seven degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
The next few days, persistent summer breeds will try to rebuild and disperse.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern United States will start on October with a temperature of approximately 25 degrees or more from the plains in the south to the northeastern countries.
A temperature could rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long - term forecast indicates that there is a high risk of temperatures above the average for the eastern part of the United States in the first part of the month of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh interrogation
More than 20 million people watched the exciting witness of Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Judge, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual fraud that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980 ’ s.
At the same time, the political pattality continued, and television stations suspended a regular program to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, Arizona Senator, proposed that the FBI be able to investigate the accusations for one week.
Ford told the Senate Committee of Justice that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunken her and tried to clothe her at a school party.
Kavanaugh said in emotional evidence that he was confident that this had not happened.
More people likely watched the trial than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported had observed on Friday.
The company measured the average views on the TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not available immediately for other television channels showing the interrogations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen, too, usually finds it difficult to measure people’s views at offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar to the size of a football game or the Oscar Prize Festival.
According to Nielsen, most of the interrogations that took all day looked at the Fox News Channel, or 5.69 million, which have loyally supported the designation of Kavanaugh.
ABC was second place with 3.26 million observers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest remained great.
Flake was the center of the fairy tale on Friday.
After the office of this Senator of the Republic Party announced that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the photographer CNN and CBS reached pictures of the protestant screaming at him on Friday morning when he tried to enter an elevator to get to a meeting with the Justice Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while shortly raining over him in direct broadcast at CNN.
One woman said, “I'm standing right here in front of you. ”
“ Do you think he's telling the truth to the people of the country? ”
People said to him: “You have authority while so many women have no power. ”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and before the lift door closed, he said that he would express himself more in the committee meeting.
The cable and television stations had all direct broadcasts later when the Justice Committee decided whether Kavanaugh’s nomination should continue to be elected by the Senate.
Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the accusations against the appointment next week, but the smallest number of Democrats have encouraged it.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Chris Coons, Senator of Democrats.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and some other senators.
Flake’s vote was important because it was evident that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has authorized the FBI's investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
Britain’s Prime Minister, May, accuses critics of “being in a political game ” because of Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of her plan to leave the European Union to “be in a political game ” for the future of Britain and to undermine the interests of the country.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attends the Birmingham Conservation Conference of 29 September 2018.
In a second interview published next to her interview on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, said that the so - called Chequers programme on Brexit was “always absurd. ”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested one suspect for the death of Wayde Sims in a deadly shooting attack, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20 - year - old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for charges of second grade murder, according to Baton Rouge police.
The authorities published a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson and said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glasses in the scene and said they found genetics from Simpson on them, according to WAFB, CBS sister's association.
The police say Simpson confessed to the interrogation that he shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, there was a guarantee of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge County Corporate office published a preliminary report on Friday, which says that the cause of death is a gunshot in the head and down the neck.
The authorities wanted to thank the Louisiana Police Special Force, the police lab, the police at the Southern University University, and the civilians in the area for the assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, chairman of LSU sports, thanked the lawmen for “the eagerness and the desire for righteousness. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
In Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU, the high - grown two - yard prominence grew up.
He scored 5.6 points on average and took 2.6 relapses for each game during the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU’s basketball coach, Will Wade, said that the people were “sharmed ” and“ in shock ” because of the death of Wayde.
“ This is something you’re constantly worried about, ” said Wade.
A Vulcan Spreads Ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention advised the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the gig’s growth and recorded 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a period of 24 hours.
The center watched vibrating and trembling from the volcano.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ashes on car windows in the neighborhood of Mexico, such as in Xochimilco.
Earth’s physicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 on Richter crossed central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as “Don Goyo, ” has been active since 1994.
Police fighting Catalan apartheid just before the birthday of the Independence Charter
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent Protestants took up an uproar police, and thousands were involved in protests for the first birthday of the controversial elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked apartheids stoned an egg - insurrection police and threw a dust paint that produced a dark cloud of dust on the streets, usually filled with tourists.
Conflicts also broke out later the other day, and the police used bats to keep fights under control.
A group of separators cried out: “We will not forget and not forgive ” for a few hours while their opposers shouted: “Long live Spain. ”
Fourteen people needed care for minor injuries in the protests, according to the local media.
There is great tension in the independent area one year after the first October national vote was convicted illegally by the Madrid authorities, but the Catalan separators celebrated it.
The majority of voters chose independence, but participation was poor, since most opposers ignored the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop elections across the region, which resulted in conflict.
A group of independenceists had stayed out at night on Friday to prevent protests to support the police.
The antidote was conducted, but it was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electric engineer, participated in the protests of a separator with his wife and said that he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ In the past, we experienced some of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that the Catalonian independent groups have achieved the necessary but hard victory in the region's chaos last December, many of the most famous leaders are either in voluntary exile or in custody after the trial because of their role in the organisation of the vote and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who took the protests to the support of the police, said that the political forces of both states had encouraged the conflict.
“ The tension is increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison waiting for trial since late last year, announced that he would come to the European Council next year.
“My proposition in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in the field of democratic values and the oppression that we have seen the Spanish Government use, ” he said.

Enough scores in 1-0 winning Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first mark guaranteed the victory of Livingston
The body of Livingston, who came from the lower department, came open to Rangers, and Steven Gerrard had to endure another loss in 18 games as Ibrox’s manager.
Mark Dolly Menga made the luck and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has not yet been working in the elite department of this season and is playing against Hearts, who are eight points ahead of the top, the next Sunday.
Before that game, Rangers will meet Rapid Vienna in the European Division on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still unconquered in the division with six wins, and Coach Holt has not yet had to experience a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities for bitless guests
Holt's team should have been over long before it scored, but their bones caused Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson got through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot by after sliding through the defense to receive a bald transmission from Graig Halkett across the target.
The guest donors let Rangers play in front of them quietly, knowing that they could cause trouble in the right places.
And that is how the goal was challenged.
Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga together, who accepted a shipment and scored from the center of the water.
At that stage, Rangers had ruled the ball, but the local defense was indispensable, and Liam Kelly, a target guard, did not have to do much work.
Thus it continued into the second half - game, even though Alfredo Morelos was able to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was halted by the legs of Allan McGregor, Rangers' target, and Lithgow shot from a target after the attack from Livingston.
Questions were continually found in Livingston's suit, but they were kicked off, and two demands for a massion - after Halkett's defense against Glenn Middleton, and one afterwards - were dismissed.
“ Excellent ” by Livingston Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, reporter of BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Stadium
Excellent performance and final for Livingston.
For a normal man, they did a great job and continued to override all expectations on their way up.
Their styles and teams have hardly changed since they got back to the top department, but Holt deserves great praise for having cut the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the captain was extremely good and led a fully organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toes all the time.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they've been under Gerrard's control, they played far into expectations.
They failed to finish their quests and only once managed to open the round of locals, so this should be a wake-up for Rangers who are now sitting in the middle of the department.
Erdogan receives blended receptions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, the sky was smiling and bright.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the two Nato nations.
There have been differences between them for issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's entry into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is the home of most Turkish people outside Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters were in her vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan, many of them Kurdar, also heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
The two protestant groups reflect the controversy of this visitor, who is commended as a hero of some Turks in Germany and hated as dictatorship by others.
Deptford collision: A wheelchairman died in a car collision
A wheelchairer died in a conflict with a car in London.
At 10.15 p.m., the convergence occurred near the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a large street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city.
The car’s driver stopped, and medical officers provided care, but the man died in an accident.
A couple of months after another biker died in a collision where a driver drove off on Childers Street, 1.5 km from the accident site of Saturday.
The police said she was working on identifying the man and informing his closest members.
The road has been closed and the buses have been directed, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards were injured in revolts
Six prison guards were injured when revolts broke out to men’s security prison, according to a prison agency announcement.
At 9.30 a.m., British local time on Sunday and still thawed, the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire broke out.
The “Tornado ” Special Forces have been called in the area to try to control the upheavals of eight prisoners and are only in one of the prison’s armies.
The guards were cared for because of minor face damage at the scene.
A prison agency spokesman said: “Specially trained prison guards have been called out to deal with cases in Long Lartin prison.
Six employees have been cared for because of injuries.
There is no violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that the responsible officers will be handed over to the police and could expect to spend even more time behind locks and bars."
More than 500 prisoners are in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, after a prisoner attacked him, the director of the prison had had to go to a hospital.
And in October of last year, the revolt police were called to the place to cope with serious conflicts in peace, where people were attacked with billions of dollars.
The hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with rapid flooding (drying area could benefit from)
It is uncommon to pass tropically across Arizona, but it is likely that it will occur early next week when the remnant of the hurricane of Rose crosses the southwest, at risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Agency has already issued warnings for rapid flooding before Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona and south and west Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rosa will cross Phoenix directly on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with a rainfall.
On Twitter, the Phoenix Weather Service said that “only ten winds were able to maintain strength to be classified as tropical storms or lower than 320 km away from Phoenix from 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 64 km away from Arizona border."
The last prediction from the center of the windstorm predicts 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, with a precipitate of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely that there will be a descendance of 2.5 to 5 cm in other southwestern regions, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with the possibility of exceptional rainfall up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of a sudden flood, the descendant of Rose could be blessed, for there is a great drought in the area.
Although a flood may cause great harm, some of these precipitations will have a positive effect, as a drought is now in the southwestern part.
According to the United States Desert Control, at least over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest, is dry," according to weather.com reports.
First, the hurricane of Rosa will land on the Baja California skag in Mexico.
Rosa still ranked as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind rate of up to 136 km/h and is 620 km/h south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at 19 km/h.
The storm crosses cooler seas in the Pacific, so its power is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected that he will land in Mexico as a tropical storm in the afternoon on Monday or Monday evening.
There is a potential for a high level of precipitation in some areas of Mexico, with a considerable risk of flooding.
“There is a precipitation of 7,5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm of precipitation, ” said the weather.com report.
Rosa will then travel north over Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach the borders of Arizona early on Tuesday morning as a tropical location. It will then continue up through Arizona and arrive at southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
“ The greatest danger is expected to come from Russia or its remains, ” said the National Fallstorm Center, “at Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the United States. ”
These rainfalls are expected to cause life - threatening rapid floods and soil movements in the wilderness, and crawling in the mountain ends.
Midsomer Norton assault: Four murder arrests
Three adolescents and a 20 - year - old man have been arrested for a murder attempt, after a 16 - year - old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The youth was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 a.m. to British locality on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition was said to be “stabilized. ”
One 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - old, and one 20 - year - old man was arrested at night in Radstock, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have been waiting for a witness who could have phone recordings of what happened to surrender.
Trump says that Kavanaugh “has got to feel the evil and the wrath ” of the Democratic Party.
“Assistance to the support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the cruel and disgusting methods of the Democratic Party, ” said Trump in a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “came to feel the evil and the wrath ” of the Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the Assembly on Thursday, where he hardly denyed Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations that he was abusing her sexually some decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnessed to the Committee about his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that “American people had seen Kavanaugh’s genius and humanity and courage the other day.
“Attribute to the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a magnificent CV as an official staff,” he said to a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of the participation of the supporters of the Republic of Germany in the mid - period surveys.
“ There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't offer myself, but I really do," he said.
“ That’s why I go across the fields to fight for great candidates. ”
Trump claimed that the Democrats were working on “saving and blocking. ”
The first key vote on the Old Age Board's floor on the nomination of Kavanaugh should not take place later than Friday, according to the assistant of the leaders of the Republic of CNN interview.
Hundreds of people died after earthquakes and flood waves in Indonesia, and likely to increase the number of dead
At least 384 died, and many were scattered away when huge waves were blown off on the beaches, when a great earthquake and a floodwave crossed the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the coast of Pala on Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] high waves hit the beach at sunset, scattered a number of people on the sea, and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The flood wave developed after an earthquake of 7.5 points on Richter.
“ When the flood threat began yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they died, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the Indonesia Disaster Institute, at an information meeting in Jakarta.
“ The flood wave did not come alone, she drew cars, tree drums, houses, she hit everything on land, ” said Nugroho, adding that the flood wave had traveled over the open sea at 800 miles [800 km] before she hit the beach.
Some climbed into a tree to escape the flood wave and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Pala.
Photos from air, published by the Disaster Institute, showed many ruined buildings and shops, twisted, and degraded bridges, and mosque surrounded water.
Aftershaking continued to ride over the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were observed in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Foundation on Food and Technology, stated in a statement that the energy released in the big tremor on Friday was about 200 times higher than the atomic bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geographic location at the end of a long and narrow flea could have increased the size of the flood wave, said the Agency.
Nugroho said the damages were “very ” and that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels had collapsed.
The body of some victims was found trapped under a crashed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the losses and damages could be higher along the coastline 300 miles north of Pala in an area called Donggala, near the earthquake.
Communication “Looking completely down, and there is no information from Donggala, ” Nugroho said.
“ More than 300,000 people live there, ” said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the area in question.
“ This has already become a tragedy, but could become much worse, ” said the Red Cross.
The Agency was criticized by many people on Saturday for not informing them about the fact that Palu had been overwhelmed by a flood, although official representatives said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a video published on the media, you could hear a cry from the upper floor of buildings to warn the people on the street below that a flood was approaching.
Just minutes later, the flood wave strikes on the beach and cars carry away buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't confirm the video right away.
The earthquake and the flood wave caused an electric loss that hindered Pala’s communication and made it difficult for the authorities to organize relief work.
According to the authorities, the army has begun to send airplanes with food supplies from Jakarta and other cities, but people who have been helped by the area still need food and other needs.
The city airport has only been reopened for aid and will be closed until October.
Joko Widodo, President is going to visit refugee centers in Pala on Sunday.
The number of deaths reaches over 800 after a flood wave in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
The people of the World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where they seek refuge in tent cities that were set up in the park outside their offices.
“ People said they saw many houses ruined, ” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Helping groups have started difficult relief work, but some have complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and staff can only be started if the accident area is declared a disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“ This is still a local accident area, ” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared this a disaster area, we can open for foreign aid, but no declaration has yet been made."
On the second night, after the earthquake and the Flood wave on Friday, friends and their families who are still missing held in the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracle stories that will give hope to the depressing headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued out of the sewers.
On Sunday, help workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under ruins for two days with her mother’s body at his side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian flying team, had been the trainer of two missing flyers for the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were locked in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“As a man with long experience in flying, I have my own emotional burden to carry, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hour after the news was received within the flying group because the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed, he would have sent WhatsApp messages in desperate hope to the competitors who stayed in Palu and participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only a grey mark, instead of blues.
“I think it means that the message was not received, ” he said.
Thieves steal $26.750 at a Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from Brink's staff, who was filling up the Newport on the Leveee, according to a Newport police report.
The car’s driver had been emptying a fast bank in the entertainment area and was filling more money on it, said Detective Dennis McCarthy, in the announcement.
When he was at work, another man “runs back to the Brink employee ” and steals a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects flee from the scene, according to the announcement, but the police did not specify how many people were involved in the matter.
Those who could have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West, the rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name-- to Ye.
On Saturday, he announced the change in Twitter and wrote: “The creature previously known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change occurs in his participation in the Saturday Night Live show where he is expected to announce his new record, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi on the show, but for “emotional reasons, ” said the manufacturer.
West has said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also a shortening of his present name.
“ I believe “ye ” (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you, ” said West earlier in the year when he spoke the name of his album to the radio show manager Big Boy.
“ So I am you. I am us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, and over to just Ye - to be just a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous rapists who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former associate of West, has also written his name with and without bands and upper letters.
The chosen President of Mexico promises not to use the military against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians, now the country will soon remember 50 years of bloody revenge for students.
On Saturday at the Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised that “the army will never use it to oppress the people of Mexico. ”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot a peaceful protest march in the marketplace and drowned up to 300 people at the time when the left - minded movement of students was rooting all over Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving monthly support to all students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of study opportunities attract young people to gangs.
The United States should double the cost of artificial intelligence
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the funding it spends in research in that field, says the inventor and the artificial user Kai-Fu Lee who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were reported after the United States’ various departments announced artificial intelligence, even if the United States did not have a formal overall satellite intelligence program.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in the new creation with artificial intelligence before 2030.
“ It would be a good start to double the funding that goes into artificial research, given that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence, ” Lee said.
Duplication of funding could double the chance that the next major discovery of artificial intelligence will be made in the United States, said Lee to the CNBC during this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, ” published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director of the company Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of the major artificial companies in China.
In the 1980 ’ s, he worked with an artificial intelligence system at the Carnegie Mellon University, who won the best player in the United States in Othello, and later he was director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee spoke of previous technical competitions held by the U.S. authorities, such as the Autobot Defense Department, and asked when the next race would be held to see the next primer.
Researchers in the United States often have to put forth a lot of effort to get the strength of the government, said Lee.
“It’s not China that captures the main thoughts, but the companies, ” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired genius from colleges to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen their artificial research.
“ I feel that those who have an artificial doctoral degree should be granted a residence permit automatically, ” he said.
China’s Congress published its future satellite programme in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation, like the National Science Foundation and the same official organizations in the United States, provides funds for people who work at university institutes, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Department set up an artificial intelligence center designed to cooperate with both industrial and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a special panel of artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
In the case of NSF, it invests over $100 million annually in artificial intelligence studies.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation designed to create a security advice for artificial intelligence has not been available for months.
Macedonians vote in national votes on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia chose to vote on a national vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of the country to the “Northern Macedonia” in an attempt to resolve a ten-year conflict with Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbours in the north corresponds to the requirement of their territory and therefore refuses to enter NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the self - image of the majority of Macedonia’s inhabitants of slavery.
Mr. Gerge Ivanov, President has said that he will not participate in the vote and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach 50 percent of the minimum required for the vote to be considered valid.
The question at the election bill is: “Would you like to join NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece? ”
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is a reasonable cost for Macedonia to join the alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those created after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, for it means a safer life for all of us, ” said the 79 - year - old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the conclusion is not legally binding, enough congressmen have said that they will apply it and bind it into law.
The name change would require two thirds of the Senate's approval.
The election committee said that there was no announcement of anything unusual at 1 a.m.
However, only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent, were involved in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“ I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe, ” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 - year - old, in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, Zorica's wife, and Dushko's son, voted in the Macedonian national vote on whether to change the name of the country, which would pay its way into Nato and the European Union, Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Congress, 54 - year - old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small field and setting up chairs in front of tents that had been built by those who would ignore the vote.
“We are favoured by NATO and the EU, but we want to be members with our heads high, not through the service door, ” said Kavardarkov.
“ We are a poor land, but we have dignity.
If they do not agree to us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia and become part of the European Union."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, a member of NATO will transfer the necessary funding to Macedonia, where the proportion of the unemployed is over 20 percent.
“I believe the longest majority will agree because more than 80 percent of the EU and Nato are favoured, ” Zaev said after paying his vote.
He said that consent would be “a confirmation of our future. ”
A survey published on Monday from the Macedonia Policies Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the national contribution, which is lower than the minimum required.
Another television television survey showed that 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they were going to say yes.
So the national vote is valid, 50 percent of the vote must be reached, plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could mean the first serious shock for the government's policy, which is advocated by the Western countries, since it took place in May of last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, player of Manchester City, goes through all the defense of Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made the defense of Brighton in the victory of Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculous when he scored his goal in 65 minutes.
At the start of the campaign, the Argentinaian prominence received a transmission in the middle of the field.
He ran past three defensive men of Brighton, and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green - dressed defenders.
He got past one defensive man and then ran away from another one just at Brighton's wit.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English prominent used the first touch within the body to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to play on Mathew Ryan, the target Brighton, with a shot on the right side of the target.
“Aguero has some foot problems, ” said Pep Guardiola, director of City, to the press.
“ We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky he scored at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the blue ones the first goal in the election game.
That goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero had a long shipment in Brighton's valle half in that direction.
He sent a great long ball on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent to Sterling toward the remote bar.
A prominent city sent the ball to the net just before it ran out.
On Tuesday, on Rhein-Necker Stadium, Sinsheim, Germany, City is at the Hoffenheim Championship.
Scherzer wants to play a play against Rockies.
Since the Nationals team has been excluded from the finals, there was no good reason to force another start.
But the enthusiastic Scherzer hopes to be thrown on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have a chance to get to the finals, but they have one play ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the western division.
At least Rockies got a Wildcard seat with their 5-2 wins at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still trying to reach their first division title.
“ Even if we play free, at least we can play for an electric atmosphere in Denver, as well as the other team will certainly play its best game this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete in such a situation?"
Nationals will still report who will be the first caster in the Sunday game, but they are thought to have Scherzer thrown in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was starting a game for the 34th time, took a practice session on Thursday and would throw on a Sunday, which is his usual Sabbath.
This right-handed caster at Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 wind blows in 220 2/3 cycles during this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president inadvertently referred to the case around Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Judge, when he spoke of the importance of the participation of the supporters of the Republics in the mid - period surveys.
“ Everything is at stake in November.
It's five weeks in one of our most important elections.
It's one of the big, big... I don't offer myself, but I do, but that's why I'm going across the fields to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, radical group of democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to go to get power and control, they just want to get power and control, we don't give it to them.
He said that the Democrats were working on “toughing and blocking. ”
“And it has been seen for the last four days, ” he said and said, “the Democrats are angry and wicked and cruel and unfaithful. ”
He named Senate Senator Dianne Feinstein, a leading demokrat in the Senate Committee, and he was answered with a loud voice from the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who failed the document?
Ha, what.
No, look no, I waited for one... it was really bad body-training, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The team of workers is no longer an intolerant church.
He Is Resisting Those Who Express His Thought
When my group's activist Moments chose to give me a reproach, it was hardly surprising.
After all, I am the last of many of the workers who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our minds.
Joan ryan, my congressman, was treated similarly because she strongly objected to prejudice against Jews.
In my case, the proposition to give me a blasphemy was made because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were important for responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues and Jeremy disagreed with the former leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East meeting on Friday said that “we want the meetings not to understand and to be successful. ”
During my eight - year career as the working party's congressman, Friday meetings have been the most frequently.
Sadly, it is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of “milder and better ” politics has been forgotten if it ever began.
It has been more and more evident that different views have not been made in the Workers’ Party and that all opinions are judged by whether the leaders of the group consider them acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when co-workers who I once thought had similar political views to me began to expect me to take a complete reversal and support views that I had never agreed before, whether about national security or a common EU market area.
Every time I speak publicly--and then it doesn't matter what I'm saying-- it's like a little disgusting in the community media that are called after my disfellowship, central politics denied and told me that I shouldn't be in the Workers Team.
And this is not just my experience.
I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, where most of the comments I get to myself are usually political.
I admire the professionality and firmness of those who have to endure the breakdown of sexual or prejudiced insults every day but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing things in this political period is how attacks and insults have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Workers Group should support a tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer intolerant to churches, and with each distrust measure or change in the rules, the class becomes increasingly narrower.
For the last two years, I have been advised not to be too high, and I would be “all right. ”
But I did not decide to take part in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Workers Team as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the Government of Thatcher who left my school office in depressed state, I have fought for a better public service for those who need it most, whether in a city government or in a council.
I've never hid my political views, nor at the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policies and where I disagree with the current leaders.
With the supporters of the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country is headed for Brexit, which will harm our home, company, and public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Workers.
But my only message I want to send from me is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those who are within my district, whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threat of apostasy or political disfellowshipping will scare me from doing what I think is for the best of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An unconquered team of Ayr goes to the top
Two late touch limits may have distorted the final result something, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory in this intriguing game of the day in Tennent's Premiership Department.
They are now at the top of the list and one of the ten people who are still unconquered.
Finally, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made the locals more victorious and Peter Murchie had the right to be content.
“ We have had hard opposition in our games so far and are still unconquered, ” he said, “so I have to be happy. ”
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “Air deserves commendation, they made better use of their opportunities than we did, ”
Mark Grant Anderson came Ayr over in 14 minutes after Frazier Climo turned the search, but a yellow card on the Scottish leader, who was allowed to play the game with Warriors, enabled Melrose to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot scored the touchdown.
Climo increased the lead of Ayr with hell before he scored with a kick just before half-playing and then touched the mark and came Ayr over 17-5 in half.
However, Melrose began the second half - game with strength and touched Patrick Anderson, after Baggot turned the search, reduced the target to five points.
Then a long break had to be made to sustain serious injuries from Ruaridh Knott, who had to carry a playground, and after that, Ayr still increased his leadership with touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the search.
Ayr’s leader, Blair Macpherson, then got the yellow card, and Melrose again used to be a man touched by Bruce Colvine, at the end of the harder flock.
However, the locals came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for acquiring Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored the touch mark behind the Ayr follow-up, after an extra test.
Climo turned the search back, as he did again immediately after the start, after Kyle Rowe reached the kick of David Amrstrong from the Vitae and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the fifth touchdown of the team.
Stjärna Still Game programs ready for a new career in the restaurant owner
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game programs, seems ready to move himself to a restaurant after he was found to be the manager of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC shows that he writes and plays along with his old mate from the entertainment business, Creg Hemphil.
The Twice has announced that the future nineth series will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan has plans for Craiglang’s life.
According to official records, he is the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to say anything about the story, but the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to participate in the "living restaurant company" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours: the coastless land of Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way back to the Pacific
Marines are guarding the Navy headquarters of La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flags.
Flood stations from the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon River are marked with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
On the other hand, in the 19th century, all the landmarked Bolivia reminder of the coastline lost to Chile in bloody conflicts, still in fresh memory, along with the desire to sail again through the Pacific.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Hague on October 1, after five years of trial.
“ Bolivia, of course, has the power, the unity, and the conductlessness, waiting for the decision with a positive mind, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many residents of Bolivia will monitor the international court’s decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will decide Bolivia in favour of their obligation to give Bolivia access after decades of difficult discussions.
The decision on Monday is also very important to Evo Morales, the president of the country of Indians, who will be in a controversial fight for re-elections next year.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised late in August.
However, some analysts believe that the court’s decision would not change much if he did.
The Court of Justice, with headquarters in the Netherlands, has no authority to give a land from Chile and has decided that the decision will not affect the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the Court’s decision comes only six months after the final talks were heard indicates that “the matter had not been complicated, ” said Paz Sárate, a Icelandic international expert.
It is also possible that over the last four years, rather than Bolivia, has led to the land’s reversal.
“ Today’s Bolivia’s government has stolen the issue of access to the sea, ” said Zárate.
Morale’s convictions have diminished all goodwill from Chile, she thought.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk sometime, but it will be extremely difficult after that.
Since 1962, the two countries have not shared ambassadors.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the Hague country, rejected the idea that the decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Chile ” and an opportunity to“ put an end to a controversy that is about 139 years back in time, both countries to benefit, ” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this subject as a political chicken.
“ Bolivia will never give up his right to have access to the Pacific, ” he added.
“The crop is an opportunity to see that we have to recover from the past. ”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear decommissioning unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, Foreign Minister of North Korea says the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri held his talk on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His remarks now come when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Minister, seems to be starting again on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea.
Ri says that it is “drømmers ” to continue with the continuation of a business prayer and protest against the United States declaration of the end of Korea’s war will ever crush North Korea.
Washington doesn't want to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes a clear action to take down its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there is great doubt that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country probably views as the only way to secure its safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
fashion shows in Paris introduce the latest line of big headswear that will come to fashion shops near you
If you want to expand your hat library or be completely hidden from the sun, you don't have to look further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed many strange hats in their oversized SS19 line in the fashion field that fascinated the skier of the fashion week in Paris.
In the summer of Instagram, a number of images of very infinite hats have been published, and these designers have had their new creations to show in fashion.
The main work of Valentino was a large light - brown hat with large peaks that resembled feathers and covered the motels ’ heads.
Of other parts of oversized size, watermelons could be seen put with jewels, soap hats, and even pineapples, but these things are not designed to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced many strange masks, just at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had composite lips and were rather like Hannibal Lecter than high - fashioned.
One mask was like a dipping device with a respiratory pipe and glasses, while others were like melting ice cream in a bread form.
If you want to go to the fashion, you're lucky.
fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
Large hats come to the heels of “La Bomba, ” a straw hat with over 60cm large barrels that have decorated their heads from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion mark on the back of the very unhandled hat that was seen on all community centers was inspired by another large component that appeared in the fashion scene — a straw seal that was almost as large as the swimmered model that wore it.
The orange strata, with a shaving and white leather handle, was the main part of the La Riviera SS10 fatality of Jacquemus on the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, the styleist of the famous people, said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in the fashion stores for the next summer — where the designer has caused such a great influence, it should be difficult to ignore requests for oversized items. ”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the world’s citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding results of their students, and this has continued in 2018 with new, magnificent test results, which are still strengthened by individual and group ignorance in sport, art, music and other community cultures.
These schools have up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (Schoss Private School Council, SCIS) in defense for them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim at preparing their students for further continuing studies, the career they have chosen, and their position as world citizens.
As a class class that can compile and teach by specially designed programs, we see that new languages continue to be popular in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it affects his mind.
If you speak to him in his mother's language, it touches his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can not just rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other lands.
The test results of this year show that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest proportions of students who carry out tests in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned foreign languages were acquainted with A.
The data collected from 74 schools in the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the A - in - mandarin, while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners also received the A - grade.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
At the moment, languages, as a selection, are placed in the same place as scientific studies (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in personal school and elsewhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that for the reasons given by employers that it was difficult to employ jobs, 17 per cent was because people with language skills were lacking.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important in preparing young people for their future work.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a global world.
No matter what career people choose, they will have a real precedent in the future if they learn another language, which is knowledge that lasts their lives.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multi-weighted person a predecessor to competitors.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to maintain conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two - letter percentage, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest immediately in language teaching.
Several weights, especially in new market countries, will give children a better opportunity to find important jobs.
In Scotland, schools differ from one language to another.
A certain number of schools will focus on classical new languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for Britain in the year 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest is, it will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Researchal private schools commit themselves to offering a study environment that will prepare and prepare children with the skills they need to achieve, whatever the future will bring.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a global business environment, languages continue to be necessary for the future of the country, and they must be reflected in education.
Really, modern languages should be viewed as “international skills in communication. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, variability and superiority for young Scotland.
Il faut the bee le faire.

LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is soon ended for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Luke Walton, Lakers Coach, has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided in how many minutes he will play.
“ It will be longer than one minute and shorter than 48, ” said Walton on Laker’s official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After exercising earlier this week, James was asked his plans for six games of Laker’s program for the beginning of the season.
“ During this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare, ” he said.
Timeout for Trump election meeting in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a lot of election meetings and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop at friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election of a new Supreme Court Judge has been suspended, Trumped therefore aims to build up support for the next mid-term surveys, because the Republic of Germany is at risk of losing control over the Senate when voting in November.
What time is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin at 7:00 to the eastern time tonight, Saturday 29 September, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia on the Internet below through direct broadcasting on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer the case to Brett Kavanaugh, a appointed Supreme Court Judge, where the accusations of sexual injuries were accused of, the vote of the Senate to confirm him as a judge, held in a waiting position for up to a week while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the main objective of Trump’s meetings is to help the Republicans get better, but they are waiting for difficult elections in November.
Therefore, the message from Trump’s election campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, aim to “fill volunteers and supporters of enthusiasm when the Republicans try to protect and increase their majority in the Senate and Congress, ” according to Reuters News Office.
“ The government of the Senate is so essential for the President’s plan that he will travel to as many states as possible now that a busy campaign period begins, ” said an unappointed spokesman from Trump’s campaign at Reuters News Office.
The meeting will be held tonight at the Wesbanco stadium in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and that the media from Pittsburgh tells about it, ” according to the West Virginia Metro News Agency.
The meeting on Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, but he won with more than 40 percent difference in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to help Patrick Morrissey, the candidate of the Republic of West Virginia to the Senate, but he's in the bottom of the polls.
“ It’s not good to Morrissey that the president has to come and try to increase his popularity, ” said Simon Haeder, a political expert at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuter’s news office.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows its willingness to keep the hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three one - sided circles, the four - game, which was afternoon on Saturday, could be exactly what was needed in this race for the Ryder cup.
Successful fluctuations are a sport concept that has been invented and truly believed by players, and never more than in the race like this.
Where would they say that success is now?
“They had six points ahead, and now it is four points, so the success lies rather on our side now, I guess, ” said Jordan Spieth when he set off in the race of the day.
Of course, Europe has the forefront, four points ahead, with 12 more at stake.
As Spieth said, the Americans believe that they have a little wind in their sails, and they can be hopeful over many things, especially the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and who got three points out of four.
Spieth has played greatly from the surface and leads by his example.
As the ring drew, the shouts of good news increased, and he put down an important pillow to get all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points below after two games.
His powd, who secured them the victory of the 15th hole, shouted similarly, of the kind that tells you that he believes that the American team still has a victory hope.
"You just have to dive deep and think about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to work in points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder cup.
This strange but fascinating European couple has won four games of four and cannot do anything wrong.
“ Moliwood ” was the only couple who had a bad afternoon on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid slopps on Saturday morning, afternoon on Friday and at the nine holes of the field on Friday morning.
The game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audiences clearly shows that they are the couple that has to conquer on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the potential victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, the sun is seated on the Le Golf National Field.
The best option is that both of you did it at the same time on different holes.
It is still too early to talk about the European team’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were lightly treated with Sergio Garcia, the four - day hero, where he played with Alex Noren.
In the first nine holes, the Spanish and the Swedes buried into a hole that they never got to scratch.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four balls and the four games are so exciting to watch close through the communications between the couples, their advice, the advice they don’t give, and how a program can change in one way.
Europe has played better so far and has a significant predecessor for the final day, but this four - game lot also showed that the American team has the struggle that some had doubted, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 leader for the final day of the race for the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good precedent for the final day of Ryder’s cup after four balls and the fourth of Saturday, with the forefront of 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, with two victories, led the attack over Tiger Woods, who had problems, and had four points at the Le Golf National Field.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, who would like to bring back the prize cup that it lost at the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the United States team in the four - ball game of the morning and won 3-1.
The United States showed more opposition in the four games and won two games, but they did not win the score.
Jim Fury's team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who wins four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname “Molliwood” after a marvelous weekend, are only one couple who wins four points from their first four games in the Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they showed a lot of strength and defeated Woods and the U.S. newcomer Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius occasionally, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball games and four-game games and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who was suspended for the four-ball game of the morning, returned to her partner, Henrik Stenson in the four-games, and they won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - which are in the first and third seats on the list of the best golfers in the world.
However, Europe did not succeed in this mild and dazzling day southwest of Paris.
Three times a winner in the golf race, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the target for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They worked with difficulties 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in four-ball games and later came back and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the four games after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder’s cup has a team won four points at the start of an individual race, although Fury’s team only needed a drawer to continue the cup.
However, after being the second - best for two days, they seem to be overwhelmed by a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says one-sided decomposition “is impossible” without trust
On Saturday, the U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs told the Swedish Government that the continuing business prayer was only to shrink on their distrust in the United States, and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons alone under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated at the UN General Annual Assembly that North Korea had taken “very much action to show goodwill ” in the last year, for example by halting nuclear and missile tests, taking down the nuclear test area, and promising to put an end to the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“ On the other hand, ” he said, “we have not seen any corresponding reaction from the United States. ”
“ Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the safety of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons once. ”
Although Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to “stage change ” approach to nuclear decomposition, where North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement seemed special in the sense that he did not deny one-sided nuclear devastation purely, as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to the joint declaration of Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader, in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work on “the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean Gulf, ” and Trump promised to ensure the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has been looking for a solution to formal end the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax a strict trade ban against North Korea.
“ The U.S. demands that “nuclear devastation take place first, ” and increases pressure by using business prayers to achieve its own, and even protests the declaration of ending the war, ” Ri said.
“ It’s only fantasies of people who don’t know anything about us to think that a business prayer can break our knees.
But the problem is that continuing business prayer increases our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, the U.S. leader of the United States, earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister spoke of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea, in the last five months, and added: “If the member of this nuclear decommissioning issue was South Korea instead of the United States, this would not be the plight in the case of nuclear decommissioning on the Korean coast. ”
In spite of this, the tone in Ri’s speech last year was very different from his speech when he said at the general Assembly that it would be inevitable to direct missiles from North Korea to the United States, after “the demon - filled President ” Trump called Kim“ a missile man ” for a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened to “destruct ” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim of the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards decommissioning, but said that much work was still left and that business prayers had to continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timeline for this, saying: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say the SÞ Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, the U.S. Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, of the UN Security Council on Thursday said: “The Security Council’s trade request must continue until complete nuclear decommissioning has taken place and confirmed. ”
The Security Council agreed to increase business prayers in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to close funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline at the General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later North Korea condemned him for making “criminal demands. ”
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to take down missiles and nuclear stations if the United States took action “corresponding operations. ”
He said that Kim told him that the “corresponding actions ” he was looking for were guarantees for security that Trump promised in Singapore and actions towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Teaching Course in Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an attempt to counteract the growing tendency of students to stay awake and learn all night by using caffeine tablets.
A study revealed that students at the world’s best university often know little or nothing about the basic points of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School, and an expert at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believes that it sees the first of its kind in the United States.
He was given the idea of conducting a course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep on the ability to study.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, “Why am I told this first now, in my last year? ”
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to Telegraph.
The study for the first time this year explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits help study and performance in sports and even contribute to general well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and director of the School Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were very sleepless over the week.
The course is an hour and includes several interactive projects.
In one section, there is a picture of a room in the home, where students click a cup of coffee, window curtains, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sports performance can worsen with the lack of sleep, along with the importance of a good routine for sleep.
In other parts, participants are told how long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area by means of interactive signs then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“ We know this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we feel that they have the right to know this, just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that covers those who stay awake and learn all night long, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep shortages were growing problems.
Insurance of sufficient sleep of good quality should be “secret weapons ” for students to resist stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said — even to avoid fatigue, because the brain’s lack of sleep increases its appetite for food so that the body is starving.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old student in chemistry and physics from California, helped Professor Czeisler to compile his course, who sat one of the professor's couchs last year at Harvard.
He said that his course opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students in school.
He hopes that the next step will have to ask all master students to finish a similar course before they start studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting the alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to awaken them, and consider the harmful effects of blue light that electronic screens and LED lights provide, but it can confuse the inner clock of the body and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
Rangers still had problems in the field when Steven Gerrard's split team had to accept 1-0 losses at Livingston, by mark from Dolly Menga.
The team of Ibrox wanted to win his first win at the end of his victory at St. Johnstone in February, but the team of Gary Holt gave Gerrard's team only another loss in his 18 games as manager. The team is now eight points behind Hearts, who is at the top seat of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before half - game, and Rangers' team seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to recover.
Rangers now fall to the sixth seat, but Livingston goes to the third and is only behind Hibernian in a major difference.
Rangers may be in further trouble after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for head injury after any object was thrown into him from the half of the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that swept Ayr away and made the precipitate in the Betfred cup.
Holt, on the other hand, maintained the same Livi 11 setup that reached a level of Heart in the last week, and he would have been pleased with how well - trained men chose the opposition.
Rangers might have had more of the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the balls it reached.
They should have scored only two minutes after the stage when the first shipment from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allans McGregors, but he shot by.
A long spare from Keaghan Jacobs then ended with Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow, his defense partner, shot past the remote bar.
Rangers returned to control the game, but they appeared to live in hope rather than believe in their game at the end of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that he should have had a hell when a quarter of him and Steven Lawless had left the game, but the judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Columbia Man’s call.
Rangers only achieved two target shots in the first half, but Liam Kelly, the former target Ibrox, did not have to do much to protect bald Lassana Coulibaly and easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the opportunity from Livi in a 34th minute had occurred despite the fact that the other side had been overrun, no one can deny that they deserved it, but only because of their endurance.
Rangers again failed to do anything out of Jacob's long back.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and chose to send to Menga, which then was easy to challenge.
Gerrard took his advice in half a game and sent Ryan Kent into the place of Coulibaly, and the exchanges had an effect as soon as the backguard came in Morelos, but Kelly quickly reacted and ran forward to closing the shot.
Still, Livingston continued to trick the guests to play exactly the kind of game they enjoy playing and Lithgow and Halkett got each long transmission after one.
Holt's team could have increased their leadership in the final minutes, but McGregor did well to deny Jacobs an opportunity before Lithgow ran to the point of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Rangers' backup, wanted another hell when he and Jacob fell together, but Thomson rejected it again.
Calendar: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a magazine from our calendar “Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and AUTH... this is the day that future physicist John Wilhelm “Hans ” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of studying and measuring radioactivity, and this invention eventually led to a device called Geiger.
The Geiger meter has since become a permanent position in the science world, but was also popular in pop culture, such as in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado, ” with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: “What the hell is this? ”
Rogers: “This is Geiger, used to find radioactive substances such as uranium.
When you put these hearing instruments on you, you can hear the effects of the atoms due to radioactivity in the stones."
Evans: “There is indeed now! ”
“ Hans ” Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to know dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment includes taking immune cells from the patient and changing them to a laboratory
Then they can “see” proteins commonly in many cancer cells and then be injected back into the patient
Experimental vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months; the vaccine teaches immune cells to know dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them to a laboratory so that they can “se” a protein called HER2 and be found in many types of cancer, and then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States Cancer Institute at Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that the vaccine is very effective. ”
HER2 “stops various types of cancer, ” including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and colon and anal,” said Professor Berzofsky.
Similar methods in which immune cells are taken from patients and which “discient” to attack cancer cells have been effective in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long symposium to support Trump and carried the MAGA hat after appearing in the TV show SNL.
It didn't end well.
Baulade was at Kanye West in the Saturday Night Live studio, after a long - term talk, commending President Donald Trump of the United States, who said that he would volunteer for presidentship in 2020.
After carrying the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great Haube, he spoke long against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“ I have spoken so many times to white people who say: “How can you like Trump, he is a racist? ”
If I was concerned about racial hatred, I would long be moved from the United States, ” he said.
SNL started with a cable where Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Committee for the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford on sexual injuries.
Although West’s long - end was not sent out, the video of it was placed on the social media by Chris Rock’s comedian.
I don't know if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the tape.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received bad backstage reception because of his hat choice.
“ I was bullied backstage.
They said to me: “Do not go up to the field with this hat. ”
They mocked me!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to the news from Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Would you like to see the deep hole? ” and said that he would put on his superhero cloth, “because that means that you can’t order me to do things; do you want the world to make progress?
Try love."
According to Variety, at least two of his comments were received by the audience, and SNL’s actors appeared to be embarrassing, and one attendant said to the newspaper: “There was stone silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariöna Grande, whose boyfriend, Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many by his stage performance when he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, Chairman of the Conservative Party TPUSA, on Twitter: “To one of the brave souls: TAKE TO SUPPLY MOVE. ”
But on Twitter, chat program manager Karen Hunter said that West was simply being “he himself, and it’s just wonderful. ”
“ But I didn’t choose to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his “list ”) that I think supports and spreads my harmful society’s ideology.
He's free.
It's us, too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now “the being that was previously known as Kanye West. ”
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not be forgotten the musical myth of Prince, who changed his name to a sign and later called himself the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Accused of a murder trial following a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45 - year - old man has been accused of a murder attempt after being stabbed to a restaurant in the eastern Belfast on Tuesday.

The defendant is expected to be in Belfast court on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of the Crown Games, criticizes toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventures from HBO, the Crown Games.
The 31 - year - old actor, however, has criticized the status of the male hero and says that such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they need to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that “nothing went wrong ” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood during the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his accomplice from the Crunch Games, the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, acknowledged that he had “a stronger opinion ” on how to deal with this issue.
"Perfectly, I think at the moment - what has gone wrong with the manhood?"
“ What have we taught men in their upbringing, about the problems we see now? ”
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for an increase in manly poison because of a very manly person on TV.
He continued: “What is congenital and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that make young boys feel like they have to be made by a man?
I think it's one of the most important questions of the time -- how do we change this?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong with young men."
He also acknowledged during the interview that he would not play in any other Crunchy shows after the series is similar to the next summer and said that he had received “enough of battlefields and horses. ”
From November Kit will play in the regeneration of True West, a picture by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently said that the best part of playing in the Crunch Games was to meet his wife, Rose.
“ I met my wife in these aspects, ” he said, “so they gave me some of my future family and my life after that. ”
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's lover who Kit played in these Emmy prize shows.
The couple married in June 2018, in the country of Lesli’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with the HIV virus or with AIDS.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
Some 40,000 new infections were reported only during the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new infections were sexually transmitted, which is a change from what was before.
Earlier, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the administration of infected blood.
On the other hand, the number of HIV-infected in this way has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese health professionals said at the Yunnan County Conference.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
Sex-induced HIV infection is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but much discrimination against LGBT people is still taking place.
Due to conservative values in the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections result from insufficient contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, China’s Government has promised everyone access to HIV drugs as part of the plan to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the fact that a staff member has leaked data from the Senate members of the Republic, criticizes “hazardous lies ” and“ conspiracy teachings ”
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a congresswoman denied the charge that one of her staff had published personal information on their Wikipedia websites for three Senate Senators of the Republic.
The Los Angeles Democrat said that these claims came from “superior ” extremists and websites.
“ Liar, lies, and other pathetic lies, ” said Waters in a Twitter statement.
The information published contained, according to the addresses and phone numbers of American Congressmen Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday from an unknown party at Capitol Hill during the interrogation of the Senate Department at Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Judge, for the accusations of sexual injuries.
The leak arrived sometime after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Containing pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP numbers identifying the source of the information were connected to Waters office and published information on one of her employees, according to Capitol Hill information.
“ This unreasonable accusation is completely wrong and pure lie, ” continued Waters.
“ My personal data and security is now at risk because of these wrong accusations — in no way was responsible for this information leak.
This unreasonable accusation is completely wrong and pure lie."
Waters ’ statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including Ara Fleischer, former White House News Officer.
“This denial is full of anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“ It suggests that she has no mood to sit in a congress.
When a person is accused without reason, he must not react with anger.
There is no opposition.
Do not ask about the reasons of the accuser.
"There must be calm and overwhelming."
Fleischer seemed to compare the response of Waters to the criticism of a judge Kavanaugh, whom critics said seemed too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the Professional Republican against Waters, also said his views on Twitter.
“ If the truth is true, ” he shook.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had “knowed these false claims to the appropriate authorities and police officers.
“ We will ensure that the guilty will be found, ” she continued, “and that they will be brought to account for all the destructive and dangerous acts of all my employees. ”
Movie criticism for Johnny English Strikes again - a spynacronym with Rowan Atkinson proves to be powerless
It has become customary to look for Brexit references in all new pictures in Britain, which seem to apply in this resuscitation of the Johnny English comedy order - which started in 2003 with the Johnny English film and just woke back to life in 2011 with the Johnny English Reborn film.
Will this mighty satira say how clearly miserable we are as a new opportunity for the country to export?
Whether or not, Johnny English has been renewed for the second time — his name, above all, shows that he is designed for display in other than English - speaking countries.
Of course, he is a delusional secret serviceman who pretends to have fascinating charms but is a bit of a mix of Clouseau, dass of Mr. Bean, and a little drain of the man who played one note for the Chariots of Fire song at the opening festival of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also originally based on the traveler and the mysterious world city that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television advertisements, where he left everything in wreckage.
There's one or two fine points in this latest Johnny English picture.
I liked to see Johnny English walk to a helicopter wearing a middle-aged brine and his cherry blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson evidently shows his humor, but the humor seems rather powerful and strangely superficial, especially now that “severe ” movies such as James Bond and Mission Impossible pictures also offer jokes.
The joke seems more intended for children than adults, and I felt that the adventures Johnny English had not been as imaginative and focused as the silent jokes of Atkinson as Mr. Beans.
The perpetual prerequisite of the picture now is that Britain is in great trouble.
A computer hacker has broken into the UK's secret spy network and discovered the identity of all British spyers, to the greatest concern for the spy on the watch -- but unfortunately Kevin Eldon is in too little role.
This is the final line for the Prime Minister who is arrogant and controversial and already in great trouble because of enormous political impunity: Emma Thompson is doing his best with his role as a person to remind of Theresu May, but the manuscript is not many fishes for it.
Her counselors tell her that every active spy is in danger and that she must find someone who had sat down in a holy stone.
And there is Johnny English himself, now the principal of some great school, but also provides secret lessons in how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes that English offers to a spy school that reminds us of the film School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and meets Bough, formerly his long-term partner, who Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in that energyful role, Vicki Pepperdine does not fully let his light shine.
The spy-naturus that messes up everything in her Majesty's service has now returned to the gear and meets the dangerous Opheliu Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is impressed by the magic of the charming billionaire in the technology sector, who claims to be able to solve the computer problem of Britain: it is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their deceased journeys: they light up a fine French restaurant occupied as servants, they cause bad as they smuggle in the luxury rock of Volta, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to introduce themselves to the interior of Volta's house.
There is nothing left to save in this final point, but although the picture is featuring and energyful, the whole part of the child’s material is absorbed.
Medium good substance.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn't help but think: Can British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his skills?
The worker group refuses to draw up a four-day work week plan for the British, with the same salary as five days ago.
Jeremy Corbyn, the worker group, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but is paid for five.
According to the group, firms want savings generated from the revolution to artificial intelligence, and they want workers to benefit from one extra day.
In that case, staff may spend three days of weekends without lowering their wages.
Sources say that the idea would be “adjusted ” to the economic programme of the group and its approach to improving the benefits of workers.
The Trade Union Congress Working Party has supported the shortening of the working week for four days as a means for workers to take advantage of economic changes.
In the Sunday Times, a source from the upper sections of the Workers Group said: “It is estimated that policy review will be reported by the end of the year.
“The change will not take place in one night, but four days of work week is a target that matches the approach of the group to change the economy to the benefit of workers and the overall industry policy.”
The worker group would not be the first group to support this idea, but the green group promised a four - day working week in its election campaign in 2017.
However, the aim is not supported by the Workers Group as a whole.
A spokesman for the Workers Team said: “The four days of a work week are not on the class's policy paper, and the group is not considering the introduction. ”
John McDonnell, the business minister of the Defence Department, used the Workers Group conference last week to describe his ideas of social revolution within the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “unknown managers ” and“ merchants ” restaurant companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water management companies may not have all their shares back, since the government of the Workers' Group could “absorption” because of a guilty offence.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers into the management committees of companies and to create a common property fund to give 10 % of the assets of private companies to their staff, who could get 500 pounds of their annual income.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" if the FBI investigation at Kavanaugh could get them to change their minds.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week's delay in the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court Judge, and raises the question whether its findings could get the Senate Senate members to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, a reporter in the program “60 minutes” of the Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked that the FBI might reveal something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“ When the trial began, I said that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After the accusations were presented, I called and asked, “Did you do this? ”
He was firm, firm, firm."
Graham’s vote, however, seems unchangeable.
“ I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, ” he said, “and there was an incredible accusation that needed to change it. ”
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know that Brett firmly denied it, ” Graham added and addressed Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And not everyone she mentions on her name could confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I can't see anything new will change."
What is the International Civil Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
The International Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York, an annual musical event where a series of superstars will appear, and with a similarly effective policy, ending poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the International Civil Festival, and tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park, not only to listen to musical issues from Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival to end sore poverty before 2030.
The International Civilian Festival, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project (Global Poverty Project), which is an international campaign organisation that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of fighters against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (except for those who want to pay for the VIP tickets), guests had to complete various tasks, or "operations", such as doing voluntary work, sending e-mail to any of the world’s leaders, calling calls, or using other valid means to help draw attention to their goals of ending poverty.
But how much has the festival been accomplished, now that 12 years are about to reach the goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with a free concert really a way to convince people to call for operations, or is it just one so-called "click operation" - where people think they're doing something that's important by signing a list of demands on the Internet or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, calling for a number of different objectives.
It says that these actions helped the world’s leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over $35 billion that will affect lives over 2.25 billion before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notifications due to its actions, of which at least 10 billion has been invested or collected.
The group estimates that up to now the funding has directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and managers in Britain who work to “help children to enjoy themselves fully, ” and promised to give 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after having received 4700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, sponsors, governments around the world, and international citizens like you, we can allow the social injustice of malnutrition to belong to the past, ” said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition at the audience at London concerts in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 calls were sent for Britain to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
On a list of common questions on the group’s website, one question is: “Why do you think you can put an end to sore poverty? ”
The Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult task — sometimes we will fail constantly.
But, we will reach our goals, just as movements fought for the rights of civilians and the abolition of racial separation before us, because we are stronger together.
Among those of the events this year are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe, the event will be held in New York and the presentations will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a “hinder” to prevent the energy export of Russians, says the Minister of Interior
“ If necessary, ” says the U.S. Interior Secretary of State, Ryan Zinke, reported by Washington Examiner, “that Washington may use the Navy to prevent the power of Russia from reaching the market. ”
Zinke claimed that Russia’s aid to Syria, especially where the country works on the rightful government there, was awarded to explore a new market.
“I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is then that they want to do business with energy, as in Eastern Europe and its southern part, ” he should have said according to sources.
And, according to a public announcement, there are ways and methods to oppose it.
“ The United States can use the Navy to ensure that seaways are open and to create a barrier, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from them cannot be marketed, ” he said.
Zinke addressed a visitor to the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called “the voice of energy consumption ” in the United States.
He continued and compared Washington’s approach to fighting Russia and Iran and said that she was more or less the same.
“ The economic option for Iran and Russia is more and less exploited and replaced by energy, ” he said, “and Russia has only one card in memory of the economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come after the Trump regime wants to increase its exports of gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, official staff in Trump's regime, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project of putting into place a new energy channel, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the 11 billion dollars of Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline, which will double the transportability of the current route up to 110 billion rúms, is only a economic project.
The Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply continued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“ I believe we share the view that energy may not be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the supplies, ” said Aleksandr Novak, Russia’s energy minister, after a meeting with the United States Energy Minister Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of German Industry (BDI) has called on the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and with a double-sided agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“ I’m very uncomfortable with the fact that foreign states are involved in our PGE, ” said Dieter Kempf, Chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) of a recent meeting with Angelu Merkel, German Chancellor, and Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will ‘ consider seriously ’ to present himself to the presidential office in 2020, says she.
On Saturday, senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said that after the mid - term surveys, she would “will consider ” her ‘ seriousness ’ to offer herself up to a president.
Warren confirmed that she would consider volunteering for a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and control our government, and then a woman needs to be a leader, ” she said, according to a report from The Hill.
“ After November 6, I will seriously consider being a president. ”
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump at the meeting and said: “He is taking the country to the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, ” she said.
Warren has been ignorant of his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Court Judge.
On Friday, on Twitter, Warren said that “we need to have the FBI investigate before the vote takes place. ”
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that the majority of the voters in Warrens state do not think it should be available in 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of the “probable ” voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not volunteer, according to a survey published by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent claimed to support her offer.
The survey showed more support for Deval Patrick, former governor, where 38 percent claimed to support his possible offer and 48 percent claimed to be against it.
Among other popular Democrats discussed for possible presidential promotion in 2020, Joe Biden, former Vice President, and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said he was going to make an official decision in January, according to a report from the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin's talking about Track Palin's shock attack at Donald Trump's election meeting.
Track Palin, 26 years old, was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
“My son is experiencing great difficulties after returning, I feel with other families who feel the impact of shock trauma and the spiritual wounds that our soldiers return home with, ” she said to the audience at a election meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room, ” saying that her son and other war soldiers“ would come back just differently, they are harsh and wonder if there is any respect for what their companions in the army and the Air Forces and other military divisions have done for the land. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, for attempting to prevent the announcement of domestic violence and for arms - carrying under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, the spokesman of the Wasilla police department.
18 states and Washington D.C. support a challenge against a new asylum seeker policy
Eighteen states and Washington City support a legal challenge against the United States' new policy which denies victims who flee from violence in their homes.
Deputies of the 18 states and the city submitted a legal report on Friday in Washington to support a refugee seeker who protests the policy, according to the news from NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. the prosecution of the American Civil Liberties Union organization has not been abandoned.
She said that her spouse “and his violent sons, who were walking members, ” used violence, but American government officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was put in custody in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where problems related to gangs and domestic violence are increasing, and the number of asylum seekers to the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum seeker policy revokes a decision issued by the Immigrant Board in 2014 to allow inadvertent immigrants who escaped domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement on Friday, Mr. Racine, State Prosecutor of Washington, said that the new policy “was overlooking decades of federal and international laws. ”
“The federal law requires a decision on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy is contrary to this rule, ” said the Court Report.
In the report, lawyers further stated that the policy that refused immigrants to enter would be harmful to the economy of the United States, claiming that immigrants were more likely to set up a company and “have an important work force. ”
Jeff Sessions, a state prosecutor, ordered immigrant judges to stop giving asylum to victims who escaped domestic violence and violence in June.
“ Those who leave their homeland because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or part of a particular social group or political survey can apply for asylum, ” said the session in its announcement on June 11.
Hail crews were never meant to solve all problems, not even all serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Despairing rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Palu who double the number of the dead
Conditions become more and more difficult for survivors.
“ There is great tension in the air, ” said Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, when she comforted her sick son in the relief center of Pala.
“ Infectious cars are bringing bodies here all the time.
There's little clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes and searching in their waterless possessions to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals are overwhelmed and damaged after the earthquake measured at 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke their backs and shoulders, were outside the Pala Army Hospital, where patients were favored outside because of continued powerful post-quakes.
His tears filled his eyes when he told him how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I pushed up to the wall drums, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press and said that his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“ I heard my wife call for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “persecutors ” by“ propaganda advertisements ”
A week after the official Chinese newsletter published a four - page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper to discuss mutual advantages in business between the two countries, the U.S. ambassador in China Peking accused the U.S. media to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, spoke last Wednesday about the advertising of the Chinese newspaper Des Moines Register, which is the most burnt newsletter in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to intervene in the United States Congresses, which will be on November 6, China refuses this accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to be involved in the United States Congress marketed what official American representatives said Reuters’ news office was a new stage in a growing campaign from Washington to use China’s pressure.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote business, Peking and Washington are in constant business war, with new customs on import goods from both countries.
Chinese and American experts say that early in the business war China’s vengeances were designed to harm foreigners in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Trumps.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador of China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, who is moving a lot of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
Branstad, in his Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register, stated that “the Chinese were now increasing their persecution by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free media. ”
“ By spreading its propaganda, China’s government is taking advantage of the loveful tradition of the United States and our free media by publishing costly advertising in the Des Moines Register magazine, ” Branstad said in his article.
“ On the other hand, there are few protestants in the streets of Beijing, and there is no true reflection of the different views that Chinese might have on the worrying economic policy of China, where the media are stuck under the Chinese Communist class, ” he wrote.
He added: “One of the largest newsletters in China failed to publish his article, but he did not say which magazine it was.
Experts warn that the Republicans are making female voters distracted from them for the mid-term surveys of the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned about negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid - period surveys, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Judge, who has been accused of sexual harassment.
There have been very strong feelings around this issue, and most Republicans have already officially shown that they wanted to start voting.
“ These things cannot be backed up, ” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the university Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, at The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that in the last minute of the FBI investigation, Jeff Flake, Senator of the Arizona Republic, would be able to calm angry voters.
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November, ” said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief counselor and spokesman for the free - tempered group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, the Protestants sang “November approaching! ” when they objected to the hallways of the Senate when, according to Mic, the Republicans who were in charge of the Committee of Decisions decided to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“ The interest and enthusiasm of voters will go out of power, ” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, on the news website.
“ People will say that the interest has already been great, and that is true.
But he could be bigger, especially in the female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who don't like the president, but seldom choose."
The analysts predicted a relapse if the Republicans pressed to confirm Kavanaugh, even for Ford’s testimony, in which she described her accusations of sexual anguish from him.
“ This has become a big mess for the Republican party, ” said Michael Still, former member of the National Committee of the Republic of Germany, early last week, according to NBC News.
“The issue is not only about the committee’s votes or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the class, but also about the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it, ” said Guy Cecil, President of Priorities United States, a group helping to vote Democrats at the news station.
However, the Americans seem to disagree with who to believe on the testimony of both Ford and Kavanaugh, and the majority of them support the latter.
A new survey from Yougov shows that 41 percent of the respondents believed the Ford testimony, while 35 percent claimed to believe in Kavanaugh’s certain or likely testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that Kavanaugh was probably or probably lied in their witnessing, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the Flake call, the FBI is now investigating the accusations presented by Ford and from at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, according to the Guardian report.
Ford witnessed the oath before the Senate Committee last week and said that Kavanaugh attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh carried his genitals in front of her when they were both at a party as a student at Yale University in the 1980 ’ s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to start new internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is going to set up a scepter company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the myth of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on a solid, open site of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access any information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “the dominion of the world. ”
"We have to do this now," he said about the scepter company.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "Personal Data Store on the Internet" or POD.
There can be a list of contacts, to-do lists, calendars, musical collections and other personal and work-related devices.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “performance by using data. ”
According to John Bruce, director of the company, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security facility purchased by IBM, several programmers hired as contractors to work in the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week onward, technology developers around the world could create their own independent programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to start a complete change that would put their current business model on the head in one night.
“ We don’t ask them permission. ”
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday in the Medium that Inrupt had “the objective of creating energy in business and ecosystems to protect the honesty and quality of the new web based on Solid. ”
Berners-Lee revolved the network in 1994 when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the discussion of the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he starts Inrupt.
“ I am full of optimism for the next period of the network, ” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard won: The Victorian Cross’s Priest and Handshake of World War I honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Viktorian Cross during the first world war, a soldier who has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Reverend Bernard Vann, who served as military colonel, received the cross on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
On the other hand, a sniper killed him four days later, and he was never told that he had been given the British Army’s highest vow.
His two grandsons exposed a monument about him during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
His grandson, Michael Vann, said that it was “deservedly symbolic ” that the memorial was exposed exactly 100 years from his grandfather’s honor.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his troops over the Canal de Saint-Quentin channel “through a very thick fog and under severe gun - and - gun shooting. ”
Later, he ran to the fireline, and with “great courage, ” he led the line forward before attacking one cannon and defeated three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, only a month before the war ended, a winner was killed by a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather’s heroic attitudes were “what I could never do, but something that makes you humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a flower crane after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he is “a great honor to participate in the parade, ” adding that“ the love of a true hero is shown with the support that so many show. ”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got to see Gurru pig.
Just imagine, having woke up all night to see overfull Bellator 206, just to be denied to see the main event.
The program had 13 battles from San Jose, six of them on the main program, and they were displayed in direct broadcast all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British audiences were surprised when the broadcast changed to Gurru pig.
Some were dissatisfied after being awake all night to watch the battle.
One fan of Twitter described the switch to the child - subject as “any kind of sick joke. ”
“ According to official rules, the subject was not suited for the audience at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s drugs, ” said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of the Marketing and Communication for Bellator, when he was asked to broadcast.
"Gurra pig, yes."
Scott Coker, director of Bellator said they'd review their time plans and take the viewers in Britain into account in the future.
"I think when I think of the reshow that we could probably solve this," said Coker.
“ But there is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday, and we can’t solve this until Sunday to our time, which is Monday with them.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a number of text messages were sent back and forth, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was an official problem.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We restrict the evening to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and passed out.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “difficulty ” due to sexual implications
Tom Daley, an ophthalmist, claims to have experienced incapacity toward other people in their upbringing because of their sexuality, but it encouraged him to succeed.
The 24 - year - old Daley said that he did not realize that “he was different from others ” until he went to high school. ”
In the radio program Desert Island Discs on Radio Four Channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said that he spoke of the rights of homosexuals to give “hope. ”
He also said that his parental role reduced his interest in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the ordinary participant, has taken a few months off from sickness.
When Daley was a child, he felt that he was “a lesser man ” because“ it was not agreed in society to love both boys and girls. ”
“ Until today, ” he said, “they feel that I am less than I am, and otherwise give me the strength and strength to succeed, ” he said.
He wanted to prove that he was “nothing, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint any when he was finally exposed to his sexuality.
As a supporter of LGBT, the double Olympic Bronze Sea used its participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said that he was being heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give “a hope. ”
The world champion three times said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, who he first met in 2013, “was surprised. ”
Daley married the 20 - year - old Oscar prize winner last year but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
“ When you’re going through so much when you’re young, ” but he participated in his first Olympic play and his father died of cancer three years later — he said that it was difficult to find a mate who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that “all his lifestyles ” had been cultivated.
“ If you had asked me last year, ” he said, “it was all about winning a gold prize. ”
“ You know, there are more important things than a gold prize at the Olympic Games.
Robbie is my Olympic Gold Prize."
His son is baptized in the head of his father Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years old, after diagnosing brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he had asked was if they had had their tickets before London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“ I couldn’t say to him that he would not live long enough to sit in the front row, ” he said.
“ I held his hand when he stopped breathing, ” he said, “and it was not until his breath stopped, and he was given that I finally acknowledged that he was not invincible. ”
Next year, Daley competed in the Olympic Games in 2012 and won a bronze prize.
“ All I knew was that I had dreamed of this all my life, dipping in front of the audience in the Olympic Games, ” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first layer - Proud by Heather Small - which had inspired him to the Olympic Games and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 p.m. to British local time.
Mickelson in bad shape and left on the bench in the Ryder cup on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson will beat the score on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder cup, but he needs to find back his old beats so that the assessment is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays at the 12th prize, was placed on the class after the decision of the leader Jim Furyk for the four-ball and four-play races on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has been so often before the United States, the day is divided by the five - double champion between being cheerleaders and practicing the plays of the field in hopes of correcting his problems.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot with the bastard, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National Golf, where long bumps often punish for bad shots.
And not only is the golf field a great challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, the winner of British Open, in the nineth Sunday game. Molinari is with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood in the team and together they have won all their four games this week.
If the U.S., who are four points below when they take the first game of 12 single games, they get a good start, the game of Mickelson could have made a difference.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much else.
“ He fully understood the role he had today, clapped my back, took his arms around me, and said that he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
“ He has a lot of confidence.
He's in the palace of celebrity, and he's been so great a remedy before and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I envisioned more, but this ended, and we thought that we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will score Nick Fallo in the number of games played in the Ryder cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the process in the Ryder cup that has never reached quite as high as other achievements on his file.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and 7 accords, but Fury said that his presence had a certain vague influence on the team.
“ He’s funny, he’s sarcasm, he’s funny, he’s enjoying making fun of people, and it’s great to have him in the joint room, ” he explained.
“ I think the younger players liked to tease him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game."
Thomas Bjorn, Head of Europe, knows that great advances can quickly disappear.
The European Chairman Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good precedent for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder cup can easily change into unpleasant experience.
The dance first played in Valderrama in 1997, where by side under the command of Seve Ballesteros, the United States had five points ahead, but it was just about to press out victory at the end with the least possible score difference, with 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
“We constantly remember that we had a great predecessor in Valderrama, we had a great predecessor in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we worked, but only just so,” said Bjorn, who is seen here in the picture, after watching the 2018 course work 5-3 both on Friday and Saturday and reach the forefront of 10-6 at the Le Golf National Field.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that it's not over.
We'll make every effort tomorrow.
Let's go do everything right.
This is not over until all the scores are on the table.
We have our goals and it's trying to win this cup, we focus on it.
I've always said this, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're very aware of our opposers in the other team - the best golfer in the world."
The bear was thrilled at how his players had done their hard work, adding: “I never get beyond myself in this.
Tomorrow day will be different.
Tomorrow it is the individual’s performance that matters, and that’s another thing.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you play one, you're trying every man's talent as a golfer.
That's the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he also has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his adversary, Jim Furyk, will endeavour to make his players better in individual games than with partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this major change on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline, but he ended up losing when Europe performed “the miracle in Medinah. ”
“ I remember every fucking word, ” he asked how Ben Crenshaw, the leader of 1999, had encouraged his players before the last day.
“ We have 12 important games to play tomorrow, but you want to start fast as you did at Brookline and Medinah.
When this crawl comes up, it causes a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We ordered our players according to that and let them play like we think it's going to work best tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and playing against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
“I chose these players in this order because I think they're going all the way through, ” said Bjorn about his choice of players in the individual competition.
New German Army Ship Deferred Again
The newest ships of the German Navy should have been built in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold war period, but it will not be ready until first of all next year because of broken systems and increasing costs, according to news in the area.
Based on the “Rheinland-Pfalz, ” the leadership of the new military ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the records of the military spoke to Die Zeit magazine.
The ship was supposed to be used by the Naval Army in 2014, but serious problems after delivery caused the project.
The four of the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the Bremen armed ships, which have come to their ages.
They should be equipped with a stronger cannon, a lot of air-defense and ship-defense missiles and feline technology such as reduced radar-infrared, and sound signals.
Other important characteristics are longer use time - the latest ships should be able to use for up to two years away from their home ports.
On the other hand, constant delays mean that these last-type warships - which are said to enable Germany to demonstrate its strength on the sea - are already obsolete when they are finally taken into use, says Die Zeit.
The F125 military ship came to the news last year when the German army officially refused to take over the flight and returned it to the Blohm & Voss drop in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
The reasons behind the divorce were little known, but German media spoke of many women who were seriously “deficient in software and machinery ” that made the ship useless if it was sent to a campaign.
Deficiencies in software were particularly important, because ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by 120 crews, which are half less than those of Bremen armed ships.
It also showed that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting its capacity to improve it in the future.
The 7000 tons of ships “Rheinland-Pfalz ” is thought to be twice the weight of ships in a similar category used by Germany during World War II.
Apart from engineering defects, the cost of all the project - including the training of the crew - is beginning to cause problems.
It is said to have reached EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), originally EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems affecting the latest ships are particularly important in view of the warnings that German superiority is decreasing outside.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Senate Defense Committee, acknowledged that the Navy was actually becoming “dissolved by a functioning ship. ”
The inspector said that the problem had occurred over time, for older ships were dismantled, but no ships replaced them.
He regretted that none of the orders of Baden-Wuerttemberg group could be used by the Navy.
National Trust Natural Protection Association spying on the secret life of bats
A new study carried out in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the landscape when they fish for food.
It is hoped that the results will be a new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help guide future natural protection measures.
The study conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland National Protection Association will monitor different types of bats in the Inverewe gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be installed in key locations around the area to monitor the behaviour of the bats over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be on monitoring trips with handheld sensors.
Experts will record all recordings to determine the frequency of the fladders and what species do what.
Maps of habitats and reports will then be published to produce a precise picture of their behaviour on a geographic scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS NTS - advisor, hopes that the results will reveal what kind of habitats are most important for the bats and how they are used for each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of management of habitats, e.g. by creating land and how best to maintain forests for flaps and other related species.
In the last century, in Scotland and throughout Britain, bats have declined considerably.
They are at risk because of construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and lights can also cause risks, including flying paper, and certain chemical treatments on building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, the ears are much more helpful than the eyes when it comes to catching a prey, because they are used to fishing at night.
They used highly developed electric engineering techniques to find insects and items on their flight.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land, takes bats very seriously.
Ten regular check - out experts work in the associations, including nest inspections, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even established the first and one country of bats in Scotland at the Threave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland’s ten fleet species have a home.
David Thompson, the farm manager, says he is a perfect area for them.
“ The place here at Threave is great for bats, ” he said.
“ We have old buildings, plenty of grown trees, and plenty of good habitats.
But there's still a lot of unaware of bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of checking for flaps before maintaining residences, where possible unintentional destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 female leaf flakes and young people and destroy all bats in the region.
Bats are protected, and it is forbidden to kill, harass, or disrupt, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about bats, and we don’t know how well many of their species are doing. ”
Ronaldo denies the charge of rape when lawyers prepare for a prosecution against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has accused him of raping “false news, ” saying that people want to“ draw attention to themselves ” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The prosecutor of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is said that he paid her $37,000 after that for the silence of the incident, according to Der Spiegel's news on Friday.
Some hours after the accusations were published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, said in an Instagram Live video of 142 million of his followers that they were “false news. ”
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the world champion five times to the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," the player added a smile.
The lawyers of Ronaldos are prepared to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they have called “unacceptable publication of suspicions relating to privacy, ” according to Reuters news office.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would demand compensation for “sacredness of the same amount as the seriousness of the fraud, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years. ”
The reported incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and the casino in Las Vegas.
According to Ronaldo and Mayorga, after meeting in a nightclub, they went back to the room of the player, where he was supposed to have raped her into the rectum, according to documents put before the Clark County County in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the injurious incident and told her that he was “99 percent good man ” who fell into temptation because of“ one percent. ”
The papers claim that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex, but that it was by consent.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries at a hospital, but finally agreed to settle outside the court because she was “fearing of revenge ” and was worried about being“ publicly devastated. ”
She now says she wants to cancel the treaty, for she is still in shock after a serious incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was supposed to take place, and this summer he went over to the Italian giant Juve with a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “be sorry forever ” to lose car manufacturers
Britain would “repent forever ” if it lost its position as the international leader of the car manufacturers of Brexit, says Mr. Greg Clark, Minister of Business.
He added that it was “anxiety” that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily discontinue its production in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit had no contract, the effect would be delayed by the border that reality would cost jobs.
The burnaston factory, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European countries.
“My opinion is that if Britain is running out of the EU by the end of March, we will see production stations in our factory, ” said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about the exit of the EU without agreement on how to carry out intergovernmental transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that his Mini factory will be closed in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that if Brexit becomes a reality, what the car manufacturers say is a prison chain risk.
Toyota production lines are based on the reception at the “last hour” where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from supplies both in Britain and in the EU for cars produced on orders.
If the United Kingdom retires without a contract on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the borders that industry considers could lead to delays and shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day store in his factory in Derbyshire, said the company, and therefore the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that the Chequers Theresu May programme for future relations with the EU “is specifically designed to prevent these views at the border. ”
“We have to have a deal, ” he said in a radio show at BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must continue with very successful catches.
Toyota could not tell how long their production would be stopped, but it warned that for a long time, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trustee of the Labour Society at the factory, said that his colleagues are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
The government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU. ”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
On Sunday, the White House declared that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, a state prosecutor, could be “frested again by one week, ” is now the dispute for Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Judge, continues.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor investigating Russian elections, links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice by the President.
For weeks, reports have been reported in Washington on whether Trump will run the Assistant Prosecutor and thus jeopardise Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed carrying a recording device to record a conversation with Trump and the possibility of choosing the president by using the 25th additional paragraph of the Constitution.
Rosenstein refused these claims.
The last Monday, however, he visited the White House, among the news that he was going to quit.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he was “preferably not ” to run Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to not be at the same time as the hearing of the Senate Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who have prosecuted him for sexual affairs, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote of the Senate.
Sarah Sander, media officer of Trump, was on a broadcast on Fox News Sunday.
When asked to meet with Rosenstein, she said: “It may be this week that he may be postponed by another week because of everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and it's always my pleasure to inform the media."
Some journalists disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
The director Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not due to dissatisfaction because TV newsmen had “showmanship, ” but she said:“ I’m not disagreed with the fact that they have a showmanship. ”
She then indicated that a direct relationship between Trumps and the media would increase.
“ The president answers more questions from the media than any other president has done before, ” she said, without quoting sources: “We have reviewed these figures. ”
“ If the media have the opportunity to ask the United States President directly, it is much better than talking to me, ” Sanders said.
We're trying to do a lot of it, and you've seen us do a lot of it in the last few weeks and it's gonna replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Press meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have indicated why he was in New York this week, when he showed unrestricted and in times of strange behavior in front of a group of journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU healthcare professionals in Scotland due to concern for Brexit
The Health Minister has written to EU staff working within the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express their appreciation and wish that they continue to work after Brexit has passed through.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter when less than six months are past until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the costs of applications for employment permits for EU citizens working in the public service sector.
Miss Freeman wrote in his letter: “Over the summer, discussions between Britain and the European Union have continued and is expected to take decisions in the autumn.
The British Government has also worked to prepare if a contract is not possible.
I know this must be a great time of uncertainty for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the work of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and elsewhere provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a headache
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after having had a head trauma in 31-27 losses against the team Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to a report by Mike Organ, Tennessean journalist.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told journalists that the trauma was shortly before half-playing.
“He came to the sideline and fell down there, ” Reed said.
Coachs and medical officers gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before being placed on bars and carried out for further examination.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris, a radioman of WSMV, Nashville, Tennesse, that Abercrombie had done surgery at the Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there was “no information or seriousness of the impact yet ” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, in the final year of school, plays its first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five capacities at all on Saturday before he left, which increased the total number of capacities in him up to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged for higher plunger fees when buying properties in Britain
Foreign purchasers will be charged with higher stamp fees when buying properties in Britain.
The operation will destroy the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased plunger fees will be paid to those who do not pay taxes in Britain
A government fund estimates to earn 120 million pounds a year - to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp fees when they buy real estate in Britain, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless. Theresa May will report this today.
The operation will be considered an attempt to eradicate the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by promising accommodation at the affordable price and taxing high school members more.
Individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain have to pay higher stamp fees, and the surplus will go into the government's operations to help the homeless.
The increase - which is added to the current plunger fees, including the increase of two years ago in extra homes and property purchases for rent, could be up to three percent.
The government estimates that the increase will raise up to £ 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by foreigners, causing awards, making it more difficult for those who want to buy real estate for the first time to enter the market.
Many wealthy areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become “drama towns ” because of the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in plunger fees to help more young people to have their first home.
He accused large building firms to keep property high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to cancel the quota in households at the affordable price to fix the “household ” of Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of considerate improvements in housing matters, including rent ceilings and the end of the non-compliance of rentals.
He also wants to give more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that I would sanctify myself to the restoration of the British dream during my first season — that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And this involves fixing our ruined real estate market.
The door of Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for foreigners as for companies with foreign headquarters to buy homes and for hardworking British residents.
For many the dream of their own dwelling has become far too far away, and the shame of their homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland ”
Jack Ross, Sunderland coach, says that it is his “primary goal ” to ever become a Scotland trainer.
This 42-year-old Scott now enjoys the challenge of blowing up a new life in the North-East Club now in the third place in the first division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after having returned to St. Mirren in the Scottish Excellence Department during the last season.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I got hurt on my knee, and so it was done," said Ross in an interview with Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there is always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be given if I did well to train a department team."
The executives of Ross as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of the Alloa Athletic Club said that he felt no fear of following in the footsteps of such famous names in such a large club, but he had previously rejected training stations at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ As I am, I will measure my success by thinking: “Can I bring this club back to the elite department? ”
This club certainly belongs to the excellent department because of his structure and condition," he said.
“ It’s not easy to get him there, but I’d probably only think of me as a success here if I brought the club back up there. ”
Ross has only three years of experience as a trainer after a period as a coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a training team for Hearts.
He helped Alloa to recover from falling into the third division, and St. Mirren, who was in the process of falling over a department, converted the championship to the next season.
Ross says he's more confident now than he ever was in his actress at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“ This was probably a real coincidence, ” he says during the period when he became Alloa’s trainer.
“ I really believed that my training work suited me even more than to play.
It sounds strange, because I did well; I had good profits from it, and had good success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I still experience stress and pressure from my job, but the training work seems just right for me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do it; I have never felt better with myself in all my adult years."
The entire interview can be listened to in the Sportsound show on Sunday, September 30 at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 at the British local time.
The best time for beer is 5:30 a.m. on Saturdays, according to a survey.
The heat wave this summer has proved profitable for a British bar in trouble, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, the sales of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but the sales at restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA Business Advisor, who compiled the figures, said: “The future sunshine and unexpected success of England in the world cup meant that July followed a similar pattern and a June month when barsale increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants selling even less.
The sale fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
Pops and bars, mostly for the sale of drinks, did the best of them with a greater fluctuation while restaurants went downward.
The sun was also difficult to sell, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
Sales of beverages in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent before the month, but food sales fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM analysis company, said: “The results are continued on the fluctuation we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social events or sports events are still the main factors when it comes to the sale of markets outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still in trouble, although a reduction in sales to 4.8 percent between months is particularly painful above continued pressure from expenses.
This long and hot summer could hardly come in a worse time for restaurants and only the time will show whether the temperature we've had in August will improve the situation."
In July, total growth in the sale of pops and restaurants, including in newly opened locations, reflected 2.7 percent of the openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the surveillance company with sales in the British bar and restaurant store, collects and analyses data from 47 business groups, with a total of 9 billion pounds and is the industrial industry.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children, up to 11 years of age, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the results of a survey.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in the ‘positive Insta’ page
News has increased the concern that sexual material is published
Twenty percent of students claim to have a “primary ” account that they show to parents
One in five children, up to 11 years of age, make secret accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a significant increase in the “Gervi Insta” account, which refers to the Instagram website.
The news has increased the concern about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a pure “primary ” account to show parents, while keeping secret accounts.
One mother, who fell down on her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website, found a youth who encouraged others to “ rape me. ”
The study by Digital Awareness UK and the private school manager (HMC) showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two accounts, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of the HMC, said: “It’s anxious that so many youths are tempted to create an area on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletics ” of the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as an officer without a mandate at the annual general meeting of the government.
Doyle, the most successful free athlete of Scotland, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the Committee, said that the appointment was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from its great international experience in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in sports communities in Scotland, Britain, and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money to get them in the committee, ” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of sportsmen, hoping that I can contribute and help to lead the sport forward in Scotland. ”
The American, who worked among the ananrs 200 meters and 400 meters of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, with a total of four Olympic golds, and is now a regular guest at BBC, was paralyzed after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “Just a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would reveal whether I recovered or how much.
This has been a hard job, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and practice sports today!
Thank you for your encouragement!"
A breast pump advertisement comparing mothers with cows causes network disparities
A company that produces breast pumps is now discussed on the Internet because of advertisements carrying lactating mothers to milked cows.
The company Elvie published a smart advertisement to mark a presentation of what is said to be “the first quiet breast pumps in the world that can be carried out outside, ” inspired by music videos, and to show the freedom of the new pump to breast - feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows with a song like: “Yes, I milk me, but you see no tail on me ” and “If you didn’t notice it, it’s not junk but my breasts. ”
The appendix continues: “Push, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk out of the wools. ”
However, the advertisement appearing on the company's Facebook website has led to online publicity.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has had a different reaction from the audience, many saying that it is gantting with the “hry ” that accompanys the milk industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
As we do, they have to be calfful and bear to produce milk, unless the calves are taken away from them only a few days after they are born," said one of the words.
Elvie breast pump fits conveniently in a breast-feeding holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another spectator wrote: “Absolutely hard for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of line with time. ”
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman acknowledged that the song was “extremely funny. ”
“ I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have bought this if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one of the audience.
Another said: “This is a fun advertisement directed to mothers who pump milk (often at work or inside a toilet) and feel like “cool. ”
This is not an advertisement that commends or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the ad, the female group shows that they were all dancing with their breast pumps hidden in their breast hoods.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is that many women say that they feel like cows when pumping milk out.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or pipes, and fits conveniently into a breast - holder that allows women to move, holds their child and even goes out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a co - owner and head of Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that she deserved a prominent presentation that would raise publicity.
By impressing women with cows, we wanted to direct the headlight to breast pumping and all of her challenges, and even show in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would give.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump's come to the news.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children presented a fashion show for the designer Martha Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to camp near the border of Texas
The number of immigrant children in custody has suddenly increased even though the number of crossing the border has remained almost the same in a month, and the part of the reason is that hard talks and policies presented by Trump’s government have made it more difficult to get their children into a temporary fetus.
Usually, fetal parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and have feared to put their chances of staying in the country at risk, by offering themselves to foster a child.
In June, when government officials announced that potential foetal parents and other adults in the home had to provide fingerprints, the data would be shared by the Immigrant Surveillance Authority.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the commander of the immigration and customs authorities, witnessed before the Senate and said that his agency had arrested a number of people who applied to foster single children.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on a criminal record.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in the home of fostering children are illegal in the country, and much of them are illegal immigrants.
“So we continue to search for those individuals, ” said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to resolve children’s situation more quickly, representatives announced new rules requiring some children to appear in a courtroom within a month of their imprisonment, rather than after 60 days of the previous course, according to staff working in the event.
Many of them will be present through a video conference, rather than personally, to give evidence of their legal position before a judge in immigration matters.
The children who are sentenced unfit to enter the country are quickly sent out of the country.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or refugee attempts, according to the residents and reports published by the system during the past months.
Speakers said that these problems were even more likely to be found in a larger organization, such as in Tornillo, where it is likely that no one will notice that a child has a hard time because of the number of them.
They added that the transfer of children to the tent city without giving enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say goodbye to friends may increase the shock already faced by many of them.
Syria tells the United States, France, and Turkey to retreat immediately
Walid al-Moualem, Foreign Minister, also said in his speech at the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Vice Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were illegal in Syria, under the false precondition that they oppose terrorism, and “they will be dealt with accordingly. ”
“ They must retreat immediately and without any conditions, ” he said to the Senate.
Moualem firmly argued that “the war against terrorism was almost over ” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to carry on this holy struggle until we cleanse all Syrian areas“ of both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreigners. ”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, where most of them train and advise both Curdish troops and Syrian araeans who fight against the President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war - stricken country.
As for refugees, Moualem said that circumstances are good enough for them to return, and he taught “some Western countries ” to“ spread out unreasonable fear ” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“ We have called upon an international community and a human society to facilitate their return, ” he said.
“They create politics from something that should be mere humanism. ”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for rebuilding in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the Resistance to end the war.
The U.S. Government states that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area in the last major resistance fortress has given the opportunity to continue political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented heavy attacks from Syrian troops strengthened by the Russians, in the province of three million people.
Moualem, on the other hand, stressed that the contract had “a clear final time, ” declaring the hope that military action would be directed to the Jihadistum, including the Nusra Front fighters, who are connected with Al-Qaeda, and that they were“ desolated. ”
Staffan de Mistura, UN ambassador, hopes to be able to come to the first meeting with a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition, to make a constitution for Syria after the war and pay the streets for elections.
Moualem provided conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that her work should be limited to “considering the provisions of the current government,” and warned against all interventions.
The reasons for Trump will win another election period
According to that reasoning, Mr. Trump would win the re-elections in 2020, unless the accusation and scandal end his presidential career, as many liberal audiences are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of the presidential career ever! ”
At present, the audience has no fatigue marks.
Since 2014, the best time views have doubled up to 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time, which is an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and a feature of MSNBC, The Rachel Maddow Show, has reached the top of the view of up to 3.5 million viewers on important news evenings.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to because this is something we don’t understand, ” said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama shows “Designated Survivor” on a government official who will become president after the Senate has been destroyed.
Nell Scovell, experienced writer and writer of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another hypothesis.
She remembers a trip to a cab in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he was going to choose Mr. Trump.
She asked.
“He said, “Because he makes me laugh, ” said Miss Scovell to me.
There's a value of entertainment in the wreck.
Unlike TV, however, Washington’s stories could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can unite and the health of the international economy.
Only the audience who enjoys the greatest privilege can afford to stop watching.
And yet this is more than being an enlightened citizen when you look at the sixth time in a group of experts reasoning the use of Bob Woodwards on “deeply - intimate ” sources for their book “Fears, ” or 15,000 - dollars struts jacket that Paul Manafort wore (“a cloth that is born with pride, ” said Washington Post) and the consequences of the exact biological descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump.
At least I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“Apart from what he does, it makes you feel like a reality show, that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the "Pawn Stars" shows when he discussed the worker’s performance in Trump’s show and daily changes in the history threads (e.g. starting a fight with N.F.L. and commendation to Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one factor, or you'll lose the wire.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, there was a temperature of 26 degrees and sunlight outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed inside and watched MSNB while he picked up CNN.
He could not break himself away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the judicial committee of the Senate, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were making all these crazy scenes in old times, and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization, ” said Mr. Fleiss to me.
“ I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that people were right. ”

Money beyond flow during the nearest mid-term elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th choice area sees the money flowing to itself, thanks to the reorganization of choice areas that led to two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area sends forth the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another choice area in the last summer.
Lamb presents himself against another representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, now representing the old 12th ideal area in Pennsylvania, which is much in line with the new 17th region.
The maps of selection were reorganized after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court decided in January that the old areas were organized in the interests of the Republics and that it would violate the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th choice area has been the beginning of a competition in the financing of election campaigns between the main financial partners of both categories, the Democratic Committee on Vocational Affairs (DCCC) and the NRCC.
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in the special elections in March before the 18th choice area in Pennsylvania, many watched the elections.
The Republicans had previously warmed it for over a decade, and Donald Trump, President of the Republic, won a victory in the field of choice with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little advance.
The United States thought about punishing El Salvador for the support of China, but then resigned.
The Empire noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing, with little protests from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017, and stayed at a Panaman hotel until the members of the Trump company were expelled.
Deputies of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back the U.S. ambassador of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of “a new decision not to accept the Taiwan no longer, ” said Heather Nauert, the minister’s spokesman in early this month.
However, punishment was considered only against El Salvador, estimated to have received $ 140 million from the United States for aid in 2017, including drug monitoring, development and economic support.
The penalties imposed, including reductions in financial support and restrictions on the release of residence, would have been painful for the Central American country, with high unemployment and high mortality.
As the meetings continued, the U.S. and Central American representatives postponed a conference on security and economic success and were to follow a similar meeting that was held last year and considered to be a step forward in action to prevent people from moving to the United States.
By mid - September, however, representatives from the top made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus ending all the question of punishment against El Salvador.
Mr. Mike Pence, Vice President, is now addressing the conference to be held in the middle of October as a symbol of the importance of it in the eyes of the government, said the Ambassadors.
The three U.S. a. a. a.m. returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard message or punishment from Washington.
The spokesman of the White House for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss the discussions described by the three American representatives, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the domestic discussions against being anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the government and also spoke about the matter against anonymity.
Learning the History
The next scandalous case might be Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, report on the possible actions of Mr Trump to prevent justice, but for that accusation there are numerous public evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller also turns his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's election campaign was working with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Senate is governed by another class, Trump may have to be responsible for it, at the time he prepares to meet his voters again, and perhaps his boulder sentence appointed to his peers.
However, this is extremely uncertain and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trumps is unequivocal, nor the fall of his colleague in Europe.
We all have to choose, both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the length of the battle.
In 1938, German governments were prepared to rob Hitler of power, only if the Western countries had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed to do so and lost the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of disaster.
History is about such important points and speeds or delays for the unstoppable progress of democracy.
Americans are faced with some such important points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump runs Mr. Rod Rosenstein's prosecutor, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's research?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he had proposed to make secret recordings of the president, discussing whether he was incapacitated in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is wrong.
“ How will we react if the newly requested FBI study at Brett Kavanaugh is not detailed or reasonable, or if it is confirmed in the seat of Supreme Court judge despite the likely accusations of sexual ambiguity and dishonest witness?
And above all, will we vote for a council in the middle period that will make Mr. Trump shoulder responsibility?
If we fall on these tests, the democracy will have to last long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother, a Jew from Czechoslovakia, was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government and was formerly in my ambassador residence.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the chross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not look positively at our future?"

Graham Dorrans, Rangers' team, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will make them in a strong position to get out of the G Group of the European Union.
Injury on the knee prevented the center guard Graham Dorrans from playing his first game in the season until the game against Villareal ended with 2-2 equals, but he believes that Rangers can use the finals as a jumpboard for better success.
“ It was good to have this score for us, for the wild realm is a strong team, ” said Dorran, 31 years old.
“ We started the game in the belief that we could achieve something and ended up with one point.
Perhaps we could have squeezed victory at the end, but as a whole, equal was probably a fair final.
They were probably better at the first half game, and we got strong in the second half game and played better.
Thursday is another important night for the European Department.
Hopefully we can achieve three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they did well in their last game, but with the audience who supports us, I'm sure we're going to make this work and get a positive final.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that happened in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling in the area.
The team is good and the boys enjoy themselves, the training is good.
Hope we can move further now, put the last season behind us and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing retirement savings
Although participants in the poll had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said that they discussed the cost of long - term care with their mate.
Only 10 percent claimed to discuss this with their children.
“People want a family member to care for it, ” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Department.
That's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family for caring if you do not make your wishes clear with good advances.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you are being cared for, for these options can change much in terms of expenses.
Get your financial counselor involved: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays in cash, to help pay expenses, or self-security with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: prevent legal differences in advance.
Get a health care officer so that you can appoint someone you trust to supervise your health care and ensure that your healthcare professionals respond to your requests if you cannot express them directly yourself.
Consider, too, to get a practicor for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your accounts are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is on the way to a hospital in an emergency situation.
Could you answer questions about medicines and hypersensitivity?
Please provide this information exactly in a written schedule so that you are ready.
“ It’s not just about the money, but also about who the doctors are, ” Martin said.
“ What are the medicines?
Who will look after the dog?
Keep that plan ready."

Earthquakes and Flood waves in Indonesia
At least 384 died after a powerful earthquake and flood wave in the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, said representatives, and the number of the dead is expected to rise.
Since all communications are downstairs, aid workers have not been able to provide any information from Donggala County, a region north of Palu, near the center of the earthquake of 7.5 on Richter.
More than 16,000 people were left in Pala after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region and is located at the bottom of a narrow flea on the west coast of the island Sulawesi. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379.800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40 - year - old birthday when the earthquake and the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a region that covers more than 380 miles [380 km] of a coastline in the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The government sector under the province had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sectors of the Central-Sulawes region, especially in Donggala’s coastal areas.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, most of which are in Morowali, which is on the coast against Sulawesi.
Flood waves have swelled in Palu and Donggala several times in the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Institute.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when a wave of floods hit and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
In 1996, the west part of Donggala, with nine deaths, would also be flooded.
Indonesia sits on the active ring of the Pacific fire, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the main earthquakes and flood waves of recent years:
2004: A great earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh region in the north of Sumatra began on December 26, and a flood of 14 lands, killing 226,000 people across the Indian coastline, of which over half was in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong tremors crossed the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds die on the island of Nia, from the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake of 6.8 on Richter crossed southern Java, the largest island of Indonesia, causing a flood that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A earthquake of 7.6 on Richter crossed near Padang, a capital city in the western part of Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A earthquake of 7.5 on Richter crossed one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, and raised up up to 10 meters [10 m] high flood waves that destroyed many villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: The Pidie Jaya County of Aceh, a basic earthquake, caused destruction and horror when people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquakes and flood waves in 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but over 100 died when buildings collapsed.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, is greatly shaken, and more than 500 people died, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stuck on the island.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for the charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and presidential candidate, has been arrested for a charge of physical assault.
The 29 - year - old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for attempting to prevent domestic violence and oppose arrest, according to a report from the Alaska State Police, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone off of her friend when she tried to call the police to report a suspected crime.
The Palin is held at the Mat-Su Station where he's waiting for judgment, and he's held against $500 insurance, according to a report from the KTUU.
On Saturday, he was convicted of being “not guilty, firm, ” when he was asked to declare guilty or innocent, according to the news station.
The Palin is accused of three felony in Class A, which means that he could be sentenced to prison for up to one year and has to pay a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of a crime in Class B, which is punishable with one day in prison and a fine of $2000.
This isn't the first time Palin's been accused.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is now being dealt with by the Alaskan Emergency Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, for preventing domestic violence, and for carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in the event.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of surrender soldiers in 2016 after she taught a shocking attack on her son’s violent behavior, after his military service in Iraq.
An earthquake and a wave of floods in Indonesia: hundreds of dead,
At least 384 people died after an earthquake crossed the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 on Richter triggered a flood wave and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems are below and the number of dead are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake was just in the middle of the Sulawesi Island, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show when the incident came to pass on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a coastal festival in the city of Pala when the flood wave hit the beach.
Prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
New York Prosecutors want a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect of being involved in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people.
Saipov, 30 years old, is thought to have taken a Home Depot truck rented to attack people on a bicycle trail along the street of West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan, driving down walking and wheeling road users in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “due for purpose ” and caused serious physical injuries“ deliberately, ” according to the deliberate declaration of the death penalty recorded in the Southern State Judgment in New York.
Both of these prosecutors can lead to possible death penalty, according to the legal document.
Many weeks after the attack, Saipov’s federal judgment accused in 22 teams, including eight charges for murder for criminal purposes, which are usually used by prosecutors in charge of organized crime organisations, and Saipov was also accused of violence and for destroying the car.
The attack included “speakingly planned programming, ” prosecutors described the action of Sapiov as“ horrible, cruel, and immoral. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused physical harm, harm and loss to families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, ” says the wild statement.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade ago, in the southern part of New York, the last case of death was for treatment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, who were eventually sentenced in a lifetime prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a New York court case in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married couples who were executed after being condemned for spying for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both of them were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of repentance during the days and months after the attack, according to legal records.
He said to an investigator that he was comfortable with what he had done, says a policeman.
Saipov told the authorities that he had the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, as stated in the charge.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 points of the charge.
David Patton, one of the official defenders of Saipov, said that they were “deliberately disappointed ” by the decision of the accused.
“We believe that the decision to ask for death penalty instead of accepting a guilt declaration against life-time prison without the possibility of a trial solution, will only prolong the shock due to this event for all the shareholders, ” Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked a prosecutor not to seek death penalty.
Congressman says that NIGEL FARAGE should conduct negotiations for Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “activate the people’s army ” today in protests at the Conservatives’ Conference.
This former leader, Ukip, said that politicians must “feel pressure” from doubters about the European Union at the same time as one of the Congressmen of Theresu May suggested that he conduct the negotiations with the EU.
Conservator Peter Bone said in Birmingham’s protest march that Britain “was gone out ” now if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit.
However, the challenge that May faces to reconcile a deep conflict between her own teams was even more evident when the conservatives who want to remain in the EU participated in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulties in keeping his Chequer's plan in the right direction and is subject to criticism from those who support Brexit, those who are opposed, and the EU.
Allies claimed that she will continue to make a deal with Brussels despite opposition and forcing those who oppose Brexit and the Workers team to choose between its plan and “inconvenience. ”
Mr. Bone said to Leave Means Leave the Voyage in Solihull that he wanted to “sleep off the Chequers plan. ”
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have participated and shoulder responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we would have gone out now, ” he said.
The senator from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers plan. ”
He explained his opposition to the EU: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone pointed out that the opinion of the public had changed from the 2016 elections: “The idea that the British public changed their minds and wants to remain is completely false. ”
Andrea Jenkyn, a conservative supporter of Brexit, also said to journalists: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is impotent among the public, and the opposition will not vote with it, and it enjoys the impopulations of our classmen and activists who are on the streets and vote for us.
Please stop Chequer's plan and start listening."
In direct messages to May, she added: “Presidents keep the job when they fulfill their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said that the politicians had to “feel pressure ” if they were to defraud from the decision taken after the 2016 vote.
“ This is now about trust between us — our people and our political party, ” he said.
“ They want to try to betray Brexit, and we are here today to say to them, “We will not let you get away with this. ”
He added in his messages to the crowd: “I want you to let your political party, who is in betraying Brexit, experience pressure.
We act as an army of the public in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-controlling, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest march in Birmingham, which concluded with a two-hour protest meeting in the city.
A small group of activists waved the flag of the conservators against Brexit after the group was set up during the weekend.
Lord Adonis, from the Workers Team, made fun of conservatives because of security problems that occurred in the class’s phone program when the conference was opened.
“ This is the people who tell us that they can have all computer systems and all technology for Canada plus, for borders without obstacles, for free trade with Ireland without borders, ” he added.
“ This is a total scandal.
There is nothing that can be called good Brexit," he said.
Warren intends to “eagerly consider ” to present himself to the presidential office.
After the elections in November, Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. Senator, says that he is going to “eagerly consider the presentation of the presidential office. ”
In a report from Boston Globe, the Democrat from Massachusetts discussed his future at a civil meeting in the west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has rarely criticized President Donald Trump of the United States, volunteers for re-elections in November against the Republic of Geoff Diehl, co-ordinated in Trump’s campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.

One attendant at the meeting asked her if she was planning to volunteer for a president.
Warren replied that it would be time for “women to go to Washington and control our government, and then a woman must also be a leader. ”

The Baton Rouge police announced arrest at Dyteon Simpson, 20 at a news meeting at 11 a.m.
On Friday, she had previously published a video of the shooting attack and asked for help to identify a man who was seen on the recording.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near the Southern University district early on Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died because of it, ” said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to the 247 sports report.
Wayde came to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.

The Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship title after Sebastian Vettel has given him the victory seat on their command.
It was evident from the fact that Valtteri Bottas sat in front of Lewis Hamilton before launch on Saturday, that orders from the Mercedes team would play a big part in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost left Hamilton behind when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to fight against his teammate.
Vettel first went to the pit and let Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, which should have been the ultimate.
The Mercedes car went to the pit one ring later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came out after a short conflict where Ferrari’s driver was forced to leave the inner side after having had the risk of being left, after the third turn attempts.
Max Verstappen began in the back of the group and was in the seventh seat at the end of the first round, on his 21 - year birthday.
He then led the majority of the race when he delayed switching tires to try to finish quickly and cross Kimi Raikkonen and reach the fourth seat.
Finally, he went to the pit in a 44rd circle but could not increase the speed of the remaining eight circles, and Raikkonen took the fourth seat.
This is a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman to let me get ahead.
The team has done a marvelous job to achieve this," Hamilton said.
That was really a bad body-training thing.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein in a Saturday meeting because of her claim that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accused of Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Judge, on sexual interest.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but he did not directly discuss the testimony from Ford before the Senate Committee, instead of saying that what happened in the Senate showed that people were “bad and cruel and unfaithful. ”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful things that have been going on in the last days of the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and hurt and cruel and unfaithful, ” he said.
“ When you see the exhibits and the leaks and then say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you defeat this?
Remember her answer... did you defy the document - “Oh, what?
Oh, no.
So I didn't lie."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't lie down," he said, and impressed the Senate Senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the accusations from Ford against Kavanaugh were made, so early in September, Feinstein refused that the leak had come from her office.
“I did not hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I did not lay her story, ” said Feinstein to the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“ She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did what she asked me to do. ”
However, her denial seemed not to be very good at the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “Let me tell you, this was really bad body - training.
Maybe she didn't lie, but this was the worst body-training I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense for Brett Kavanaugh, accused of three women’s sexual accusation, suggesting that demokrats are taking advantage of the accusations.
“ They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods need to be used.
You see the cruelty, the badness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to choose to take over and rule," said the president, according to the mediaite report.

A pilot dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia has been welcomed as a hero after his death to ensure that hundreds of passengers can take up a whole plane.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a great earthquake rided over the island of Sulawesi on Friday and started a wave of flooding.
Large afterquakes continue to plague the area, and many are trapped under ruins in the city of Palu.
The 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his associates had fled the steering tower that swirled violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that the Batik Air plane number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake hit, could certainly be able to fly.
He then jumped out of the steering tower when he thought he was falling down.
He later died in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman of Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News, Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, California, to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“ We are very sad to hear this, ” he added.
The government fears that the number of the dead could exceed a thousand, when the National Disaster Institute says that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
“ It is estimated that the number of dead are still rising because many bodies are still under ruins and cannot be reached, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Institute.
Up to six feet [6 m] high waves have caused tremendous destruction in Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
The Army and passenger airplanes are working on delivering supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There's little clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to find survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it may go worse."
On Sunday, President Indonesia, Joko Widodo, said to the country’s army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all missions related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said in a report from CNN.
Earlier this year, in Indonesia, there were earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A micronesia air crash: Air Niugini now says that the same is missing after a plane crashed into a leon
The airline, which had a plane crashing into a leon in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, after having said that all 47 passengers and crews had escaped from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a announcement that from the afternoon on Saturday, it didn’t know about the restoration of one male passenger.
The airline said that it was working with the local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The boats in the area helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when she tried to land on the airport on the Chuuk Island.
On Friday, representatives said that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that all of them were stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and the exact order of the incidents.
The U.S. Airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane had landed in the zone just before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had gone too far across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the flight was very low.
“It was really good, ” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others could water down the water and reach emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots were frightened and shouting and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that seafarers at work at a distance from making up a dock also helped to save by using a blown - up boat to ship people to land before the plane sank in about 30 yards of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Agency show that 111 people have died in the flight accidents of the PNG registered aircraft in the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the evening when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors closed their proceedings on Saturday in a relocation case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Justice Department, was in the courtroom for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the court of the abdomen how he used mobile records to put together the journeys of 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett claimed to have received location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, according to the report from The Clarion Ledger.
When evidence showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
On Saturday, Sanford witnessed and said that he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said that it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only known for one week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers died, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and contact information from her phone.
“He destroyed her from his life, ” said Hale.
It is estimated that the defendants will deliver their final talk on Sunday.
The judge said he would expect the matter to be brought to court later that day.

Another black person?!
New York Nurses Appeal a couple for disfellowshipping after a “prejudicial ” text message
A nursing in New York lawsuits a couple for an improper expiration after she accidentally received a text message from her mother, complaining that she was “another black person. ”
The couple refuse to be prejudiced and liken the appeal to “courage. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned that her new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
“NEEEEEIIIII OTHER SWAT HUMAN, ” wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the messages to her husband, she sent them twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering her mistakes, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman said that their former miserable foetuses had done badly, and that she had expected to have a Philippan wife, according to a report from the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home in a Uber car.
Maurice now sues the couple and wants compensation for the disfellowshipping, that the amount of $ 350 a day for the six-month job she had originally been appointed, although no contract was signed.
“ I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do this, ” she said in an interview with Post on Friday and added: “I know that this is discrimination. ”
The couple have objected to the accusation that they are prejudiced and say that it was the right thing to fire Maurice, since they felt that they could not trust her after offending her.
“ My wife sent her a message that she wouldn’t say.
She's not prejudiced.
We are not prejudiced people, ” said the husband Joel Plasco to Post.
“ But who would trust their children after showing rudeness, even if it was accidental?
His newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco likened the appeal to “pressure, ” and said that his wife was seven months ahead and was in“ extreme situations. ”
“ Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It's not very nicely done," said Plasco, who works in the investment sector.
The case is still in the court, but the public have spoken harshly about the couple in the social media and embarrassed them for their conduct and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, says a new letter.
Regarding the letter, Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said: “It is difficult to follow someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
“ It’s very funny now that we know of Paddington’s tremendous success. ”
She said that her father, who worked as a photographer at the BBC before he was inspired to write a book of children about a small toy bear, had taken off his work with a calm positive attitude, adding that the 60th year of the book’s release was “a delightful wound ” after his death last year.
As for Paddington, which she describes as “a very important member of the family, ” she added that her father had been quietly proud of his success.
“He was a very quiet man and he was not used to pride himself, ” she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you had a child who accomplished something, and you are proud of it even though you did nothing for yourself.
I think he kind of looked at Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington himself the honor."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her through the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been moved to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything they could to save her life, but without success.
“ Naad called me regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she would not be expected to survive, ” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then Nad called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given by her by her doctors to sustain her heart rate were gradually losing their activity and excreted from her body.
She had died shortly before, and this was the body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing this was all happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her daughter, went on the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she experienced.
“No one knew anything, ” she said.
“ I drew my head, and my tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a lot of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Tragic Women Hanging Up Messages to Avoid Suicide on a Bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey have posted a message on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
A 13 - year - old son of Miss Davis, Tyler, began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
“ I don’t want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day, ” she said.
Miss Davis, 45 years old, lives in Lydney and says that her son was a successful cook with a contagious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up any room."
He stopped working before he died, for he was “sucked into a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, the 11 - year - old, found his brother dead after his own suicide.
Ms. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that it will be a success. ”
Miss Davis made the message “to let people know that you can go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don't sit and say nothing - you need to talk to someone."
Miss Humphrey, who has been a friend of Miss Davies for years, lost his spouse, Mark, to 15 years of age, shortly after his mother died.
“ He didn’t talk about feeling bad or being depressed, ” she said.
“ Some days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his temper.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look in their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a shock to them, but that they had to work themselves out: “It tears a hole in the family.
This will break us apart.
But we have to endure and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is hanging on a blue thread when the FBI has their investigation.
“ I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for — a study with limited time and scope — we might be able to get a little comfortable, ” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was ‘ breaking apart ’ in the middle of a conflict between the groups, where everything was in a retreat.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican party want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their patience is due to their timing.
The mid - period surveys are only five weeks, November 6, and if the republicans are going badly, as expected, their serious attempts to get their husband elected to sit in the Supreme Court of the country will weaken.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, but she was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes their research report?
A vote will be held at the Senate Assembly, where 51 Democrats and 49 Democrats are at present.
Mr. Kavanaugh may not yet be able to have at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but that would enable Mr. Mike Pence's Vice President to break up the level and confirm him in the office of the Supreme Court.
Number of people who flee North Korea “reduces ” under Kim’s rule
The number of those who flee from North Korea and go to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a congressman from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted data from the South Korea Confederation Council and said that 1127 people had escaped last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border alerts between North Korea and China and higher charges paid by smugglers with people were key elements.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those who flee North Korea are invited to have a South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, over 30,000 people from North Korea crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee to China, but it has the longest border to North Korea, and it is easier to cross them than the very neutral area between North and South Korea.
China views the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Communications between North and South Korea, which are still in war, technically speaking, have improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions mainly about delayed nuclear decommissioning negotiations.
This was after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and President Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together towards a nuclear-free Korean cave.
On Saturday, however, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, instructed US traders about the lack of progress since then.
“ Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the safety of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons once, ” said Ri in his speech at the General Assembly of the United States of New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “Mother Disease ” and says he is incapable of the work of Supreme Court Judge
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority, called Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Judge “Mother Disease, ” and said he was too temperate to be able to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi put these words at an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“ I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever acted like that, she would have been called hysterical, ” Pelosi said about his reaction to the witness of Kavanaugh to the Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied with a deep sense of accusation that he had offended Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening talk, and sometimes he shouted, and when he talked about his family and school years, he got a cake in his throat.
He also officially condemned demokrats in the Committee and called the accusations against him “an alarming and organized reputation ” that were organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was partial to the Democrats.
“I think these claims and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is incapable of the job, ” she said.
Pelosi did not answer when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh out of work if he was confirmed and if the majority of the Democrats were reached in the Senate.
“ I’ll say this: if he is not telling the Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not only incapable of being in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now, ” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh now serves as a judge at the appeal court in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the health law Affordable Care Act or the abortion laws of Roe v. Wade, where he is considered to be a conservative judge.
At the interrogation, Kavanaugh turned his back on questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“ This is no time for a mother - sick, partial person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say “a great thing is wonderful, ” Pelosi said.
And women need to take advantage of it.
This is a righteous speech, months and years of wrath, and it does not come out of it without weeping.
“ We cry when we get angry, ” said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
“ I don’t think it’s uncommon, but you ”
She continued: “I received much help from a woman who was manager somewhere and said that she was also weeping when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she was angry and began crying, she said to her interviewer: “You may think that I am sad because I am crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to express indignation partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from my previous work that I did in my office with men in the majority, where I began to cry with anger that I couldn't express, came an older woman and took me to the head. She was a cold commander that I had always feared a little and she pulled me into a ladder.
“ Never let them see you cry, ” she said to me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think that you are depressed, and rejoice that you have come in."
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was presidential, then a minister of Colorado Democrats.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught a flame of fraud on board a boat called Monkey Business (Apagame) and withdrawn her offer, Miss Schroeder, who was full of anger, felt that there was no reason for her to consider offering herself to the president.
“ This was not a well - thought decision, ” she laughed at me 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone gave this name “the white snow, and the seven dwarfs.”
Since the campaign had passed a long time, she was behind the fundraising process, so she promised not to volunteer unless she managed to collect two million dollars.
It was a lost fight.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
“ Do they think I'll get a discount? ” she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not offer herself formally, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - grateful to the people who had supported her, resentment for the system, which made it so difficult to earn money and direct her seas to voters instead of representatives, and anger to the sexual discrimination - that she broke into crying.
“ I could think I had a nervous breakdown, ” said Miss Schroeder when she remembers how the media responded.
“ It could be thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
Reasons that Business Wars Between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the commercial war between the United States and China were devastating, and even though the war is far from over, a gap between the countries could be beneficial for Peking for a long time, says experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, shot the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China’s main export goods, including sunflowers, steel, and aluminium.
This week, with new tariffs that cover the value of $200 billion ($150 billion, U.S.A.), the highest rate was to tax almost half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Peking has responded in the same coin each time and recently paid 5 to 10 percent of the tax on American products for $60 billion.
China has pledged to respond to the United States' customs reform, and it is unlikely that another major economy in the world will fall short.
To get Washington to hoop, we need to give in to demands, but it would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, President of China, to bow down publicly from the United States.
However, experts say that if Peking keeps the cards right, pressure from the business war with the United States could have a positive effect on China for a long time, by reducing the mutual need for both ecosystems for each other.
“ The fact that a swift political decision either in Washington or in Beijing could lead to circumstances that lead to economic collapse in one country is actually far more dangerous than the viewers have previously acknowledged, ” said Abigail Grace, a investigator who focuses primarily on Asia at the New American Security Centre.
Syria “prepared ” for refugees to return, says the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be prepared for refugees to return willingly to the land and seek help to rebuild the land, which is now in a bad condition after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, Foreign Minister, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, saying that the situation in the country is getting better.
“ Today, ” he said, “the conditions on earth are more stable and safe, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism. ”
The government continues to establish normal situations by building areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return willingly to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic decisions against their daily lives and jobs.
The United States estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that Syrian authorities would like help to rebuild the country.
On the other hand, he stressed that they would not accept aid depending on conditions or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 by conquering the United States team with the final results of 16.5 to 10.5 points at the Le Golf National Field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European ground and has not won the Ryder cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again recovered the crown when, under the leadership of the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, it reached the 14.5 points needed to conquer the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had most problems in the whole race, hit the 16th hole in the water and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined brightly in all its games and became 1 out of 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, since the contest began to use its current profile in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who was at the bottom of the order of the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the world’s best golfers, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who possibly played in his last race for the Ryder cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, eight times playing about the Ryder cup, became the winner of the European race with a score of 25.5 degrees.
“ I usually don’t weep, but today I can’t do anything else.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for having chosen me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get that cup back.
This is about the team, and I was happy to be able to help," said a emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He handed his country John Rahm tournament, but he conquered the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
“ I was incredibly proud of defeating Tiger Woods, ” said 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the race for the Ryder cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 big titles and is only in second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time all weekend to find themselves on the field, besides Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
The U.S. head of the United States, Jim Furyk, said after disappointment with his team’s performance: “I’m proud of them, they fought.
It was at some point in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him down.
I'll take off Thomasi.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with PGA in the United States and the name Ryder cup, and we'll continue.
I love these 12 men, and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take off.
They played better than us."
