She's not a good cook.
Tom said he's not in any hurry.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who does that.
I didn't know you weren't Canadians.
Come to watch us play music sometime.
Tom said he understands why Mary doesn't want to do that.
Tom said Mary was too busy to help you do that today.
Tom told me he'd complain about that.
Tom's a member of my co-op.
Tom drove down the street that Mary lives on, hoping to see her.
I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that.
You know as well as I do there's no chance Tom will do that.
Tom wasn't sure if he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
I know Tom might have to do that by himself.
Tom doesn't seem to do what he's supposed to do.
It would have been tiring to do that.
Tom must have told us the truth.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
We'll have to do something.
When do you plan to do that?
Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned to do that this week.
Tom knew he'd be punished.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone do that before.
That's not difficult.
I'm afraid we don't have any left.
Tom told me I should learn how to play the drums.
We have not yet succeeded.
I've never been to Paris.
Tom said he had eaten nothing, but that wasn't true.
I'm an atheist.
Tom said Mary was at home in bed with a cold.
I wonder if Tom really thought it was a good idea to do that.
Tom said Mary knew she might have to do that on her own.
Tom told me he thought Mary was puzzled.
Tom said he'd be happy to do that for you.
Tom said I looked a little pale.
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be confused.
Tom thought Mary was alone.
I know Tom's hiding something from me.
Did you know Tom didn't start playing the guitar until he was thirty years old?
I wonder if Tom knows that Mary wants to do that.
I'm sure Tom will be back.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary went on October 20.
I know Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
Why is everyone staring at us?
I know Tom didn't know who had done that to Mary.
I think Tom did that because everyone else in his family did.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary didn't know how to play the oboe.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank you.
I would have left early if I could.
I know I have to do that before Tom gets here.
I don't think you'd like to do that.
Tom hasn't talked to Mary about that yet.
I don't think Tom's handsome.
Tom was the only one sleeping.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't asleep.
I should never have let you go home alone last night.
I think I'm going to have the chance to do that the day after tomorrow.
Tom said you were really good at tennis.
Tom told me he thought Mary was autistic.
Tom would have wanted to go to Boston with you.
I know Tom is a lot more creative than Mary is.
I know Tom's a lot more creative than I am.
Tom said he doesn't want to know why we did that.
I think you'd all agree that Tom is one of our best singers.
Tom said he's desperate.
Tom said I don't have to do that this afternoon.
Tom said it was a good time to leave.
I know Tom's scared.
You can't appreciate the poem until you've read it many times.
I deliberately did that.
Tom should never have left early.
She's already married.
This is blasphemy!
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't awake.
Tom said he's glad he was able to do that.
You can't buy one of those for less than thirty dollars.
Do you think Tom would like to go to Australia with us?
Tom said he likes to dance with Mary.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary couldn't do that.
Tom must have seen us do that.
I doubt that Tom will run for President.
Tom should have done this yesterday.
Tom may be angry.
Tom said Mary won't be mad.
I knew Tom wanted us to do that for him.
Tom said he didn't live in Australia anymore.
I know Tom knew he didn't have to do that.
I hope I haven't forgotten anyone.
Tom said that Mary knew that she might not have to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be so angry.
I thought you liked romance novels.
I suspect Tom and Mary are bored.
Tom has already been told about the problem.
I know Tom was disobedient.
I don't know anyone who hates Tom.
Tom said he thinks I'd be able to win.
Three years ago, I was in Boston.
I don't think I could do what Tom's doing.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
Riches doesn't interest me.
Tom said he thought I seemed impressed.
Tom said he had no objection to our leave early.
It's not for beginners.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were depressed.
I don't think Tom knows how to swim.
Tom has a lot of friends here.
Tom knows he cheated.
I think Tom used to be a member of our club.
Where's your notebook?
I don't think I'll be as early tomorrow as I was today.
It's not likely Tom will ever admit he's wrong.
How many miles is it from here to the railroad station?
I don't think that story is true.
He often adopts the behaviours and speech patterns that characterise the advantaged.
Tom said you were his friend.
I'm thinking about having dinner at six.
Tom told Mary he'd do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's through.
Tom said Mary's dog bit him.
Tom said he was done with that.
Tom said he's appealing to his suspension.
He's deeply attached to her.
I thought you'd show me how to do that.
I'm telling you we have to assume that Tom is dead.
Mary's got a hairdresser's appointment.
Tom said Mary thought that she might be allowed to do that today.
If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It smells like someone's been smoking a cigar in here.
We're just in time for the last train.
I think that question is not appropriate.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a kid?
I don't think anyone noticed what we were doing.
What are we gonna do?
I could have cried.
There's no free lunch.
I thought you said we weren't going to Boston with Tom.
Tom's quitting smoking.
I think I know what Tom's doing here.
Tom and Mary said they'd be happy to help.
I'm pretty sure that's not going to happen.
They're not as fussy as they used to be.
We go to school every day except on Sundays.
Tom told me Mary wasn't hungry.
Tom thought he was probably not going to survive.
Tom told me he thought Mary was bilingual.
Tom said he thought he forgot to lock the door.
Tom told Mary to wash her car.
They said they didn't want to argue.

Are you both Canadians?
Why would anyone want to kiss Tom?
I knew Tom had never actually done that.
They said they had no other details.
Tom thought Mary liked me, but I knew she hated me.
Tom thinks I need to go.
Tom told everyone he didn't understand French.
They said they don't like that.
Not everyone hugged Tom.
Everyone needed to do that.

I turned off the lights.
She's a shopping addict.
Tom said Mary was going back to Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't sleepy.
Tom thought Mary was listening, but she wasn't.
I thought you said Tom was a shaver.
I wonder if this really works.
Let's get to the point.
Did you give the key to Tom?
Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him she had to do that.
My father is a doctor.
I don't think I'd like to be married to Tom.
I didn't know you couldn't sing.
Tom often does that by himself.
I've learned a lot from this conversation.
I thought Tom would buy that car.
Tom and Mary said they're very busy right now.
Tom said he was planning to stay at home all day.
Tom should have apologized to Mary.
Tom said he believed Mary.
I'm afraid I can't finish this report in time.
Tom was about thirty years old when he moved to Boston.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary needs to do that.
Everyone here except Tom and Mary have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was satisfied.
Tom said he was going to help us do that.
Tom's house is very close to my house.
The host cut theturkey for the guests.
I know Tom doesn't know he doesn't really have to do that.
I think Tom will be able to understand that.
I haven't decided yet.
I know that's not worth doing.
Tom told me he thought Mary had been rude.
It's not wrong.
Tom and Mary told me they felt offended.
I'm very grateful to you.
Tom's bad.
I knew Tom wasn't as good a student as Mary.
Mary told me she was at home.
Tom said Mary thought John might want to do that.
I know Tom's forgetful.
Tom said Mary was mad.
Tom says he's not guilty.
Nobody laughed at Tom's joke.
Tom said it's not his biggest problem.
We're planning on leaving tomorrow.
I think Tom snores louder than Mary.
What are you trying to do?
We didn't know if Tom and Mary were busy or not.
Tom and Mary said they were planning to go.
You better take off your shoes.
I didn't think we were doing anything wrong.
Everyone knew Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom has already decided that he will sign the contract.
Is it true that you were there?
What do you think Tom would have done?
They say they're not coming.
Tom said he was really glad he had been asked to do that.
I think Tom is likely to be there tonight.
Tom said he might do that.
Tom told Mary he would never do that again.
I expect Tom to cry right now.
You're really an angel!
Tom has already decided that he will not try to escape.
Tom told Mary that either he or she had to do that.
Tom has already decided that he won't do that.
Tom's a terrible joke teller, because he often forgets the punchline.
Tom and I are both hungry.

Tom told me he thought Mary was trustworthy.
Tom said Mary is probably still scared.
Tom and Mary said they did that on Monday.
Tom doesn't know I've never done that.
Tom told me I should go to Boston with Mary.
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their father.
I know Tom's missing.
I would have liked to do that.
It won't be so hard to do that.
Don't let Tom do that alone.
I was so excited!
Tom's a party animal.
I thought it might be fun, so I went to Tom's party.
Tom is unlikely to have to do that today.
I hope I don't have to do that.
Tom must have changed a lot.
Nobody's better at this than me.
As soon as I saw Tom, I could tell that he was angry.
I know Tom knows he shouldn't do that here.
He's here.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is now.
My wife is also a scientist.
I turned off the computer.
Tom and Mary told me they weren't prepared.
Tom said Mary is probably still mad.
I'm pretty sure Tom has relatives in Australia.

Tom wasn't impressed.

I don't think Tom will do that, too.
Tom was the only one who knew what had happened to Mary.
Where do you plan to do that?
I didn't know you'd be done by 2:30.
Tom said he'd be thirteen next month.
I wish I were on your side!
Get your paws off me.
I'm afraid I have to refuse.
I know you've just retired.
I knew Tom would be happy if you did that.
I wonder if we'll really do that today.
Tom's sleeping.
You're a good boy.
I should've just walked right in.
I don't think you've been listening to me.
We're brothers and sisters.
I don't think Tom's done that.
I don't think we've done anything illegal.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try it before.
Don't you have a TV?
Don't give up!
I don't play mandolin as well as you.
Tom said that he thought that Mary might not be required to do that anymore.
I don't know why you can't admit you need me.
The feeling is mutual.
Tom's known Mary since he was a kid.
Tom said he expects to do that on Monday.
I don't think Tom knows that I love Mary.
I think Tom will go to Boston next week.
It's not far from the hotel.
I have to find it.

Tom said he doesn't think Mary really knows how to do that very well.
I'm sure Tom feels the same way you do.
Tom said he feels sick.
Tom said Mary thought John might not be required to do that.
I hope no one followed you.
Tom knows he should have been able to do that better.
I know Tom will be motivated to do that.
Do you think we should have talked to Tom about this?
Tom said he wish he hadn't given Mary any money.
Tom may not be able to do that.
I know you're not enjoying yourself here.

I know Tom doesn't know Mary's planning to do that.
Tom wanted everyone to know he was unhappy.
I know Tom wanted me to do that.
You look busy.
Tom and Mary both looked at John.
They think they're stronger than me.
I read this in the paper.
How do I improve?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
They told me they'd be discreet.
I should have written it down.
I'm not hungry anymore.
You can do it.
Tom likes to keep things to himself.
I don't think everyone's given up.
I thought you had convinced Tom to help us.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to Tom's funeral.
I'm very happy.

I know some of your students don't like you.
Kyoko had the kindness to carry my luggage for me.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hurt.
Tom said Mary knew he might not have to do that by himself.
It's not very likely to rain tomorrow.
I didn't know you weren't planning to do that next winter.
I don't know what this means.
I think it is more important to discuss possible solutions.
I didn't realize both Tom and Mary should do that.
Tom and Mary both snore?
It's way past the time Tom promised he'd be here.
We're not going on vacation.
I don't think I'll be able to do what I want to do.
I think Tom's doing it well.
Tom and I know that Mary wants to do that tomorrow.

Tom said he thought it would be better if we didn't.
I thought everyone here was a vegetarian.
Tom said Mary didn't look happy to him.

Tom won't admit he was wrong.
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

We should have brought lunch.
The leading brand of pop drinks in most countries is Coca-Cola.

My father's not talking.
I know Tom won't be forgiven for doing that.
I sure hope Tom gets here on time.
Tom thought Mary was just pretending to be happy.
You promise you won't tell Tom I gave you his phone number?

They said they think they can do that.
I wonder if I can do that again.
I feel depressed often.

Tom said he thought he had to do that.
I wonder if Tom has already done that.
You should have eaten some cake.
Tom said he doesn't think you need to do that.
Tom and Mary think they have the flu.
Who told you we needed to do that?
Tom said Mary's only done that once.
I knew Tom wasn't a very nice guy.
Tom knew he should have done that on his own.
What's cooking in the kitchen?
I'm grateful for your help.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interested in doing that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was weird.
They're hiding.
Tom realized he wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
I don't think Tom will do that with you.
I'm tired of homework.
I don't think I'm gonna dance with Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I didn't start studying French until I was thirty.
I think Tom is unbeatable.
It should have been easy to accomplish.

I'm proud of you.
It was clear that Tom had intended to do that yesterday.

I should have helped you do that.
Tom said he'd give Mary a book.
I think Tom can sing country music better than anyone else I know.
Tom and Mary both saw you.
Tom thinks Mary will be able to convince John to do that.
I don't know if Tom works there or not.
There is no question about it.
No one could solve the problem.
I won't talk to him anymore.
I think Tom's going to do that too.
I shouldn't have allowed you to do that.
I've already met everyone.
Tom said Mary would do that too.
Tom said he didn't do anything wrong.
Tom and Mary told me they wouldn't wait.

I didn't know you'd let Tom do that by yourself.
I know Tom might want to do that.

It's a deadly poison!
They know they're being watched.
Tom told me he thought Mary could speak French.
Tom might be sleeping.
I know Tom's not a very good manager.
I don't care whether you do that or not.
It's not rocket science.
Tom said he wanted to help us.
There's someone waiting for you.
They said they were ready.
Tom and Mary said they felt lightheaded.
You know you shouldn't do that, don't you?
Nothing's been done.
Let's make sure that doesn't happen.
I know Tom knows why we couldn't do that for him.
Tom said he thought that could happen in Boston too.
I didn't know Tom was an ancoma.
I think Tom would like to be the next one to do that.
Tom said I was the one with the problem.
You're not expected to do that, are you?
We'll climb the mountain if it's okay tomorrow.
Nobody told Tom what to do.
Have you ever hit anyone?
I don't think Tom was mad.
I knew Tom knew how to do that.
Tom and Mary told me they were healthy.
I think that's wrong.
There's a place for everything.
Tom said he won't be allowed to do that anymore.
I told Tom you were hungry.
Tom's pretty sure he saw a wolf.
I don't think it's up to you to decide.
I thought you were retired.

They said they had to work.
My father won't be busy tomorrow.

No one else was there.
Tom told Mary he'd decided to stay a few more days.
I know Tom wasn't the first to do that.
Tom said he didn't have to do that.
I didn't think you'd do that by yourself.
I don't think we have enough food to feed everyone.
I know Tom's not a bad person.
It is said that he knows the secret.
I think Tom would be a good roommate.
Tom said that Mary thought that he might be required to do that.
I know Tom didn't know who had done that for him.
Tom said he's fine.
Why didn't you tell me you didn't want my help?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that today.
I just want you to consider the possibility that you are wrong.
I'm sure I didn't say that.
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels.
I'm as happy as I can be.
If they had known what was about to happen, they would have changed their plans.
I know Tom didn't know he didn't want to do that.
Tom's rich, but he's not as rich as Mary.
Go wake up Tom and tell him that breakfast is ready.
Tom was surprised that Mary was still up.
I should have left early.
Tom said he knew Mary might not have to do that by himself.
Tom said his failure was due to bad luck.
I didn't think Tom would be alone.
Tom said he's not planning to buy anything.
She has to be taken to the hospital.
Things didn't go the way I'd hoped.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't get there until after dark.
Tom said Mary knew that he wanted to do that again.
I know Tom's careless.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary he'd go to Australia with her.
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time.
Tom's not home right now.
Tom said he likes skiing too.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this matter with you.
I think you shouldn't have done that on your own.
Tom said that Mary thought he might not want to do that until it gets cooler.
I didn't think Tom was upset.
Tom said he wasn't aware that Mary had done that.
Tom said he's faster at doing that than Mary is.
Tom and Mary told me they felt hot.
I didn't know Tom was supposed to do that by himself.
We split up the loot three ways.
I don't think Tom could do that alone.
Tom told me I was pretty.
What time does the show start?
Tom knows he has to help Mary tomorrow.
Tom won't probably go jogging with Mary.
I don't think Tom knows who did that to Mary.
All three of my brothers are older than me.
Tom said he didn't know if he could do that.
I know Tom couldn't do that.
Keep left at the next traffic lights.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom loves Mary.
Tom doesn't need Mary's help.
Tom and Mary say they're lonely.
Were you afraid the first time you were on a plane?
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.
I don't think Tom is the one who needs to apologize.
I'm disappointed in my son.
I don't think I did very well.
Do you think there's a chance you'll do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There's a big supermarket.
I suspected Tom was discouraged.
I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not be allowed to do that.
I would have done the same thing Tom did.
Are you sure nobody can see us?
There is no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I suspected Tom might not have enough money to buy everything he wanted.
Has he been in touch with you?
Tom and Mary said they'd be doing that soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today is the twentieth of October.
Tom and Mary said they were planning to go.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's not Canadian.
Africa is not a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have kids.
I know Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I don't think that book is so interesting.
I was told that's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team will continue to get better.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom definitely knows he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It's a big responsibility.
I think you should turn yourself in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should have known I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know you and Tom were working together.
Nobody'll know I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed to get more exercise.
Tom told me he'd try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels.
I knew Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she shouldn't do that.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom doesn't know Mary's in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom's concerned.
I wish I had the chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew Tom was going to be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
Tom said that Mary thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom said he probably wouldn't win.
It's possible Tom doesn't know I'm here.
Do you think I'm weird?
Tom thinks he knows everything.
Tom said it's not gonna end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do that today.
I thought we had something to give to Tom.
The students did the work themselves.
Tom and Mary said they didn't mind doing that.
You'll stay here until you're called.
My daughter is being trained.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they were fine.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something happened to him.
Nobody suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they've never met you.
I think Tom is a pretty good painter.
I know Tom is a picky eater and rarely tries anything new.
Tom says he didn't do anything illegal.
I suspect Tom knows Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know Tom knows I know how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still talking away.
You're a nerd.
Everyone was late except me.
He could not resist the temptation.
Tom will probably get angry if you do that.
I assumed Tom would agree to do that.
I'm a liberterian.
Can I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom will have to do that alone.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing's not as good as it used to be.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted he had been rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should have let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now either in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should talk about that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know Tom's a little older than Mary is.
Tom didn't know someone had been hired to kill him.
Tom told me he can't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would like to do that.
Tom said he thought I might not have to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me he thought he might be able to do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was very eager to do that.
Am I the only one who's confused?
I know Tom's a bully.
He's a very clever boy.
How's your dad?
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn't get jealous.
I'm pretty sure that wasn't what Tom meant.
It won't be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look tired to him.
I doubt that Tom would ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning on going anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it looks like.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he had never planned to live in Australia for so long.
Tom told me he didn't really want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot more books than you do.
I know Tom's about the same height as you are.
There is no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have been the one who put the drugs in my bag.
Tom said he's glad Mary wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she had read the book that he had lent her.
I woke up at 7:00.
I could have done that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't told anyone they're getting married yet.
They said they planned on Monday.
It won't be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't talk so fast, please.
They told me they had bacon and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone they had to do that.
I think Tom paid too much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worn out.
Tom told me he thought Mary was busy.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was finished.
I thought you had to work.
Tom said he didn't have everything he needed.
You should have stayed where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose weight.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could have kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary isn't awake.
Did anyone else hug Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to annoy me.
That's a mistake.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone afraid?
Tom thinks he can do anything he wants.
We were married seven years ago.
I could have done that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could have done that any better.
I know Tom didn't do that right.
She's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary's better in French than she really is.
Tonight I'm free.
Do you think Tom would have done that?
That's his house.
I'm at home.
You don't have to pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should have tried harder.
I thought Tom was going to do that today.
They promised they'd check it out.
I'm sure Tom would have agreed.
Tom and Mary said they don't like that.
Tom said he knew that he might have to do that by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the final goal, but the process of getting there that matters.
Tom must have fought.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance Tom might get hurt.
Tom said he was glad you had done that.
I always knew Tom was a troublemaker.
Well I never!
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to win.
I'm a student, but he's not.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary was planning to do.
I wonder if Tom's really homesick.
Tom and Mary said they can't sing very well.
Tom said he thought Mary was good at French.
Tom says he'll always love Mary.
I wish I could speak French as fluently as you do.
I wish I were someone else.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom's not busy.
I just wanted you to know I'm supporting you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We're all in serious danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I just made an egg for myself.
Do you have a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next summer.
Tom and Mary will probably not be able to buy everything they need for $300.
They said they like this time of year.
Tom wants Mary to know that she can trust him.
They say they declined that deal.
I know Tom didn't know you couldn't do that.
I think I'll stay in Australia for a few more weeks.
With his last breath, he told him he was adopted.
I know Tom is a very close friend of Mary's.
I know Tom didn't know who was supposed to do that.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wouldn't do that?
I know Tom would unlikely agree to do that.
Tom shut down his computer.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
It's obvious Tom can't do that without any help.
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans to do that.
Tom could have asked me first.
You're not actually suggesting that I go out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should have.
I don't think Tom's bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't do that.
I would have done that by myself if Tom hadn't helped me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary he thought John wasn't hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me he thought Mary had done that.
Tom and Mary swore they'd never hit me again.
Tom said he should have stayed in Australia longer.
Tom said he knew they might not allow him to do that at school.
I know I can do this.
I don't think I should have left before Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy over there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I've already told Tom I need to do that.
I plan to stay at home all day Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one contradicted Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom's having fun of what's going on?
We have not yet begun to fight.
Who's knocking on the door?
I think Tom's the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they're supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said shocked everyone.
Tom and Mary told me they were ambidextrous.
Tom said that he thought that what Mary did was a mistake.
I hope no one comes.
I thought everyone could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said he thought Mary was in her bedroom study.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Tom told me it didn't matter.
I know Tom wanted Mary to do that.
I'm 12.
I forgot about that.
Tom told everyone he was done with that.
They thought there was no hope.
Tom said Mary didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were pleased.
I thought you said you were glad you didn't do that.
Tom can speak French a little bit.
I know Tom's much taller than I am.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that that's gonna happen.
I knew Tom wasn't very busy.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom's quicker to do that than Mary.
Tom said that he thought that Mary might not be required to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me do that.
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
Everyone's having a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said he did.
Tom and Mary both wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom will be able to do that.
Tom thought it was difficult.
We've walked all over the lake.
I don't think it's gonna be hard to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom's as rich as most people think he is.
You won't do that.
You're so hot!
Tom would have been thirty years old today if he hadn't passed away last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know Tom knows that I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom is safe.
I know Tom didn't know he shouldn't be doing that here.
Do Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like doing that.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
You're as tall as my sister.
Tom's read a lot of books about that.
I think Tom's already done enough.
Do you know anyone in Boston?
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Tom admitted that he was the one who had stolen Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told they had to do that.
We better tell the others.
Why is everybody talking about Tom?
Feders lucky to promise at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them to.
I know Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself.
Tom said he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together.
I didn't say anything, and that made him angry.
When will he be finished?
You're a very nasty boy.
Tom's planning to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of pile with some kebabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom they were planning to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary could do that or not.
Who sends letters by mail? These days we have emails.
If anything sounds too good to be true, then it is probably.
Tom said he hopes you don't want to do that.
Tom said he wished he hadn't been there.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not in any hurry.
We may need to be in Australia for several weeks.
I didn't plan to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
Tom said he expected Mary to participate.
I swim every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
They pretended they didn't know me.
I know Tom's a little shorter than Mary is.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
I'm sure Tom won't do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
You know Tom and I are not going to do that, are you?
Tom and Mary told me they finished doing that by 2:30.
I'm sure we should have turned back there.
Everyone knows Tom speaks good Gaulish.
I thought maybe you wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he had forgotten something.
She doesn't like snakes and mathematics.
I knew Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom's really got a lot on his plate right now.
I knew Tom knew who needed to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.
That is not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know Tom's a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
That's not possible with current technology.
They said they tried to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office speaks French.
I wonder if Tom has already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're sick.
Tom said he's not allowed to do that.
I assume you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
You have a sense of humour.
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that.
It's not something I want to discuss.
I think Tom will refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Can you cook an omelette?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk anymore.
I wonder if we could do anything to help.
Tom said he would be willing to help us do that.
I don't think Tom is capable of that.
Tom didn't know he had to do that by himself.
Tom's dating a girl who's three years younger than he is.
I don't think Tom would refuse to do that.
Tom said he wasn't interested in sports.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I know Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think Tom will like this wine.
I think we talked on the phone.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There's a certain amount of truth in what he's saying.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom's a shovel.
He's not a virtuoso.
I suspect Tom lied to me.
Tom will eventually have to do that.
Tom told me he'd call at 2:30.
Tom hasn't told Mary what he has to do yet.
I know Tom's a good diver.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should have stayed home.
I don't think this is enough food to feed all of us.
He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he's planning to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed my friends aren't here.
A wolf cannot be tamed.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he hasn't done anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what he should have been doing.
Tom said I should study harder.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't get paid.
Are you worried that that might happen?
I know Tom doesn't know Mary did that.
Do not forget to take your umbrella when you leave here.
I'll see to it that gets done.
I'm wearing a suit, but I don't wear a tie.
I'm as tired as you.
Tom thought he might be coming down with a cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I should have apologized right away.
You're lucky you didn't get hurt.
Where do Tom and Mary plan to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.
Are you sure Tom will do that?
We can't live without air.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary.
Tom says Mary has always lived in Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't nervous.
Tom knows something we don't.
Tom said he was worried about Mary.
We all got in the car.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that or not.
Last night I puked.
Tom's not very good at bowling.
Tom said Mary gave him something.
Give me some water.
Tom said he wants to write a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be mad.
I don't think you've been paying attention.
We'll need more time.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's doing.
Tom said Mary's gonna do that tomorrow.
You're both welcome to come with us.
I can't believe Tom is actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.
Tom said he ate too much.
We're all looking forward to your coming.
I don't think Tom will stop doing that anytime soon.
Have I ever told you guys about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying French when I was thirteen years old.
Tom said he wish he hadn't played chess with Mary.
I know Tom will probably allow you to do that.
Is it okay if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said that Mary knew that John might not have to do that by himself.
I wonder if Tom is motivated.
Tom said he would have done that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that.
I think Tom wouldn't like it if Mary did that.
I still wish you would do that.
Mary let me know that she wasn't planning to stay very long.
I didn't know you'd be jealous.
Tom didn't know Mary had children.
They say they can't wait that long.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom might be lonely.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't very busy.
I'm absolutely sure that's not going to happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said he was glad you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom has no idea where Mary is planning to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them do that.
You're very annoying.
I have already finished reading this book.
I knew Tom wouldn't be a very good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You've finished your homework, haven't you?
What could have happened?
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary likes him or not.
I got lost in the woods.
I know Tom's a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.
Tom told me he'll be in Boston next Monday.
Shut your mouth!
Tom said he knew he might have to do that on Monday.
Tom said he regretted what had happened.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary he had to do that.
Tom knew Mary was sick.
Do you have a pen on you?
Tom lets Mary do what she wants to do.
I'll wait until 2:30.
My parents won't let me do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time it takes for him to do that.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried on his father's clothes.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary why he did that.
Tom said he's been trying to do that all week.
You really have beautiful teeth!
No one knew Tom was the person who contributed most of the money.
Everyone knew Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was frustrated.
Tom and I were both a little confused.
I'm sure Tom knew that was going to happen.
Tom told me he thought he could do that.
I admitted I did what Tom said I shouldn't do.
Did you know Tom and Mary had three children?
It's not just a minor problem.
I'm not satisfied with your explanation.
I know Tom's done that already.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should have done that.
There must be a reason Tom's not here.
It's not right to be late for a dinner party.
Tom told me he thought Mary could run faster than he could.
Tom said Mary's scared.
You should have been the last one to do that.
I know Tom's a farmer, but I don't know where his farm is.
Tom says the matter is urgent.
Tom said Mary doesn't like that.
What could go wrong?
No one could have stopped that.
Tom said he had to share a hotel room with a stranger.
I know I said I'd do that, but I can't do it today.
I think Tom's over-emotional.
I'm immune to pox.
Tom sometimes sleeps on my couch.
My class was canceled.
Tom and Mary told me that to be gone by the time they got here.
Tom promised me he'd be here by 2:30.
Tom said he thinks Mary can take care of herself.
It's not as cold here as I expected it was.
Tom said he just got back from Australia.
I don't think I'll be alone.
I can't work now.
The game is about to begin.
Tom said Mary was born in Boston.
I don't think Tom's gonna be surprised.
I know Tom would be willing to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was jealous.
Anybody else know you're here?
Tom said he wanted to go to the zoo.
Tom said he thought Mary was unhappy in Boston.
Didn't you know Tom wasn't planning to do that?
I know Tom knew who was going to do that for me.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's not happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do this without Tom.
Tom said he didn't think the noise bothered Mary.
No one ran.
Tom said Mary would probably do that.
I met someone who knows that we do.
Tom said he thought those shoes were too expensive.
Tom said he knew he might not have to do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried Tom's gonna get lost.
They told me they were next.
I suspect Tom and Mary are not as eager to do that now as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't ticklish.
I know Tom did that just to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smarter than that.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
That's not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm ugly.
Tom told me he called you.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have been doing that.
Tom and Mary told me they ate too much.
He's old enough to drive a car.
Tom said he thought he forgot to lock the door.
I know Tom's afraid people might laugh at him.
Tom said Mary was likely to still be mad.
Tom and Mary say they feel better now.
They hate foreigners; I hate everyone.
Tom said he's not sure Mary can swim.
I don't know if Tom will come tomorrow or not.
They said they were very busy.
I promise you we'll find a bigger place.
I think Tom is the only one who has to do that.
I didn't think you'd win.
I don't think Tom will have time to do that with us today.
I know Tom is very opinioned.
We cannot let these start-ups push us around.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's boyfriend is.
I knew Tom knew who could do that and who couldn't.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom's not so sure.
Everyone here knows we don't eat pork.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
I think Tom doesn't know how to do that.
I've already told Tom I'm not planning to do that.
I thought it would be fun living in Boston for a year or two.
It's not healthy to skip meals.
I'm happy to meet you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I suspect Tom and Mary are the ones who did that.
I bet I can sit here longer without saying anything than you can.
It's not done yet.
I know Tom's not on the team anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom just turned on the radio.
Tom has already decided he won't say yes.
I know Tom's a little snobbish.
What's in the box?
Tom said Mary knew he might not want to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're not alone.
Tom said he would have done that by himself if he could have.
Admitting that there is a problem is the first step to fix the problem.
Mary said she was planning to go.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be absent.
Tom said Mary lied.

Tell Tom I'm coming.

They say they'll pay for everything.
Tom said he assumed you would do that.
They are fascinated by blood and violence.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want this.
No one knows exactly where Tom will go.
You should make sure you don't make Tom angry.
I didn't know that we weren't supposed to do that by ourselves.
Some think it's a bad idea.
How do I know you're not gonna try to kill me?
I wonder if Tom really went to Boston.
Tom said he thought about doing that.
I don't think Tom's gonna be alone.
I can't figure out why he's done that.

You never know what's gonna happen tomorrow.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who needs to do that.

I thought it had to be good.
It might be good to do that.
I thought Tom had seen me.
If I had known Tom's address, I would have written to him.

Do you have vegetarian pilaf?
I know you need to go to Boston.

Stop criticizing me!
Tom says he didn't do it.
I'm looking for you.
Tom said he knew I wasn't gonna cry.
Tom said we couldn't do anything about it.
I think Tom's just curious.
Everyone knows Tom was the one who broke the window.
Here's my pink notebook.
I knew I could trust you!
I don't think Tom knows what he wants.
I didn't know Tom didn't have to do that alone.
It's not like Tom's going anywhere.
Tom told me he was hesitant to do that.
I pretended I didn't know what to do.
I know Tom's a bum.
I didn't think Tom would allow you to do that.
I want to go change into that shirt I bought yesterday.
Tom said he thought Mary was lying.
We should have stayed with you.
I don't think Tom's lonely.
This is not the first time I've done this.
If Tom can't do that, probably no one else can either.
I thought Tom might stop by this afternoon.
I think the economic impact will be minimal.
You should let Tom know that Mary is going to do that.
It would have been fun to do that.

Did you know Tom was planning on moving to Boston?

Tom said he thought Mary wasn't done that.
I thought that was what we were supposed to do.
I would never do that to you.
Tom should have been quicker to do that than Mary.
Tom and Mary said they were planning on going on Monday.
That's not what Tom really needs.
They know they can do better.
There's no way Tom would have done what you said he did.
Tom said he wasn't allowed to do that anymore.
You're tired, aren't you?
Tom did that on his own?
Tom and Mary say they used to study French.
Tom admitted he killed Mary.
I would have been there right now if my car hadn't broken down.
We're brothers.
I wrote a long letter to Tom.
It's gonna be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I don't think giving Tom a knife was a good idea.
I thought you were going to kill me.
I think there's a possibility Tom will do that.
It is surprising that they should have a second house in America.
They told me they were depressed.
My mother can't drive a car at all.
There's a lot going on right now.
I wonder if Tom is rich.
It's not necessary for me to do that.
I didn't think anyone noticed what Tom did.
I think you're bossy.
Tom backed his car up to check, but the raccoon he had run over was dead as a doornail.
Tom and Mary said they're not mad.
I wonder if Tom has ever told Mary what we did that day.
Close that door.
The only reason Tom went to Australia because everyone else in his family did.
I thought Tom would ask Mary to the prom.
Are you sure nobody can see us?
He has a great fancy for travelling.

I'm not sure Tom would let anyone help Mary.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were jealous.
Tom and Mary told me they were home sick.
I think you know we need to buy some more food.
I'm surprised Tom didn't want to go with us.
I asked Tom and Mary if they knew anyone who taught French.
Tom must have left his umbrella on the bus.
They told me they're broke.
No one but Tom did that.
I don't think Tom's gonna be surprised that it happened.
I guess you're not interested in going with us.
It's not easy to be understood by everyone.
I'm hungry.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who needed to do that.
I thought you might want something cold to drink.
Tom told me he wouldn't go to Boston unless I went with him.
No one's seen them.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sleepy.
Tom said he'd definitely do that this week.
That's not my responsibility.
I think Tom's a student at Harvard.
I didn't know I was doing that the wrong way.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was happy that was going to happen.
If it hadn't been for the storm, I would have arrived sooner.
They said they'd do that for us.
I thought you only dated girls shorter than you.
Tom said he thought prices at that store were too high.
Tom said he didn't feel like eating.
Tom spends a lot of money buying things he never uses.
I thought you said I could count on you.
Tom said he sold his car three weeks ago.
Tom spent the money his grandmother had given him on books.
This is the first time I've been away from my family for more than three weeks.
You should have said that at that time.
Tom and Mary say they'll only talk to you.
Tom told me he didn't have as many friends as Mary did.
I've parked my car here many times and nobody's complained.
Tom said he was sad.
Tom said he didn't think Mary needed to tell John what to do.
Tom said he was going home.
I didn't know Tom was going to be arrested.
I know I'm going to regret this.
Tom thought Mary was bored.
Tom thought Mary would be ready to do that.
Do you have any idea when Tom's planning to get here?
I know you're not planning on staying in Boston.
I wonder if that could happen again.
I suspect Tom and Mary are from Boston.
I couldn't keep looking at it.
I think Tom doesn't know Mary can speak French.
The currently available evidence does not allow me to make such a claim.
Tom said he's very sure Mary has to do that.
Tom would have been happy if you had done that.
Tom said he wants to talk to you.
I thought you were a doctor.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Tom said he needed to stay home.
I thought you were happy.
I could have stopped it.
It's not healthy to eat and run.
I didn't think Tom would be forgiven.
Tom said Mary was asked not to do that.
We're invited to dinner.
Tom and Mary said they felt resentful.
I know Tom's afraid he'll get lost.
I ate the same thing Tom did.
I know Tom would be able to convince Mary to do that if he tried.
Tom thinks I'm missing a great opportunity.
I know Tom's not a very good guitar player.
Tom and I were both impressed.
Everyone knows Tom's lying.
They're not as young as they say they are.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
Did you know Tom wasn't planning to do that?
I never thought I'd go there.
You know that's not true.
I know Tom and Mary have already left Australia.
You're not like anyone else I know.
Tom and Mary said they felt the same.
Tom is probably planning to stay in Boston until October.
Tom thought you could take care of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
Tom has decided he's not going to work today.
Tom denied that he was the one who asked Mary to do that.
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom.
That's not happening!
I knew Tom wouldn't get caught.
It's not gonna work out.
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom said that Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom told Mary and I that we should try to do that by ourselves.
You know it's not like that.
I wouldn't have been able to do that without your help.
I knew Tom didn't really want to do that on his own.
Tom said he's looking forward to his retirement.
Whether we do that now or later doesn't matter.
Let's hope things stay this way.
I should have anticipated that Tom wouldn't get along with Mary.
I think it is highly unlikely that Tom was not aware that he would not be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.
I wonder if Tom really knows the combination to this safe.
Someone's singing.
Mary doesn't plan to do that until I tell her.
I didn't know you were supposed to do that this afternoon.
Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.
I didn't realize Tom didn't like Mary.
I don't think that can be fixed.
I didn't think Tom really wanted to know.
Tom didn't even know Mary used to live in Boston.
I didn't know you needed to do that today.
You should have joined your children months ago.
I don't think it's mine.
I think Tom's thirty years old.
Think about it.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
I didn't think anyone would like Tom.
I thought Tom might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I didn't think anyone's ever done that kind of thing before.
Tom didn't know Mary was planning to stay.
That's not something I know how to do.
I think I'll be able to fix it myself.
I didn't think anyone did that.
Tom said we'd get lost.
Tom said he should do that.
Are you sure Mary said she was planning to do that tomorrow?
There were times I would have been lost without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom told me he thought Mary was crazy.
Tom already knows that Mary did that.
You're not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
It's not going to end well.
I think I need someone to help me.
Tom wrote all the caps.
Tom's gonna be very happy he didn't do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that alone.
If I were you, I'd go home immediately.
It's not like you knew what they were going to do.
Tom and I are planning to stay together.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
So what are you suggesting?
Tom said he learned something new.
I know Tom's married.
Tom said he thought the economy was in bad shape.
I thought you were judging something.
I've been studying English for three years.
Tom is the only man I'd ever consider marrying.
I didn't think Tom would be awake when I got home.
Tom told me he thought Mary was paralyzed.
I know Tom's not planning to do that.
Tom didn't know you were from Boston.
It's not as difficult as it sounds.
Tom and Mary shouted, but no one heard them.
Tom and Mary say they want to swim.
Tom said Mary was likely to still be lonely.
I didn't think Tom would be arrested.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to join the team.
You promised not to be rude to me anymore.
Tom thought it would take longer.
I wonder if Tom knew he needed to do that.
I think Tom's like that.
Tom had all kinds of problems.
I knew Tom would like you to do that for him.
I thought Tom wanted to see this movie.
I think Tom's still undetermined.
I'm Tom's dad.
I just want to let you know that I think you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Tom said he'd do his homework before dinner.
Tom stared at Mary and said nothing.
I wonder if Tom's really asleep.
Tom and Mary said they want to die.
Tom said he's had enough of that.
I suspect Tom is on vacation.
Tom told me he was too tired to study tonight, so he just wanted to watch TV.
I don't think Tom's very bright.
Tom said he thought Mary had to do that before John got here.
Doing that would have been easy.
Tom said he thought he might be required to do that by himself.
That's very good.
Tom says he wasn't the one who broke the window.
It was clear Tom was going to do that.
They're not sure they should do that.
The kind of information we need is not always available.
I'd rather not talk about it.
I didn't think anyone saw us.
We can't turn back.
I know Tom knows we shouldn't do that.
You didn't know I didn't have to do that, did you?
Tom suspected it was too late to help Mary.
Tom and I both sat back down.
Tom was wearing the tie Mary gave him.
Tom and Mary said they weren't alone.
The question is not so much what it is as what it looks like.
I know Tom's almost always right, but this time he's not.
Tom said it wouldn't be dangerous.
You're my hero, Sami.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom said he felt insulted.
Tom knew Mary would win.
Tom and Mary said they don't want this.
It's not about them.
I thought you said you wanted to do that on your own.
Tom must have had a key.
Tom knew there was a possibility that Mary would do that.
You're so lazy.
Tom and Mary said they weren't Canadian.
Tom and Mary told me they were faint.
It's not socially acceptable to point to people.
Tom would have allowed Mary to do that.
I wish we'd stayed in Australia for another week.
Here's the map you were looking for.
I thought you said you'd never do that again.
Tom knows why Mary's planning to go to Australia.
I wonder if we have to do that.
I know Tom will never forgive Mary for doing that.
This is the third time this week Tom has done that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are going to say anything about what happened.
I know Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to be doing that today.
Tom says everyone he knows can swim.
Tom said he had a shovel in his pickup truck.
It was clear that Tom liked to do that by himself.
I don't think what I did was wrong.
I knew Tom was scared.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to stay in Australia very long.
I thought I'd find you here.
It's not clear who wrote this letter.
They must have been tired.
Tom's doing okay.
Tom said he thought he didn't have to do that.
Tom said that Mary knew that he might not want to do that until John had time to help him.
I didn't think Tom would like that.
I should never have got you into this.
I think everyone trusts me.
I was surprised when Tom told me he wanted to do that.
I hope I see Tom tomorrow.
How much water does it take to fill your swimming pool?
Tom said Mary is probably still grouchy.
Tom said that he thought that Mary would unlikely want to do that.
Tom said he'd come, but he never showed up.
I doubt that Tom has the courage to do what really needs to be done.
Tom says he doesn't believe Mary really plans to do that this week.
Tom will be able to do that eventually.
The doctor advised me to leave jogging because it was excessive exercise.
Tom said he wasn't ready, but Mary said she was.
I don't think Tom will be back.
Nobody was on the bus.
Tom said he hoped Mary could win.
Tom thought he had lost his wallet, but eventually found it after searching the house for an hour or so.
Tom told me he wasn't impressed.
I didn't think anyone really expected you to be here.
It was clear Tom hadn't done that yet.
Tom and Mary are planning to go to every bar on this street.
Tom said he thought I might have to do that soon.
Did you know your socks don't match?
You know that's gotta be done today, don't you?
I think Tom's about to start crying.
She took him by the arm.
Tom said he felt intimidated.
It's not worth the effort.
Someone's waiting in your office.
I'm sorry we dragged you into this.
Tom said he's not thirsty.
Tom told me Mary did that wrong.
I knew Tom might get hurt if he tried to do that.
Isn't that what you would have done?
Tom told me he thought Mary would be courteous.
I guess that's not really important.
Why is Tom wearing a cape?
Tom said Mary was able to do that too.
That's a mistake a lot of people make.
I don't think I'll be in Australia next week.
I know Tom didn't know I couldn't do that.
I know Tom's a lot younger than Mary is.
It's not an easy solution.
Tom said his mother never loved him.
Tom should have stayed longer.
Tom knows he's in real trouble now.
There is no doubt that Tom will do that for us.
I don't have anything I need to say to Tom.
I don't think Tom knows what I'm planning to do.
The men wear short sleeves.
Tom said he'd take care of Mary.
I knew that eventually this would happen.
It's not hard to guess what's going to happen.
Tom will never hurt anyone.
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not be required to do that by himself.
I thought everyone knew.
I'm afraid I don't know.
Beauty lies in the eyes of the one who sees.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would be amused by what was happening.
Tom said he'd be home for dinner.
It's not a secret anymore.
Tom told me he didn't know Mary.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
Tom thought Mary was John's girlfriend.
I can't stand this noise.
I know Tom's a lot better at doing that than Mary.
The police believe Tom and Mary were murdered.
I guarantee that's not going to happen.
Tom claims he was born in 2013.
I don't think Tom's tough.
Tom has decided that he will say yes.
I hope Tom isn't dead.
They said they don't.
Tom knows this is a difficult situation.
Tom knew that what he was going to do would make Mary angry.
Tom could have done that without Mary's help.
Tom thought he might not be required to do that.
Tom asked Mary if John was planning to stay.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be mad.
Tom said Mary was willing to do the cooking.
I hope I don't start crying.
You should have done that with us.
I don't think it's impossible.
I know Tom's a pretty good swimmer.
Tom hasn't been appointed chairman yet.
I wonder if there's any cheese left in the refrigerator.
What are you good at?
I wonder if Tom and Mary were supposed to do that.
Tom said he didn't have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want to work late.
I suspect Tom and Mary both have houses in Australia.
Tom said he thought Mary was the only one who had to do that.
Tom said he was hoping you'd win.
I think Tom and Mary are both gonna get fired.
I thought it was your job.
Tom told me John was a terrible roommate.
I wonder if Tom is reliable.
I think Tom will do that too.
I knew Tom was studying.
I know Tom's a gun owner.
It will take me 20 minutes to get to the station by taxi.
No one's done it yet.
Tom said he didn't want me to worry.
I know Tom will be doing that with me this afternoon.
We're not planning to do that together.
Let's see why your answers differ from mine.
They told me they disagreed.
I don't think Tom was upset.
Tom knows he should, but he doesn't want to.
Tom is also a member of our group.
My parents won't let me do that.
They told me they didn't win.
Tom said he wasn't having fun.
I think Tom was in love with Mary.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
They say they like marigolds.
"Is everybody talking about me?" "No, Tom, you're not that important."
I don't think it's gonna be hard to do that.
It's not something I'm proud of.
Are both Tom and Mary still sick?
I can't believe you did that.
I knew Tom wasn't done that yet.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom should go home.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be alone.
I promise I won't hit anyone.
Tom said he'd try to do that today.
Tom and Mary used to live on Park Street.
I know Tom knows that Mary should do that.
Tom said he felt much happier now.
Tom said he doesn't even want to think about it.
The joke's on you.
I'm determined to give up smoking.
I thought maybe I shouldn't go home right away.
Tom told me he liked snow.
Tom and Mary should never have done that together.
Every man can't be happy.
I promise I won't do that.
Tom said he hopes Mary likes to do that.
I swear I'll tell you everything someday.
Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often, the oath is taken in the midst of gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in the high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our predecessors, and true to our founding documents.
Tom didn't know Mary had gone to Boston.
I was the only one there who knew Tom wanted to do that.
Tom says he intends to win.
I know that Tom seldom does that anymore.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still alone.
I don't think I'd like to do that outside in the winter.
The rumour quickly spread.
There's no way you're going out dressed like that.
If we don't take the threat of meteor strikes seriously, we'll all die.
You're embarrassing.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary has to do that tomorrow.
It's not that weird, is it?
I didn't know I was violating any laws.
You promise me you'll do that?
You should tell Tom he's not likely to win.
They say they're willing to help.
There's a chance it's real.
I know I did the right thing.
Tom says he despises Mary.
I suspect Tom is in there.
I knew Tom was a pretty good jazz saxophone player, and that's why I wanted him to join our band.
I think Tom's trying to trick us.
Tom said he wished he hadn't forgotten to buy a birthday present for Mary.
Tom probably can't do that any faster than Mary can.

I don't think Tom was excited.
I suspect Tom is likely to do that tomorrow.
I think Tom's still depressed.
Tom said he never agreed to do that.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's in the hospital.
I must have overlooked something.

What's Tom's problem?
I know Tom would be happy to do that.
Tom didn't know Mary was supposed to help John do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was healthy.
It's not you, it's me!
I thought you were going to stay with Tom.
I don't think Tom's involved.
Tom said he's not planning to do that on his own.
Tom said that Mary thought that he might want to do that this evening.
I thought Tom had already been compensated for that.
I promise you I will be there to help you.
Tom said he didn't think I looked like I was enjoying myself.
There's no reason Tom wouldn't want to do that.
Tom said he'd try.
Tom said he was planning to stay in Australia next summer.
There's a chance Tom was wrong.
I'm fat.
I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary not to do that anymore.
Tom told me he needed space.
Let's go to the beach.
Tom seems to have many friends.
Tom may not have enough money to buy what he needs.
Tom said he's not sure Mary can do that.
Tom should really have eaten more for breakfast.
Tom and Mary told me they were terrified.
Tom told Mary he was happy.
Tom said he was tired of waiting.
Why do you suspect Tom was the one who did that?
Tom said he had fun hanging out with us.
The earthquake smashed everything.
I knew we should have brought more food with us.
They put on their bathing suits.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary has to do that today.
I'm sorry I made you so unhappy.
I don't think Tom has much experience doing that.

Tom said he thought Mary could do that.
I didn't know you weren't planning to do that on your own.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary shouldn't be doing that.
I know Tom is a selfish person.
Mary says she's not planning on going.
Are you planning to do that?
I'm sorry Tom had to leave so early.
I was hoping you'd tell me everything yourself.
There's nothing to apologize for.
I'd rather go swimming.
I've been planning on doing that for months.
I'm sorry I was so slow.
Tom and Mary said they didn't eat meat anymore.
I'm surprised Tom won.
It's possible.

Please come in.
I don't think that's gonna happen anymore.
Tom said that Mary thought he was the only one who knew how to do that.
Tom couldn't find what he was looking for.
I didn't know you'd be nervous.
I know you don't like me, but we have to work together.
I know you should do that.
I was surprised Tom didn't come yesterday.
A true friend would have helped.
I know Tom will love it.
Tom told me that he thought I should lose some weight.
Tom said he'd rather do that next week.
I think Tom is prejudiced.
I thought it was a mistake to tell Tom where we buried the treasure.
I haven't called back yet.
Tom said Mary didn't look much older than John.
Tom's probably a little younger than I am.
You're out of danger.
It's not worth repairing this camera.
I know that's not the truth.
They promised that they would do that this week.
I don't think I've ever been so hungry before.
I knew Tom would help Mary do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't accept our offer.
Tom said he thought he'd be able to help us today.
Tom knew what he was doing was wrong, but he did it anyway.

My mother was sick, I couldn't go to the concert.
Tom said that Mary thought that John might want to do that this evening.
Tom and Mary said they were very sad.
I don't think my vote will change anything.
Tom's back on the junk.
What makes you think it was Tom who did this?
We both agreed with Tom.
I know Tom won't have to do that by himself.
I know Tom's not a very reasonable man.

That's something I should have done a long time ago.
I didn't know Tom had only one leg.
Hello again.
The show is on Wednesday.
I'm home right now.
I soon found out that I wasn't talented enough.
I don't think anyone suspected you weren't really Tom.
Go away and leave me alone!
You should tell Tom that Mary is planning to do that.
It is not always easy to tell the difference between good and bad.
Tom's even lazier than Mary.
That's not funny.
I don't think anyone could have stopped Tom.
Tom didn't think he had a chance to succeed, but at least he wanted to give it a shot.
I suspect Tom has already left for Australia.
They told me they had been sick.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did.
I don't think I can do that tonight.
Tom told me he thought Mary was next.
Tom and Mary put down their spoons.
What will the neighbors think?
Tom said he hopes you try your best to win.
How did you know I needed to do that?
Tom has already asked me not to do that.
Tom said he wish he hadn't told Mary that he would do that.
Tom said he wouldn't do that.
Tom said he thought Mary was in her room listening to music.
I don't think that's realistic.

Tom should have known this.
I know Tom doesn't know that I don't want to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary could play the saxophone.
I don't think I can love two people at the same time.
Tom said he thought I was creative.
There is a serious problem.
I wonder if I should do that.

I don't think there's any reason Tom has to do that.
Tom's good at his job.
Tom said Mary often does that.
Rape survivors are more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder than survivors of other traumatic experiences.

I think Tom's alone in his room.

Send him to me!
Tom said he didn't plan to go this week.
Do you do the same with your kids?

Tom and Mary say they can't do that.
He's got to see a specialist.
I knew that would happen.
I know Tom's in Australia now.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary knows how to do that very well.
I didn't think Tom would be worried about something like that.
Is this the first time you've ever given blood?
Have you had tea?
Tom was unable to find Mary a good job.
My bike has a flat tyre.
I know Tom was shaken.
Good night!
It's all gonna be okay.
Tom is convinced that everyone hates him.
I know Tom will do that for you.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
They say they didn't have to do that.

I thought you said it was getting fixed.
He respects you.

You should let Tom know that you can't do that.
I thought Tom would be safe here.
Tom thought Mary might not be allowed to do that anymore.
No one answered my questions.
Tom told me he wasn't planning to do that.
I think Tom could have come home by himself.
You should have seen me.
It was a prophet of God.
Doing that won't be as hard as you think.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still home sick.
I'm surprised Tom remembers me.
If you had asked for my advice, I would have advised you not to do that.
Tom said he didn't want to hang out with Mary anymore.
Tom thought Mary might not have to do that anymore.
I didn't know Tom should do that.
They're surprised.
I like foreign languages!
What have you been watching?
Tom told me he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Tom said he thought it would be better not to go outside.
It may not be as hard to do as you think it will be.
We're in the same time zone.
I thought you knew both Tom and Mary were allergic to peanuts.
They knew they wouldn't win.
Tom and Mary said they agreed to do that.
It's a beautiful day!
You are more than welcome to come over.

I think Tom stays at his grandparents' house whenever he visits Boston.
I don't think Tom wants to do that anymore.

I don't think Tom wants to go to Boston with you.
I think Tom's careless.
I think Tom should wait until at least 2:30 before he leaves.
I thought Tom would be present at today's meeting.

That would have been the smart thing to do.
I think Tom will listen to me.
I could have sworn something moved.

I didn't think anyone could have stopped Tom.
I want to know if Tom and Mary need to do that too.
I suspect Tom and Mary are exhausted.
The world is not as scary as you think.
I think Tom's gone.
I know you don't want to do that, but you have to.
Let's hope that's enough time.
Tom is one of the uglyst people I know.
I'm very glad to see you.
I didn't think anyone suspected you were not Tom.
Put your socks on fast, we're late.
Tom told everyone he was starving.
Tom told me he knew how to speak French.
I'm absolutely sure Tom's wrong.
I thought I'd give it another try.

Tom told me he thought Mary was unbiased.
I don't think you should have left early.
Tom said Mary wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might not be allowed to do that anymore.
I had no idea you knew Tom.
We will discuss this problem later.
I don't think Tom has anyone to help him.
How's it going?
Tom thinks he can do whatever he wants.
I know I can't do that as well as Tom can.
I know Tom's planning on doing that tomorrow.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be interested.
It is not very hot today.
I wasn't as successful as Tom.
Tom said he didn't think he could do that kind of thing.
If you don't go, I won't either.
What are your plans?
Tom and Mary say they're not ready to go.
I know Tom doesn't know I shouldn't do that.
Tom thought Mary didn't like him.
Tom said he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he already did that.
I think you're gonna be okay.
I knew Tom was still willing to do that.
Tom told Mary that he was glad that it had happened.
The computer has stopped working.
We know you're not stupid.
She didn't turn up after all.
We both know that's a lie.
Tom knows we're not supposed to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be awake at this time of night.
I didn't think Tom would be stupid enough to do something like that.
I don't think Tom's in Australia now.
I don't think Tom knows exactly what he should be doing.
Tom and Mary can do that.
I thought you might know.
Tom's flawed.
It's not always easy to face reality.
Tom says he won't win.
Tom was aware that they were following him.
What the hell was that supposed to mean?
I know I'm in big trouble now.
Why don't you ever do what I tell you to do?
Tom decided the best thing was to let Mary go to Australia.
Tom would never have done that if Mary had asked him not to.
I thought you said you weren't interested.
It was harder to do that than Tom said it would be.
I don't think Tom will be going to Australia with Mary.
I'm so tired.
I'm 18 years old.
They're not coming.
Tom probably doesn't know the rules yet.
Let's hope you're cured.
I know someone should do that.
I can't speak French as well as you.
You should have listened to Tom more carefully.
Tom said I should let you drive.
What's your favorite fast-food restaurant?
Why is Tom wearing that hat?
Tom said he didn't want to wear John's old clothes.
I don't think we could do that.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that.
The clock has stopped.
Tom and I both grew up in Boston.
Tom said he was an artist.
I don't think Tom will be back soon.
I didn't think we had enough money.
I shouted as loud as I could.
I'm giving you what you want.
I knew Tom was expecting Mary to do that for him.
I know Tom's a good writer.
They said they would never want to do that.
They said they'd eat fruit.
Tom said he didn't have to do that now.
I thought you wouldn't like Boston.
I think there's a good chance it'll rain tonight.
I love you and I always will.
No. No.
I know Tom's not a very good hiter.
I don't think I'm the best person for the job.
They say they would be willing to help us.
It's not open for debate.
Tom told everyone he was unemployed.
I know it's gonna be hard to do.
How are you planning to do that?
It's beyond me.
I'm a little out of shape!
Didn't you know Tom was seeing someone else?
It's gonna be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I should have been more careful.
Tom and Mary thought they were being cute.
I thought you'd learned that right now.
I never said I could understand French.
Tom's just as smart as Mary.
They wish they hadn't said that.
I wonder if Tom is planning to quit his job.
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be motivated to do that.
I'm going crazy.
Tom thought Mary would be embarrassed.
I hope I get a chance to go to Boston.
I'm glad nobody's around.
Tom said he hoped Mary would like the gift he was planning to give her.
I don't think we have a choice.
Tom couldn't defend himself.
Do what Tom tells you to do.
Saturday is the last day of the week.
I know Tom will probably know how to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be grumpy.
I know Tom knows why we didn't do that on Monday.
Who's your favorite singer?
I promise you I'll help you.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not want to do that again.
Tom thinks he left his paraply on the train.
I'm much taller than Tom.
I know Tom can speak French. I wonder if Mary can, too.
I know Tom would be quicker to do that than Mary.
My handwriting is better than Tom's.
Hello, what's your name?
They say they won't be here tomorrow.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I assume this is because Tom is a minor.
I always suspected Tom was a little paranoid.
I know Tom knew I was planning to do that.
You should have been able to do that much better.
We work every day but Monday.
I know you weren't the ones who did that.
Tom said he doesn't have the power to stop it.
I know Tom and Mary are married.
I should have been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited I was getting married.
Tom told me he'd probably cry.
I thought they'd find someone else.
I was the only one there who knew Tom didn't want to do that.
I very seriously doubt that Tom did that with purpose.
I thought you might be busy now.
Tom said he thought that we should do that on our own.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me very much.
I thought it was unnecessary for us to do anything about that today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something the other night about that.
Tom admitted he wasn't brave.
I know I should have done that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
I suspect Tom is waiting for us.
Dogs who are dead can't bite.
I don't think Tom's as crazy as some people think.
I don't think I'll be able to do that by myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
She avoided his eyes.
Tom's not as fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do that by ourselves.
Tom says Mary's still planning to do that.
I thought Tom had to be mistaken.
Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
They said they didn't like this.
Tom was the reason Mary moved to Boston.
I should have introduced myself.
Tom said Mary is looking forward to being retired.
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
I've never fallen in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about that.
Tom's liked by everyone.
I didn't think anyone thought you were crazy.
He doesn't have a mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that by himself.
There's no need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I suspect Tom is involved.
How many pounds have you lost?
Tom and Mary are all right.
I'm a despisable human being.
I'll never forget the time you and I went to Australia together.
Tom's not the only one who's planning to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary have both decided not to leave.
Tom told me he's sleepy.
Mary tried on her mother's clothes.
Tom admitted he stole Mary's bike.
I shaving off the lid.
Tom said Mary was likely to be in Australia now.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you are.
When's your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's obvious Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I would have helped you.
I didn't know Tom and Mary were already married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you had fun doing that.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been on a diet for more than a year.
Tom said he wasn't willing to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary already had a driver's license.
I know Tom's a pretty good drummer.
Tom realized he wouldn't be able to change anything.
Tom said Mary should have done that alone.
I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy a weather habit.
Didn't you know Tom was a Canadian?
Come on, guys, this isn't funny anymore.
I suspect Tom is home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they'd do that again.
Tom threw up.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy being married to Tom.
I didn't know there was a swimming pool here.
Tom and Mary say they're not concerned.
Tom didn't stay in Boston for as long as he wanted.
Tom said he's a Canadian.
I'd like another cup of coffee.
I assume Tom is still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone he knows enjoys doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know Tom can probably do that sometime today.
Do you let your children play in the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom doubts that Mary can do that.
There's a cat under the desk.
I think Tom is unkind.
I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
Is it true Tom is moving to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you looked tired.
Tom said I looked impatient.
I think Tom could make Mary do that.
I'm interested in chess these days.
I don't think I'd like to live in Australia.
Tom said Mary should have done that by herself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was misled.
What you're saying is absolutely wrong.
He's depressed.
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary's thirsty.
They said they didn't enjoy doing that.
I'm peeling apples.
They said they would never study French.
They said they thought I was creative.
Tom told me he's not sure what to do.
Tom told me I should have said yes.
Tom didn't press the button.
There was nothing left in the fridge.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not have to do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't probably have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know Mary couldn't speak French very well.
I don't think there's a chance I'll get there in time.
I think both Tom and Mary are going to be busy tomorrow.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he's not planning on going with us this weekend.
I don't think Tom is sure that's what Mary wants to do.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everyone loves free stuff.
I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does that, I will, too.
I know Tom's still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they're ready to help me.
Tom wasn't the one who told me that Mary should do that.
I thought you said you'd still like to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary wanted to do that or not.
They say they're not planning to go.
Tom's a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that.
Tom said it was Mary who told him that he should do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary's upset.
I don't think I can hold on much longer.
Tom's not as tall as Mary.
Tom said he didn't think the heat bothered Mary.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom I disagreed.
I think Tom's talking to Mary now.
I've already promised Tom I'd help him.
I think everyone deserves a chance.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to be at the meeting.
Tom doesn't know I have to do that today.
I don't think you really want to call attention to that.
Tom said he knew Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to kill John.
Leave the lights on, please.
Tom said Australia is a nice place to visit.
I thought Tom was in big trouble.
I listened to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech lasted three hours.
I wonder if Tom's alive.
I might try to borrow a hat from Tom.
Tom may be surprised.
I don't think anyone would want to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know someone cares.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in Australia very long.
Tom told Mary he'd never come back here.
I didn't know you couldn't do that on your own.
I suspect Tom will never agree to do that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom is irresponsible.
I thought it would be fun living in Australia for a year or two.
I know Tom is more likely to do that today than he was yesterday.
I think Tom is doing something illegal.
Our streets flood when we have rain.
I'll probably be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have much choice.
Tom said he thought he might do that on October 20th.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that.
I knew Tom might be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
I know Tom is a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Everyone here except Tom has done that.
I think you should do it yourself.
I think everyone has an idea of what Tom is capable of.
Tom knew he could have done that better.
Tom said he wished Mary wouldn't do that by himself anymore.
Tom told me he thought Mary was displeased.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I'm a university student.
I don't think Tom did that, but I could be wrong.
Which country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I've made enough spaghetti for everyone.
I know Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she needs to do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do that alone.
Are you saying you don't want to do this?
I know Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that's not going to happen.
Tom's planning to sit in the back.
Tom said he had given a book to Mary.
It would have been unbearable.
I know Tom will probably know how to do that.
I know Tom was a scrawny kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're partly blamed.
I'm not surprised Tom's plans to do that.
Hardly anyone expected Tom to win.
Don't twist my words!
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job was going to be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put on your jacket if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to stay in Australia very long.
I hear you've given up smoking.
Tom obviously doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes doing that much.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me he was next.
Tom said that Mary knew that John might have to do that by himself.
Tom said he was good at speaking French.
This is not salt.
Has anyone here seen Tom?
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room I do.
He didn't keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he's planning to do that.
I suspect Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know Tom can speak French better than I can.
I suspect Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-defense.
Tom told me he thought Mary had been careful.
Tom was asleep on the living room sofa.
I found out both Tom and Mary like romantic novels.
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday.
I suspect Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Tom told everyone that he was prepared to do that.
We'll go on a picnic if it's okay tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone
It's not Tom who needs protection, it's Mary.
They said they're irritated.
I think Tom will probably be able to do that.
Tom did that whenever he could.
They said their houses weren't for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I wouldn't be able to do that.
I think we have more important things we should be doing now.
I think Tom and Mary have been to Boston at least once.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew Mary was a teacher.
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be sleepy.
Can someone help me?
I know Tom's about the same age as your daughter.
I know Tom's a very lucky guy.
Tom thought I might not be allowed to do that by myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's easy to go.
I think Tom will be lonely.
It seems Tom likes everyone.
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary has to settle in her new flat.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom you plan to do that.
They swore they'd never done that.
Everybody stood there, shocked.
I'm looking forward to hearing why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
I regret I wasn't as careful as I should have been.
Tom doesn't look too good.
Tom said he thought I should do that by myself.
I don't think Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard noises in the kitchen.
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary is sleepy or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised that I did that, weren't you?
They wished they could fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I've seen Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know the bridge was closed.
They said they don't like that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary right now.
Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
You shouldn't just assume Tom's guilty.
Watch yourselves.
Mary said she wasn't planning to do that.
Someone has to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know Tom did that when he was thirteen.
Tom said he doesn't think you can win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said I was the only one who thanked him.
Enough is enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I needed to do that.
Did you know Tom did that?
I guess it's like that everywhere.
Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It is not until you have lost your health that you realize its value.
That could have hit me.
They told me they're losing weight.
My house's not big.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know I was still planning to join the team, did you?
The bathroom was not very clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said he didn't think he'd ever be able to convince Mary to go out with him.
Tom thought Mary would be the first to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ambitious.
This is something I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this kind of music.
Tom said he thought he could do that if he had any help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She's been sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wished he could speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom has no prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know Tom knew I was the one who had to do that.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I've left my umbrella in the phone booth.
I did a bad thing.
I suspect Tom would be interested in doing that.
I've promised Tom I'd do that.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's too good to be true.
Tom said to do that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to be obedient.
Courgettes are green.
I should never have broken up with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia right now.
Tom knew I'd be early.
Tom threw his dog some bread.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that.
That's just not possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm pretty sure I can do that.
Tom says he and Mary will spend Christmas Day together.
Why did you fail in the entrance examination?
Tom found it hard to remain impartial.
Tom told me he had to leave.
Tom says he can't prove Mary did that.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were bored.
Tom said he's glad you're coming.
Tom thought Mary was really mean.
I know there will be a lot of good food at the picnic.
Does anyone have any questions so far?
I suspect Tom is reluctant to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anyone.
They said they'd rather come next week.
What are you referring to?
Tom said he thought Mary was having fun of what was going on.
Everyone in the room did the same thing.
They're inseparable.
Tom didn't know you were the one who wanted to do that.
They promised they wouldn't do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must have done that last year.
Could you take a picture of me?
We should've expected that to happen.
It would have been wise to do that.
Tom told me he doesn't have a problem with that.
Tom said Mary shouldn't have walked home by herself.
Tom has to be irritated.
For how long has your head been hurting?
Thank you, bud!
Tom said no one was fired.
Do you think we should have gone to where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here?
He's got earache.
I don't think Tom wants to do that on his own.
I'm not sure I can trust Tom.
Tom said it was Mary who told him he needed to do that.
Tom was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
I'm assuming that the gunshot I heard was the one that killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me he thought Mary was high.
I know Tom's a millionaire.
Tom said he thought it would be safe to do that.
I don't think I'll let Tom do that.
No pain, no gain.
I admit I've done that.
I don't think Tom eats meat.
I hope we don't have any problems with Tom.
Here's your bag.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about the noise.
I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom's a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unethical for you to do that.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I know we can't count on Tom to do that for us.
I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago.
I don't think Tom's gonna be the last one to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom's downstairs.
I need to know that we can depend on Tom.
Tom said Mary thought he might not be allowed to do that.
I realize that's not very likely to happen.
They say that drugs are not safe.
I know it's highly unlikely anyone can help me.
I think Tom's gonna call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitious person.
Tom said he thought it would be a huge mistake to tell Mary what had happened.
Tom thought Mary would probably not cry.
This work is enough to break my back.
That would never have happened if you had done what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water heater.
Does anyone have a cloenex?
Tom told us that he thought he could become a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom's a haemophilia.
I wouldn't have said anything.
Tom said he'd be happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said he knew you could do that.
Tom and I are both wrong.
I assume you still enjoy drinking beer.
I wonder if Tom and Mary could do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom is the person you should be talking to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said I had to study French.
You're not obliged to do that, are you?
You got a big head.
He's very smart.
I would never have hired Tom.
Does Tom know that you've already done that?
Tom ate more than I ate.
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last Monday.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.
Tom said Mary is probably still willing to do that.
Did anyone go to Australia with you?
Tom said he thought that I would want to do that.
Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do that.
I hope this is enough food for everyone.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early anymore.
I know Tom knows that Mary will never be able to do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary are going to get hurt if they're not careful.
Tom would have done that.
I didn't know Tom told Mary he wasn't gonna do that.
I'd like to visit Boston again.
By teaching and studying my time is taken up.
I think Tom's conceited.
I don't think Tom would like it if we did that.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary won't be able to do that.
They say they'll stop doing that.
Tom's incompetent.
Tom thinks Mary drinks like a fish.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary.
Tom and Mary said they told you.
Tom said he thinks Mary can't do that.
I know Tom's a golfer, maybe he could teach you how to play.
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
I knew Tom would be able to do that without any help.
I suggest you don't go to Australia in the winter.
What else are you planning to do?
I think Tom understood everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom's talking.
It's not my business.
Mary has a big postcard collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're willing to help.
I assume you'd like to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary got back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary good night last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew Tom wasn't a bad student.
It's unlikely Tom will do that.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the campsite?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should have quit while I was ahead.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
My grandmother texts faster than you.
Do both Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you'd do that for Tom.
I didn't think anyone noticed what you did.
I wonder if I could help Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one here who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know this isn't hard.
I suspect Tom and Mary are not ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I assumed Tom had told you I'd be here.
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia all week?
Tom said he didn't know that eventually Mary was going to leave him.
You're not still afraid, are you?
I thought you'd cry.
The value of health cannot be overestimated.
You'll suffer because of that.
I don't think Tom knows exactly how much it's gonna cost.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know Tom's nice.
Tom already knows Mary's planning to do that.
Don't take off your gloves.
Keep it up!
Tom said he wouldn't do that again.
Tom should have been able to show you how to do that.
Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary was feeling sick.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unfriendly.
Put your pants on.
They said they weren't ready to talk.
I know Tom isn't the one who's supposed to do that.
I admit I have despised Tom since the first time I met him.
Is there a lot of Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the TV guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty.
It is true that the earth is round.
Tom couldn't help smiling.
Tom doesn't like people to know that he can't speak French well.
Look at that girl.
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be disabled.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
Tom thinks that's a mistake.
I knew Tom was a reasonable guy.
Tom thought Mary was downstairs.
I didn't want to admit I couldn't do that.
Tom said he was ready to do whatever was necessary.
Tom said he owes Mary a lot of money.
Tom said he thought I was creative.
I'm sorry, but I can't eat dinner with you.
It's not safe to go out after dark by yourself.
Did you know Tom had a son?
Tom knows Mary likes Boston.
Tom and Mary said they're not likely to win.
Tom told me he had been forgiven.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that tomorrow.
Tom knows there's only one course of action possible.
Tom and Mary said they tried very hard to win.
They say they lost their keys.
I've decided never to do that again.
I didn't know you were dating Tom.
I think Tom hasn't made a decision yet.
I know you still want to do that.
Please tell Tom and Mary they're not required to do that.
Good job, guys!
I know Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to be doing that today.
Tom and Mary say they didn't want to do that.
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year.
Don't you know everyone's talking about us?
Tom said that Mary knew he didn't want to do that until next Monday.
I know Tom's house is for sale.
I don't think Tom's sad.
I don't think Tom really will win.
I would have wanted to do that with you.
I'm not interested in sex.
Tom told everyone he was determined to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was strict.
Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that by herself.
We wish we could have done more to help.
Tom said he thought it would snow tonight.
I promised Tom I'd be home early.
Tom said he'd look at it.
Tom said it was more difficult than he thought it would be.
You would've loved the movie.
They told me they don't really care what happens.
Tom's speech wasn't as long as Mary's.
I didn't know Tom would be willing to show me how to do that.
I'm sorry I bothered you.
Everyone seems to be afraid but you.
Tom was afraid his parents would start asking him questions and that he would end up telling them everything.
Was the book you were reading yesterday in French?
I'm a damage doer.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
You could've gone.
Tom said he didn't think the smell bothered Mary.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
I thought you were a better chess player than this.
I'm glad to see Tom's happy again.
I thought Tom had already left.
I knew Tom wouldn't be able to keep Mary from doing that.
I don't think we have much time.
Tom said he's trying to hide Mary.
I don't think Tom would have done that for me.
Tom's the funnyst person I've ever met.
I doubt Tom really plans to do that.
Tom said he thought that Mary might not have to do that this week.
I know Tom knows he didn't have to do that.
To tell the truth, I'm not your father.
I don't think Tom will be doing that with Mary.
That's the real reason Tom ran away from home, isn't it?
I thought you might walk Mary home.
Tom said he hopes that Mary will try to do that.
You like chocolate, don't you?
I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning.

I think Tom was the one who wanted to do that.
I suspect that's not going to happen.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are really telling the truth.
Do you all think this is a good idea?

I don't think anyone can do this.
Did you know Tom and Mary were still planning to do that?
Tom told me he thought Mary was too young to drive.
I'll come back.
I don't think Tom's nosy.
I would never have done that.

I didn't think anyone could do this.
How do we know you're not lying to us?
I think you'd all agree with Tom is one of our best singers.
Tom didn't know Mary was in pain.
I would have gone to Boston if I could.

Tom said he wouldn't walk home today.
Most people think they're above average.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ticklish.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be gone by the time we get there.
He went to America last year to brush up his English.
Tom said Mary probably won't do that.
Tom will unlikely want to do that on a day like this.
Tom never mentioned he had a girlfriend.
I knew Tom wasn't a very good singer.

I wish I had gone to Australia with Tom.
You're not answering me.
I didn't think Tom would help me do that.
Tom and Mary need this.
Tom thought Mary probably did that.

Do Tom and Mary know you've done that?
Maybe Tom doesn't know Mary has to do that.
Tom thinks I'm a loser.
Tom knows that he should do that soon.

Leave the dog outside!

It must have been a shock to you.
Tom and I were both wrong.
All our blood goes through our kidneys about sixty times a day.
I don't think that doing that is a bad idea.
She pressed her nose against the glass.
I don't think anyone really thought Tom was happy.
We should have gone to Boston last month.
Tom should do that somewhere else.

Tom has a car, but he rarely uses it.
Let's go out for some frame.

I'm very worried about my future.
How could anyone do that to a child?
I know Tom knows we don't have to do that.
I know Tom doesn't know why he has to do that by himself.
That is not exactly the way it happened.
They told me they were sure.

My heart is painful.

Who did this by?
I knew Tom would be annoyed if you did that.
They claimed they didn't cry.
You know Tom is very unlikely to do that, don't you?

You know Tom's a doctor, don't you?
I didn't want to admit that I was the one who broke the window.
Tom said he was expecting Mary to be there.
You're not leaving Japan for good, are you?
I wonder if Tom really is going to do that today.
How did you know I was going to say that?
I don't think Tom knows anyone in Boston.
Does Tom really think Mary enjoys doing that?
I haven't eaten anything for the last three days.
I thought you said no one would be here.
We haven't been told yet.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't be interested in doing that.
Mary says she's not planning to do that this week.

She's my favorite character.
Tom said he knew you couldn't do that.
They said they didn't want to leave.
I wish I could speak English as fluently as you!

I don't think Tom knows if Mary likes him or not.
I'm not sure Tom would want me to give you that.
I wish we hadn't gone to Australia.
They say that they want to do that too.
Tom and Mary took off their gloves.
We're apt to make mistakes.
I know Tom didn't know exactly how to do that.
Tom said that didn't sound logical to him.
They told everyone they were lonely.
We have to escape this place.
Tom would have liked to be here.
You should have worked harder.
I'm surprised Tom didn't show.
I wonder if or not Tom knew that Mary couldn't do that.
I'm afraid I was spilling coffee on the tablecloth.
Tom told everyone he was fine.
I'm sure Tom would do that if you asked him.
I don't think Tom knows how much time it's gonna take.
Tom thinks Mary lacks common sense.

We really need more American hose on Tatoeba, stat!

I know Tom would have done that for me.
I don't think the weather will clear up anytime soon.
Tom and I both like swimming.
Tom said he didn't want to go to the dance with Mary.
Tom said the pain started three months ago.
Tom told me he was hoping Mary would be gone by the time we get there.
Tom pretended he didn't notice Mary staring at him.
Tom thought he had to help Mary.
I'm going to New York next week.
This is an unusually difficult language.
They realized that they needed to do that.
I'm sure Tom needs to do that again.
Tom must have been tortured.
Last night I puked.
Everyone here except me has done that.
Tom's almost as tall as Mary is.
Tom told me he thought Mary was upset.
We need to protect our children.

What are you gonna do with all that money?
Why are you planning to do that?

Wonderful!
We're sorry it happened.
I didn't notice Tom was doing that.
Tom's about three years older than Mary.
It's important that we do that correctly.
I think Tom's just pretending to be asleep.
I promise I won't cry.

I always knew Tom could win.
You're welcome.
Tom showed me his stamp collection.
We're here.

What you said doesn't make sense.
They told me they'll join us later.
I suspect Tom and Mary are going to hate this.
Tom said he wished Mary and I wouldn't go out after dark by ourselves.
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
They told me they'll be back soon.

Someone's waiting for us in the lobby.
I knew Tom was planning to tell Mary to do that.
I've lost three kilos.
The same thing must have happened to Tom.

Tom didn't read everything as carefully as he should.
We know Tom is unlikely to do that.
I knew Tom went to this school.
I'm afraid we'll have to start over again.
I'm so sorry this has happened.
That is an interesting claim.
You weren't surprised that I didn't have to do that, were you?
I am familiar with this subject.
I don't think anyone really thought Tom was as rich as he said he was.
She's not old enough to get a driver's license.

It's not worth much.
This is really hard.
Tom's gonna be surprised if you don't.
Tom knew Mary was with John.
I promise I'll be back soon.
Tom said Mary shouldn't have stayed at the party so long.
They put their boots on.
I thought you came to see Tom.
This should have been done a long time ago.

Tom thought he forgot to tell Mary what to do.

I thought you said you'd rather do that yourself.
Tom said he thought Mary would be scared.
Tom doesn't want Mary to know that he doesn't know how to do that.

Call me!
You should have told Tom how you felt.
We will consider your suggestion.
Eating too much is bad for health.
The paint's drying.

Tom's miserable.
Didn't you know there was a good chance this would happen?
I wonder if Tom will be at Mary's party tonight.

Is it true that Tom tried to hang himself?
Who are you calling stupid?!
I'm calling my brother.

We don't believe that's true.
This is a song I learned when I was a kid.
The road is long.
Tom's a good carpenter.

It's unfortunate that happened.
Tom told me he thought Mary was downstairs.

This man is not my husband.
Tom said he didn't believe that.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't want me to do that.
Tom must have been very tired when he got home.
I'm pretty sure Tom can't speak French.
There's no chance Tom will help us.
I don't think you can eat that.
Tom said he'd try to do that.
I thought it was funny.
Tom works at a store not too far from where he lives.
I thought you said you didn't want to talk about it.
I don't know anyone there except for Tom.
Tom told me that he was quicker to do that than Mary.
I don't think Tom's still upset.
Tom told me he thought Mary had been fired.
It's not a bad plan.
Did Tom know you were planning to do that?
Tom convinced me you were the best person for the job.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't do that for him.
That water's not cold.
I think Tom stayed in Boston last summer.
How anyone could vote for someone like that is beyond me.
They said they were busy.
I know Tom's in his room packing his suitcase.
Do you really think you can convince Tom to buy you that?
I don't think anyone saw us do that.
Tom said you speak French.
I should've gone to the dentist last week.
They told me they're shy.
I don't think Tom's adopted.
I swear I'm not high.

I know Tom and Mary have both been sick.
I can't understand why anyone would want to do that.

They still hope that they can do that.
Tom said he jumped out of the way.
"Was anyone with you?" "No, I was alone."
Don't pretend you're sorry, I know you're not.
Tom told everyone he was reluctant to do that.
This box is pretty heavy!
I thought you said you wanted to go to Boston.
I met someone yesterday who knows Tom.
I know you can't get away with this.
Whenever someone knocks on the door, my dog starts barking.
Both Tom and Mary have the same problem.
There's no way you can do that on your own.
I'm afraid something's wrong with Tom.
The bill was hard to calculate.
I want to know who's coming with us.
I've never met anyone like you before.
It would have been hard to do that.
Tom may be ready to do that.
Tom will try to help Mary do that.
It could have been worse.
Tom thinks that doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
I'm sorry I didn't tell Tom the truth.
Tom and I both didn't go to yesterday's meeting.
Why didn't you come to the party?
Do you think Tom's already retired?

Tom said he'd retire next October.
I didn't know Tom played the trumpet.

There's no way I'm gonna let you do that.
Tom told everyone he was lonely.
I wonder if Tom's still busy.
What is the name of our CEO?
I know you're worried about Tom.
I thought I did pretty well.
Tom admitted he was troubled.
Nobody could hear what Tom was saying.
Tom said he'd visit Mary in Australia next summer.
They're welfare queens.
Not everyone's ready.
There's gonna be a storm.
Tom must have been skeptical.
Where's the meeting going to be?
I think Tom's wrong.
Tom said Mary thought John might not want to do that.
I thought it would be easy to do that.

Tom doesn't want to go to his company's Christmas do this year.
You're nothing but a student.
Tom said he would never allow Mary to do that.
Why do you think Tom likes baseball so much?
I'll call you later.
Many people think that's not going to happen.

Tom told me he was going to try it again.
I wish you had told me earlier.

I don't think Tom would allow Mary to do that on her own.
Don't study.
I thought you were still in Australia.
Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable.
I'm not sure both Tom and Mary want to go there.
I don't think it'll take very long to do that for you.
I think Tom wants me to go with Mary.
I know you want to help.
Tom and I both stood up at the same time.
They said they didn't have to hurry.
I know you have more important things to think about.
I'm not deaf.
I haven't read all the books.
Tom should never have been cut off.
Did you know Tom's not planning to attend today's meeting?
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she got fired.
Tom said Mary would probably have to do that.
This is the kind of music I like to listen to.
She hooked herself a jumper.
I know Tom used to be good at doing that.
Tom wasn't the one who told Mary that she didn't have to do that.
I knew Tom was afraid the police might arrest him.
I suspect Tom didn't visit Australia.
I thought it would take months.
They thought they could do that for me.
It's been years since we last met.
I realize Tom could be finished doing that by 2:30.
I didn't have enough money to buy Tom a present.
Tom must have seen something.
I thought you said we weren't going to be here.
They say they're not afraid to do that.

I wonder if Tom knew Mary couldn't do that.
I'll check on Tom.
I hope you're good.
You don't think Tom suspects anything, do you?
They told me they'd help.
He's hard to please.
Tom and Mary said they were embarrassed.
I didn't know Tom should do that myself.
Tom said he suspected that Mary would do that.
Tom will be very suspicious if you do that.

I doubt Tom will stay around.
They say they're too old to start over.
The store is closed Mondays.
I know Tom's in the garage working on his motorcycle.
I don't want to make a mistake.
Tom and Mary said they heard the gunshots.
Let's make it believe we're cowboys.
I don't think I want to go there anymore.
Tom said he hopes you won't eat the last piece of cake.
I think Tom's the one who's supposed to do that.
I should have paid in advance.
We're going to the airport.
I doubted that Tom would be able to talk Mary into doing that.
It's not Tom's idea, it's mine.
I didn't think anyone else had noticed.
That cat is so cute!
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't know I wasn't going to do that.
I know Tom's a mechanic.
A jack of all trades is a master of none.
I wonder if Tom is satisfied.
I know you still want to be with me.
Tom told me he was unemployed.
I didn't know you could understand French.
I doubt you will be happy with my report.
I should have known Tom would do that.
Tom told me he used to live in Australia.
I'm glad you succeeded.
It won't take less than one hour to go there.
I knew Tom wouldn't pass the exam.
You can use my desk if you want.
I think Tom would agree with me.
Don't stay too long!
I know Tom's popular.
It makes sense.
Tom said he really did that without anyone's help.
I wonder if Tom is prepared to do that.
I don't think Tom would care if you did that today.
I know Tom used to be a speech coach.
He can't swim a mile.
Tom said he's probably not going to do that.
Tom said Mary was upset.
I don't think Tom's a good lawyer.
Tom's gonna have to figure it out.
Are you absolutely sure Tom has to do that?
They said they hope it will happen soon.
Tom said he's not being used.
I thought I had nothing to lose.
By dawn the storm was over.
No one I know really wants to do that.
I think Tom is expecting someone to make dinner for him.
They said they don't want to do that.
The price of gasoline is so high that we can't buy a big car.
Why didn't you tell me you knew how to do that already?
Tom told me he was hoping Mary would be discreet.
"Thanks." "What for?" "For everything."
You're a teacher.
Many men, many minds.
Anything is possible.
Tom and Mary told me they were displeased.
Tom and Mary say they need to do that.
Let's hope that never happens again.
I don't think that actually happened.
Tom said Mary has been arrested before.
Tom said Mary's not ready.
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name.
Tom had trouble admitting he was wrong.
I thought you might want to play a game of chess.
Tom said he thought Mary would be impressed.
I know it's highly unlikely anyone knows me.
Tom said he wasn't sure he could do it.
Are you gonna be okay?
They told me they were faint.
I thought something was really wrong with Tom.
Tom said he's not sleepy yet.
Tom assumed that everyone knew Mary was going to do that.
I know Tom probably shouldn't do that anymore.
I had no idea Tom could do that.
It looks like Tom's waiting for someone.
Tom said he thought Mary was probably having a good time in Boston.
You broke the computer.
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
They say they like to study French.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's favorite flower is.
I knew Tom was ready to do that.
I suspect Tom will probably do that.
Tom said he was gonna stay up all night long.
I didn't know Tom was a veteran.
I thought this was what you wanted me to buy.
My daughter often experienced asthma attacks as a child.
I knew Tom didn't know that you were the one who had done that.
We've already met everyone.
Tom said there was still a lot of things left to do.
You don't have a chance.
If Tom had enough money, he would have gone to Boston with Mary.
Tom told everyone that he was glad that that was going to happen.
You're always doubting my word.
I didn't know I couldn't do what Tom asked me to do.
There's a good chance we'll win.
Tom says he knows Mary can win.
I know Tom's not a baseball fan.
I knew Tom would ask Mary to do that.
I don't think Tom should agree to do that.
I don't think Tom's sold anything all day.
I think I'm too old for her.
I don't think I should have left early.
I didn't say I was going to Australia.
Tom should have stayed in Boston for a few more days.
I should've told Tom sooner.
Tom and Mary said they didn't like to do that.
Tom will remember.
It's not something I think I can do.
Tom told me where he was planning to stay.
I know you're not planning to stay in Australia.
I know Tom was impolite.
Do you have a pen I can borrow?
Tom also wanted to do that.
I could have done that for you.
I think Tom's home.
It's annoying for America to lose our young men and women.
Tom should do everything they tell him.
Everyone but Tom knew he didn't have to go to Australia.
What is the most beautiful place in the world?
The storm caused much damage to the crop.
I don't think everyone's given up.
Let's get our photograph taken.
I knew it wouldn't be easy.
Suddenly all the lights went out.
Tom and Mary said they'll probably win.
I think Tom would be annoyed if you did that.
Tom and Mary thought they'd find other jobs.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
I know I should stay and help.
Don't look at me.
I suspect Tom and Mary were planning to do that tomorrow.
I didn't know you knew how to drive a bus.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
I know Tom's doing that well.
Tom said nothing had changed.
That's not one of my priorities.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your party last night.
I know Tom knows that I had to do that.
Stay out of this.
I know Tom's afraid he'll be fired.
If I were you, I'd call the doctor.
I wasn't feeling very hungry.
I've done everything you've asked me to do.
Do you have a tie I could borrow?
I didn't think we'd find anyone who could do that for us.
Tom's not an angel.
I think Tom's mad.
That sounds awesome.
Tom's driving over to Mary's apartment to give something to her.
Tom said he thought Mary would wait.
Tom said he didn't think that the smell bothered Mary.
Tom said he's willing to do that for us.
Can you believe Tom's still only thirteen?
Tom sent Mary his picture.
Tom already knows that Mary's not planning to be here today.
They say they've never eaten Thai food.
I think Tom and Mary have never both been to Boston.
They're playing chess.
I thought I heard someone singing.
I heard Tom planning to move to Australia.
It's not as hot as I expected.
They don't think they'll do that.
I don't think I belong here.
Nobody saw Tom leave.
I knew Tom used to live in Boston.
Tom ran back home to get something he forgot.
Tom told me he might win.
Tom had no problems with Mary.
I thought Tom refused to do that.
How do you know you're not misinterpreting me for someone else?
You should have refused to stay in Boston.
No one can save you.
I'm glad I didn't do that.
I'm starting to believe we'll never convince Tom that he's wrong.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Tom should never have been let out of jail.
His train arrives at the main station at 5.50 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.
Tom said that Mary thought that John might be required to do that by himself.
I know what I would do.
He doesn't have to bring the paraply.
Both Tom and Mary were not at home when we went to visit them.
Tom thinks I need to do that today.
Tom admitted he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a pity we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity.
Tom told me you were with him yesterday afternoon.
Tom and I didn't know that we were the ones that were supposed to do that.
I'm so tired that I can hardly walk.
They felt that they needed to do something.
I read many foreign languages, but I speak none.
You set up a trap.
I should have added more salt.
I know that's not what you want.
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to be married.
I think Tom's smashed.
Tom and Mary say they'll never do that.
I think Tom's sorry.
You were skinny the first time I met you.
I think Tom could have come home by himself.
Tom and Mary both know who you are.
Mary said she's not planning to do that by herself.
It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were unimpressed.
Tom hasn't told us what he needs to do yet.
I know you probably didn't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom still remembers where we first met.
If only you had helped me yesterday, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said he expected Mary to get back to Boston on October 20.
Tom said he thought he might be required to do that again.
Tom thinks you want me to pay the bill.
Tom and Mary said they didn't swim.
I knew Tom told Mary he couldn't do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize they're being ignored.
If Tom had left at 2:30, he would have come here right now.
Tom and Mary said they'd do it.
There's no doubt Tom used to live in Australia.
Tom has decided to stay in Australia for another three days.
Tom said he thought I seemed unconcerned.
I should have stayed and helped Tom.
Tom said he thought I could do that.
I figured Tom would panic.
Tom thinks he's the best swimmer here.
I wonder if it will snow tomorrow.
I wonder if Tom is pleased.
I'm frying fish.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Slow down.
Tom would have done that right now if he was really planning to do it.
I know Tom could do that if he really needed to.
We'll never know.
Tom admitted that he had killed Mary.
Didn't you know your taillights weren't working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom will never hurt anyone again.
I am learning Esperanto very quickly.
You're not going to get in trouble for helping me, are you?
I've heard that women spend more on shoes than men.
I think Tom's gonna be excited.
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
Tom said he'd take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do anything he wants to do.
I thought you were going to fix that.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told he will not be allowed to do that.
They say they're unsure.
I know Tom didn't know he wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom should have told me earlier.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Both men apologized to each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn't think John will actually do that.
They say that they also need to do that.
I know Tom knows why Mary had to do that.
They told me they'd help me.
I don't think I'll ever afford to buy a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn't speak French.
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary say they don't think they snore.
I knew Tom was active in his church.
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tom said he found something.
A business is not a charity.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had ever been to Australia.
I don't think Tom's as good-looking as John is.
Tom said he thought that prices at that store were too high.
I don't think anyone disputes that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't remember.
Tom said he hoped he could do that today.
You knew everyone at the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was unfrauded.
I'm sorry it happened like this.
I know Tom's not afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Tom and I are both angry.
I don't think Tom will be able to do that without any help.
It's hot.
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston.
No one asked me whether I liked it or not.
Many old people these days can't keep up with the times.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know Tom appreciated that.
Tom told me he'd decided to do that.
It's a kind of cat.
Tom thought Mary would probably refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
Tom denied that he had accepted the bribe.
Tom said he thought it wouldn't be a good idea.
I admit I didn't do what Tom said I had to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was broke.
Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable.
Can't this wait till morning?
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
We know that won't happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his throat loudly.
I think Tom's unprejudiced.
I'm afraid I've lost it.
Tom said Mary was likely to be grumpy.
We're both adults.
They're not as weak as they used to be.
I know Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do that today.
Don't talk about business while we're eating.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was tough.
I hope Tom gets adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She has to be taken to the hospital.
I would have helped you if you had asked.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wig.
This is not a drill.
Tom should've done that a long time ago.
I think Tom slept all afternoon.
I wonder if Tom is upset.
Tom said he knew they might not let him do that at school.
Tom said he hopes Mary likes to do that.
Tom would have done that for Mary if he had had more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something's still not right.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom liked riddles.
I know Tom's not planning on going to Boston with you.
Tom said he's not sure Mary has to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be able to talk Mary into doing that.
Is it true that Tom and Mary are planning to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know you didn't want to do that on your own.
Tom said he thought it would be fun.
I think you'll find out it was Tom's fault.
I thought it was pretty brilliant.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are going to do that?
What makes you think Tom and Mary were the ones who did that?
Are you still planning to do that with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
His younger sister is a famous TV star.
I know when you said you'd be there, but I couldn't be there at that time.
I don't think they're complaining.
You and I both know that's not true.
Let's assume that'll happen.
Tom told everyone he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone he could trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was being truthful.
It's quite likely Tom will come.
I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year.
I didn't think anyone had tried that before.
You should've made better use of your time.
They say they're not planning to go.
Tom said it looked like Mary was having a really hard time doing that.
I'm learning Old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could have done that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard to get along with.
They said they were very drunk.
You could have told me earlier.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conceited.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptical.
I know Tom never does that anymore.
Tom says he only swears when it's absolutely necessary.
I don't think Tom's high.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
Tom said he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
Tom told me that he thought this book was interesting.
Tom assumed everyone knew he couldn't do that.
Tom said he was planning on going on October 20th.
They said they're doing fine.
Hostilities resumed between the two powers.
The only reason Tom came to Australia was because everyone else in his family did.
I would have done that if I could.
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning to do that.
Tom assumed that everyone at school knew he had been arrested.
Tom wished he knew how to make Mary happy.
Tom said he's seen Mary do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.
Tom said he thought Mary would be able to do that.
I think Tom's the one who's supposed to tell Mary to do that.
Everyone knows Tom can't speak French very well.
My findings suggest that is not the case.
Tom found the watch he had lost.
I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Someone must have left the window open.
I know Tom's a messy person.
I'm sorry, sir, there must have been some mistake.
I know Tom knew Mary was planning to do that.
Tom was just saying the obvious.
Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
Tom didn't know Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said he'd be able to do that in a few hours.
No one doubts that you will be able to pass the examination.
Where's everybody?
How have you felt?
Fortune favors the brave.
They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still staring at me.
I thought Tom had heard us.
It's not obligatory.
I hope no one comes.
What color was Tom wearing?
Tom and Mary wouldn't ask you to do that for them if they could find anyone else to do it for them.
Tom said he'd walk Mary home.
It'll be hard for Tom to win.
We should have hired someone more qualified.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unimpressed.
I wonder if Tom knows he's overweight.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me that he was too tired to study.
Where's your baggage?
Both my parents are musicians.
I live in Groningen.
How do we know that's not true?
Tom said he didn't want to die.
That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said he thought Mary would be able to help him do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's chubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom will be willing to talk to me.
Tom said he's glad Mary was able to win.
I didn't think you'd be able to get Tom to do that.
It's not raining.
I can't speak English, much less German.
Tom thought something bad would happen.
I thought that's what you would have wanted.
I know it's highly unlikely anyone knows me.
Where's Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I doubt Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I both enjoy playing volleyball.
It's not likely Tom will ever admit he's wrong.
Tom said he was unable to win.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that soon.
There's a possibility Tom won't want to go to Boston with us.
It's not enough to know just one language.
She's a blonde girl.
Tom thinks we can't do that.
I know Tom's a better tennis player than I am.
Tom said he's not mad.
Tom may have done the same thing Mary did.
I know Tom's a sophomore.
Tom definitely knew he shouldn't have eaten that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interested.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do that until Monday.
Tom should never have tried to do that by himself.
How's your father?
My son's not a snob.
I would have let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was more difficult than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
No one suspected it.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that alone.
I wonder if it's gonna be really hot tomorrow.
Is this the first time you've experienced this kind of pain?
Tom said that Mary knew she might not have to do that again.
They swore they wouldn't do that again.
I'm not really planning to do that.
I know Tom will allow you to do that.
Tom said Mary would do that.
They've said they won't do that.
Tom thinks Mary won't do that for John.
Tom said he thought there was a good chance that Mary would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would like it.
You're not the only one Tom asked.
Tom thought Mary wasn't done that yet.
They put their notebooks away.
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable.
I didn't know Tom could do that.
I didn't say I used to live in Australia.
Tom said he knew why Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said he wanted to buy something for Mary.
I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he would.
Tom said he thought Mary was over thirty.
We went up by two floors to reach the apparel stalls.
I don't think Tom's funny.
Tom thinks he's gonna die soon.
I thought Tom was sick.
I know Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that.
They said they'd be happy to help.
Tom and I both want to go.
I didn't know you'd tell me.
Tom and Mary said they were jealous.
I thought I could do that for Tom.
Tom promised that he would never make such a mistake again.
Don't you think we should have talked to Tom about this?
Tom told me he thought Mary was fat.
Tom told me that he thought Mary still wanted to go to Australia.
Don't sweat the little stuff.
I don't think anyone can help me now.
Tom said it's a very common problem.
Are you sure this will work?
I'm afraid I'll be tied up all afternoon.
I know you can hear me.
You seemed unwilling to do that.
Tom told Mary that he thought she was doing it wrong, but she didn't care what he thought.
The doctor is not available now.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's a first-time offender.
I promise you that won't happen.
Tom said that Mary thought he might need to do that.
Tom said he wouldn't ever try to do that again.
I don't think it ever worked.
Do not forget to take your medicine.
You don't know how hard it was for Tom.
Tom has given me a lot of things.
I know Tom's a few years older than Mary.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
I know Tom can't do that without any help.
Tom admitted he lied to me.
Tom and Mary have told John they're not planning on staying home all day.
Tom doesn't know I still have this.
We're not exactly sure what we're supposed to be doing.
We both love Tom.
Tom said he hopes you try your best to do that.
I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what everyone else wanted to do.
Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that this evening.
I don't think I know the man who's playing the drums.
This old man has liver spots on his skin.
Tom and Mary vowed they would never do that.
Give me that candle.
Tom didn't seem to be aware of what he needed to do.
There's no time to explain.
Tom didn't realize he had to leave.
They said they were afraid.
Tom and Mary say they can't find their hats.
I graduated from Kyoto University.
You're comparing apples and oranges!
Tom said there was still a lot of work to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was embarrassed.
Tom said he thought he'd be arrested.
Tom and Mary told me they were worn out.
I've heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to see Mary anymore.
They're living in a fantasy world.
They said they thought I was charming.
I didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
I don't think you'll have much fun doing that.
I suspect Tom doesn't do that as often as he used to.
I was surprised Tom didn't know how to do that.
I plan to skip lunch.
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him to.
Tom told me he thought Mary was scared.
Tom's already told me he's decided to go to Boston next summer.
That doesn't make any sense.
They say they're dying.
Tom offered to lend me some money.
Do you think Tom would let me do that?
Tom had no idea that Mary didn't know what she was doing.
Tom told everyone he needed to do that.
I don't think Tom is a native French speaker.
They said they weren't planning to go.
They say they taught French.
I suspect Tom and Mary are curious.
I know Tom knows I don't have to do that.
You have to help Tom.
Tom told us he had a headache.
The bomb was defused just minutes before it would have exploded.
Tom and Mary told me they'd win, but they didn't.
I'm glad to hear it!
Tom and Mary say they don't know any French.
I don't think we'll find anyone who can help us do that.
You should have refused to go to Boston.
I thought you didn't approve of Tom dating Mary.
Tom said that's not the main reason Mary should do that.
Tom doesn't have a car and neither does Mary.
I'm a cat.
I know you don't do that anymore.
Tom said he was no different.
Tom admitted what he said was wrong.
Tom could have been scared.
Who do you think asked me to give this to you?
I've just been sick.
I hope I get an raise.
Tom said he didn't think we should even consider doing that.
Tom said he would have come if we had invited him.
I don't think I'll probably do that.
Tom said he might cry.
It's Sunday.
Tom told me he wasn't tired.
I didn't think anyone really thought Tom was busy.
I think you know we have to do that today.
I didn't think Tom would actually do that.
I knew Tom would leave early.
Tom said he thought Mary understood French.
Tom said he needed my help, so I helped him.
I don't think anyone has lived in this house in a long time.
Tom denied he stole the money.
Tom said he hasn't decided what he'll do yet.
Everyone knew Tom didn't like to go to Boston.
Tom said he thought tomorrow would be a sunny day.
Tom's obviously drunk.
I'm absolutely sure that's not going to happen.
Everyone was there except Tom.
I thought you promised to give that to Tom.
I thought you said you saw Tom this morning.
I think Tom was supposed to be here.
Tom and Mary said they had fully recovered.
I didn't know you weren't planning to do that on your own.
I don't think there's a way out of here.
There is no rose without a thorn.
Tom thought Mary probably didn't know John spoke French.
You know I wouldn't do that.
I think we all know that's a bad idea.
I thought Tom knew what Mary had to do.
Tom was probably about thirteen years old at the time.
Tom and Mary said they were ticklish.
Tom said he wouldn't be able to help weed the garden today.
I wonder how Tom knew I would be here.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
I'm not sure Tom would let me do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was mean.
So, where's the problem?
Tom didn't think Mary was beautiful.
He will have to do that task again.
I know Tom didn't know anyone who could do that.
Only fresh road is sold here.
I think this is not a good idea.
Tom has already been asked not to do that.
Here's your change.
That portrait reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago.
When was the last time you asked someone for help?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Tom told me he thought Mary was skinny.
I know Tom's upset.
I didn't meet anyone new today.
This lake is the deepest in Japan.
I knew Tom was planning to do that.
Tom and I both don't speak French.
I thought you'd be ready.
I know Tom knew why Mary didn't like that.
I didn't think Tom was happy that had happened.
They said they were very tired.
You're not old enough to get a driver's license, are you?
I don't think there's any harm in telling you now.
I thought you said you did that on Monday.
Everyone here knows Tom's in Boston.
Tom denied he met Mary last week.
That's not why I'm here.
Austria is a parliamentary republic in mid-Europe and consists of nine Bundess countries.
Tom and Mary are looking for someone to help them build a wall.
They said they're not thirty yet.
I didn't think Tom really needed to do that yesterday.
I thought Tom was already back.
Tom said Mary knew she might not be allowed to do that unless John does it with her.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were happy.
Tom said that Mary thought John might be required to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I thought Mary was cute.
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to do that by herself.
Tom said he thought Mary was happy.
Tom said he stayed in Australia?
Tom said he'd pay for everything.
They told me they weren't alone.
I don't think I can finish the job alone.
Tom said Mary's not safe.
Tom said I looked thiner than the last time he saw me.
They said they'd see me tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was concerned.
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's gonna do this afternoon.
Tom paid someone to do that.
I thought Tom would be cooperative.
Tom told me he was safe.
Tom said I should go to Boston with you.
They think they know what to do.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna be scared.
Tom and I are both very proud of you.
I knew Tom would show Mary how to do that if she asked him to.
We can't pretend Tom's normal.
Tom's having fun.
Tom should never have tried to do that alone.
Tom and Mary said they'd never do that.
I'm taller than him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conservative.
Tom said he thought Mary probably wouldn't want to do that on a cold day like today.
The teachers' room and gym are under renovation.
Do you think there's any chance you'll be able to do that?
Tom put his glass down.
You would think that would have impressed Tom.
This is the first time I've bought a newspaper in this city.
That's a good question.
Without water, we cannot exist.
Tom certainly understands that we all need to attend today's meeting.
Tom and Mary said they didn't agree to do that.
I know Tom will be able to help us do that.
I had lunch three hours ago.
Tom said he appreciated Mary's help.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
You're the only one who can protect them.
Can someone explain this to me?
Did you know Tom was going to be in Boston all week?
Tom and Mary told me they wanted a dog.
Everyone knows that Tom and Mary like each other.
I know Tom didn't know I wasn't going to do that.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom has a lot of things to do.
Tom and Mary say they're not sure they're ready.
There is no logical reason for this.
I suspected Tom was intoxicated.
I hope I gave you enough money to buy everything you needed.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary enjoyed doing that.
They said they were fine.
I wish you hadn't seen me do that.
Tom and Mary said they had no money.
I don't think I need to tell Tom to do that.
Tom should never have got that job.
Tom told Mary that she was his only one.
Tom knew he wouldn't be expelled.
Tom was convinced that Mary didn't want to do that.
Tom said he knew that was what Mary had to do.
I think you're great.
I wonder if Tom's going to Boston next week.
Tom says he didn't know Mary wouldn't go to Australia unless he went with her.
I know Tom doesn't want to do that.
You're not an idiot.
I don't think Tom wins very often when he plays chess.
Tom said he didn't know Mary wasn't able to speak French very well.
Tom said he knew Mary would win the race.
I know Tom came to Australia last week.
Tom said Mary wasn't mad.
I think we've bought everything we need.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom's hiding something, and Mary knows it.
I think Tom's average.
You're not just working for Tom.
Tom said he knew that Mary might be required to do that by himself.
I don't think Tom knows how it happened.
It's not a watch.
Tom and Mary said they're unfrauded.
I'm from the United States.
I don't think Tom knows how to have a good time.
I know you don't want to hurt me.
Tom seems unwilling to correct his mistakes.
I loved that book!
Tom said Mary wouldn't like that.
Tom said he felt safe.
Tom's home sick.
Did you know that would happen?
I think Tom believed me.
I don't think we can do that by 2:30.
Tom thinks Mary probably wouldn't do that.
I thought you said we were not going to do that anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who can do that.
I'm pretty sure Tom has a girlfriend.
I thought you might be the only person who would listen to me.
I know Tom didn't know Mary didn't do that.
Tom said he thought Mary would be nervous to do that.
That's the guitar I want to buy.
I think Tom did it.
See you tomorrow morning!
They told me they were ambidextrous.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't have to do that.
I really thought Tom would change his mind.
Tom would have missed the train if he had stopped buying a chocolate bar.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be excited about that.
I didn't know I was supposed to help Tom do that.
No matter what you say, I'm convinced I'm right.
Tom said he didn't need any more help.
We can't make a change in our schedule.
I was shocked when I heard Tom had been arrested.
Tom and Mary probably don't know they're not supposed to park there.
I thought you could use a friend.
You're not really going to kill Tom, are you?
They said they'd be willing to help us.
Tom told me he'd done that.
Tom's not the same as he was thirty years ago.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this today.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary she needs to do that today.
America's Civil War lasted four years.
They say they're disappointed.
It is not always easy to distinguish good from evil.
Tom said he's gonna try something he's never done before.
I don't think Tom's strong.
It's not too hard.
Tom said you didn't want to go to Boston with us.
I suspect Tom and Mary are suspicious.
You're a prude.
Tom said he would have done that if he could.
I don't think anyone really wants to do that.
Tom said he wished he had kissed Mary good night.
If you do that, I will, too.
I think Tom is irreplaceable.
They told me they were tempted to do that.
I don't think I have everything I need.
That's not what Tom wanted you to do.
What book did you give to Tom?
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last year.
Tom and Mary say they're hoping they can do that.
I know Tom expected me to do that.
I wonder if Tom's ever been to Boston.
It's not quite finished.
Tom said he was frustrated.
I know Tom will be doing that with Mary.
I sent Mary some roses.
Tom said Mary was taller than her sister.
I wasn't as hungry as Tom.
Will you lend me your dictionary?
I buy things that I know I'm not going to use.
Tom claims he didn't kill anyone.
Tom and Mary said they were very grateful.
How are you doing today?
Tom said Mary wanted to do that yesterday.
Tom told me he's not gonna do that.
I know Tom's much stronger than I am.
It was not an easy decision.
I wonder if I can still do that.
I knew Tom didn't want me to do that.
Tom didn't tell anyone anything.
Tom's thirtyth birthday tomorrow.
Tom said he didn't think Mary really did what John said she did.
Tom and Mary said they were Canadian.
They were hoping they'd be able to win.
Tom said he was glad that Mary could do that.
I should have told you everything earlier.
I thought you had another reason.
I think you shouldn't have bought that car.
Tom told Mary that he was unwilling to do that.
I should have known Tom would be busy.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
Tom said he heard someone yelling.
Tom told me he thought Mary had to do that.
Tom thought I didn't have to do that.
Nobody asked for your help.
I thought Tom did that yesterday.
Tom was not allowed to board the plane because he did not hold a valid travel document.
Something's not right.
Tom thinks Mary is trying to discredit him.
Tom didn't seem too angry.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't done that yet.
I don't think Tom's gonna be early.
Tom told me Mary was nervous.
Samurai lived by a code of honor.
I know Tom doesn't know when I did that.
Tom said Mary's been here before.
I can't believe Tom actually did that.
I don't think I've bought everything I need.
Tom said he had nothing to do.
I should've noticed it before.
I thought Tom was going to ask Mary not to do that.
I wonder if Tom wanted to do that.
Tom said he thought we might have a problem.
It rained for three days straight.
Tom thought Mary was pregnant.
When was the first time Tom did that?
Do you know if Tom and Mary are allowed to do that?
We told everyone we were moving to Australia.
Please do that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
I don't think Tom's married anymore.
Tom said he thought Mary would be alone.
Everyone knows Tom and I don't like each other.
I'll see you tomorrow.
They say they were hungry.
Tom said he should have done that.
Tom was cremated.
Tom said he thought Mary had already done that.
Tom told me he thought he might be able to do that.
I suspect Tom is still in love with his ex-wife.
I know Tom knew Mary had to do that.
Tom is very rarely waiting for anyone.
I just assumed that everyone was going to do that.
I don't think you understand what this means.
It's not possible.
I don't think you have the guts.
I've been busy since yesterday.
Tom said I shouldn't have tried that by myself.
Tom said he wished he hadn't tried to do that.
Tom was the one who told me I had to do that.
I didn't think we could get home by 2:30.
Tom said he couldn't sleep last night.
Tom told me he thought Mary was creative.
Tom could have come yesterday, but he didn't.
I didn't know Tom didn't want to do that alone.
Tom thinks he's better than anyone else.
I wonder if Tom was able to do that by himself.
Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't done it.
I suspect Tom will probably have to do that.
You know I'm not good with secrets.
I'm not as busy now as I was this time last year.
I would've talked to Tom instead of just ignored him.
I thought you'd like to meet my family.
I don't think Tom will be disobedient.
Tom said he was going to do that every day after he retired.
There's not much I can do to help, I'm afraid.
Both Tom and Mary are still not married.
I know Tom knew Mary couldn't do that.
We're at school together.
I want you to look at these documents.
Tom's tired.
Tom said he didn't need a lawyer.
Tom and Mary said they'd be on train.
I didn't know Tom didn't really want to do that alone.
Tom said he was going to ask Mary to leave.
Tom and Mary are going out for a walk after lunch.
I know Tom's grouchy.
Tom's passed out.
Doing that would be hard.
Tom said he didn't know anything about Mary.
I thought Tom lived in Australia.
I'm very surprised Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom doesn't think you're gonna be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he'd be arrested.
I don't think Tom's available.
I don't think Tom is doing that.
I wonder if Tom is interested.
I don't think Tom liked the song you wrote about him.
I think I'll take this tie.
Tom thought he might not be required to do that by himself.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary's never done that before.
Tom gave me all the money I asked for.
Tom said Mary knew John might want to do that by himself.
The wood has become saturated with water.
I don't think Tom understood.
They said they had been handcuffed.
Tom can do that, but Mary can't.
I don't think it's a problem anymore.
Tom told me he thinks he's gonna do that tomorrow.
I thought it would be clear in the afternoon.
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be finished doing that by 2:30.
I'm an insomnia.
Tom said he'll ask Mary if she wants to do that.
I know that doesn't matter.
Tom says Mary is trustworthy.
Tom and Mary told me they enjoyed the picnic.
I know I shouldn't have done that, but I did it anyway.
I think Tom was the one who painted this fence.
Tom must have thought Mary could speak French.
He's a very affectionate father.
How did Tom know Mary would do that?
Tom told me he was in a lot of trouble.
Tom thinks it's gonna rain tomorrow.
I didn't know Tom owned a gun.
I thought there was a good chance Tom would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would want your old bike.
I wonder if Tom knows who left this package on my desk.
Tom should have been found guilty.
It's not working yet.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be angry.
You're not really planning to help Tom, are you?
Tom, it's not necessary to apologize.
I'm already late.
Tom knows he's got a problem.
I became a doctor so that I could help people.
You can't buy happiness.
You promised you'd do that.
Tom said he thought Mary would be absent.
It won't be as hard to do as you think it will be.
Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't like him.
Are you over 18?
Tom won't leave his children here with us.
Tom didn't realize that we wanted to do that.
Tom said he thought you were likely to do that.
Tom said that Mary thought that he might be required to do that the next time he travels.
Tom said he did that for Mary.
Tom said he doesn't think it's necessary to do that.
Tom said Mary is not sure whether John wants to do that or not.
I thought things would get better.
I hope Tom and Mary aren't quicker to do that than I am.
Tom said he's glad you're back.
Tom said he thought Mary was unlikely to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conceited.
The way you plan to do that is dangerous.
You should have come sooner.
I think Tom's strong.
Tom and Mary didn't know they were supposed to be here yesterday.
I seriously doubt Tom will be there.
Tom said he's really glad he moved to Australia.
I know Tom's a forest Ranger.
It'll be hard for Tom to do that.
They said they'd only talk to you.
French is her mother tongue.
I don't think Tom should do that alone.
Tom picked up his bag and left.
I'm not the only one here who's not married.
Tom said he knew he might not have to do that again.
They know that they should do that today.
You should have been a lawyer.
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't know I'm here.
I don't think I need to wear a tie to the party.
I don't think there's any reason Tom has to do that.
Tom said Mary was likely to still be pessimistic.
I don't think I could do that even if I tried.
I know Tom hasn't asked Mary to do that yet.
Tom told me he thought Mary was talented.
I don't think that doing that is a very good idea.
I'm afraid Tom might not do what he's supposed to do.
Tom said Mary didn't want to go to the concert.
Tom told me he'd drive Mary to the airport.
Tom said he's driving to Boston on Monday.
They told me they're sleepy.
I know you and Tom will do that together.
I think this is the first time Tom has done that.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be punished.
I know Tom's a very rich man.
Tom must have been home at that time.
I don't think I'm going to like being here.
There's no hope.
Tom could have camped with you if you'd let him know you were going.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary kept doing that even though he asked her not to.
Tom told me he thought Mary was still interested in doing that.
Are you good at reading maps?
Tom says Mary lies a lot.
I doubt Tom will ever do that.
I think Tom is probably a pretty good lawyer.
I thought I could do that without any help.
You're pulling my leg.
I thought you said you'd never try to do that on your own.
I don't think we'll do that on our own.
I know Tom will be the last one to do that.
Tom said he'd give a book to Mary.
I know Tom didn't know why I was planning to do that.
Tom didn't know I was Mary's cousin.
They said they didn't know any French.
I thought you might quit.
I had no idea Tom was planning to tell Mary not to do that.
I thought you wanted to be a dancer.
I don't think I'd be very good company.
Tom says the party's over.
It looks like it's going to rain.
Tom said I might not want to do that by myself.
Security is not guaranteed.
Tom didn't offer to help.
I think Tom will be truthful.
I assumed Tom had told you that I would be here.
Did you know I was going to be arrested?
She's a despisable human being.
Tom already intends to do that.
Take off your school uniform.
I suspect Tom will have to help Mary do that.
I'm afraid I can't.
I know Tom's almost as tall as you.
The first time I met Tom, he was only thirteen years old.
Tom says Australia is his favorite country.
I suspect Tom has never done that.
I thought we could help.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a kid?
I'd like to stay longer.
Tom's planning to do that today.
You're the same age as I am.
Tom and Mary say this will be the last time they try to do that.
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Tom said he wished he had given Mary flowers.
They said they had an alibi.
Tom was able to do what he needed to do.
I knew you wouldn't like Australia.
I couldn't think of anything.
I wish you'd never told me.
Tom won't know I'm here.
I don't think you're as good a driver as you say you are.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary had to do that.
They told me they were lonely.
What's the time now?
Tom said things went well.
Tom told everyone he didn't know how to speak French.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
Tom said he didn't know where Mary learned how to do that.
I doubt we'll be able to prove that.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom couldn't speak French.
Tom was surprised that no one else was there.
I'm not surprised Tom doesn't have to do that.
He's not very good at the game of politics.
Tom thought it would be funny to put an egg on Mary's chair.
They said they didn't feel hot.
This is the first time I've ever eaten in an Italian pizzeria.
Tom said he couldn't clean the pool tomorrow afternoon.
Tom says he's not planning to do that.
I thought you said nobody was going to be here.
Tom thinks Mary's pushy.
I'm skinny.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Tom drank less than Mary did.
Tom said he assumed that Mary would want to do that.
You can't do a lot of things at the same time.
I don't remember her name.
The father works.
Tom and Mary say they're not afraid.
I'll save you a piece of pie.
I thought I was going to be asked to give a speech.
It's a privilege to meet you.
Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him she had to do that.
Tom said he thought you could help us today.
I'm used to staying up late.
I thought Tom looked happy.
Tom said Mary should do that somewhere else.
Nobody seemed to want to do that.
Tom said that he knew that he might not be required to do that by himself.
Nobody told you about the meeting, did they?
I know this is Monday.
Tom says he needs to find someone to do that for him.
I think Tom was supposed to be here right now.
I know Tom and Mary are divorced.
Tom must have seen us.
I know Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to be doing that here.
I know Tom was going to do that in Australia last month.
Tom has no reason not to do that.
Mary told me she thought Tom was handsome.
I didn't know you'd be jealous.
I think both Tom and Mary want something to eat.
They said they didn't mind doing that.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
I think Tom wants you to do that.
Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary she shouldn't do that here.
Tom and Mary said they're not sick.
I knew Tom should do that outside.
I wonder if I should do that.
I suspect Tom and Mary know something's going on.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Tom told me he thought Mary was retired.
What's your last name?
Tom told me he thought Mary had left.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would have to do that.
I know Tom knows that Mary seldom does that anymore.
You're braver than me.
Tom said he was getting drowsy.
They said they tried to do that once.
Tom said he thought Mary would be in Australia for three weeks.
I should have told Tom not to believe what Mary says.
It would have been interesting to do that.
If you had told me earlier, I would have dressed up.
I think Tom's scared.
Tom said he's sure Mary can swim.
What's her problem?
I think Tom's focused.
I am not interested in this.
I thought the police were looking for Tom.
Why is everybody staring at me?
Tom has everything he needs.
They view foreigners with suspicion; I see everyone with suspicion.
I don't think I can do that better than you.
You could have let me know you were going to be late.
Tom's delirious.
Willing to correct is a sign of wisdom.
Tom would never do that.
I don't think anyone else wants to do that today.
It's not as humid today as it was yesterday.
If I had known how to do it, I would have done it myself.
Tom repaired his bike.
You're not really planning to take pictures, are you?
He's two years younger than I am.
Tom and Mary told me they were frustrated.
I didn't know Tom had to do that anymore.
I thought you said you've seen people do that.
It's obvious Tom's waiting for someone.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
Tom said he's reluctant to do that for us.
Give it back!
Tom said he thought Mary could help us today.
I thought the concert went pretty well.
I can't cook at all.
I thought Tom knew what we had to do.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
I don't think anyone saw us do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might be able to win.
I wonder if Tom has another one.
Everyone except Tom seemed to be having fun.
Tom said he needed money so he could buy something to eat.
Tom was not surprised that Mary did that.
I knew Tom was done with that.
I'm not sure that's possible.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Australia with me.
I thought Tom was still in school.
I knew Tom would be the next one to do that.
They'll be glad they didn't.
They say they'll buy it for you.
They say they don't need money.
Tom is unwilling to go alone.
I know Tom didn't have to do that with us.
Everyone agrees that it was the right decision.
Tom got out of the bath and put his clothes on.
I don't think Tom's planning to help us.
They say they feel better now.
I assume you're going to the dance with Tom.
Tom thought I might be required to do that by myself.
I don't think that's anyone I know.
I don't think Tom did what you said he did.
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name.
I don't think it's gonna be hard for Tom to do that.
Tom said he doesn't know where Mary wants to go.
Tom and Mary both lived in Australia when they were kids.
Tom really thought we didn't have to do that.
It's not good for anyone.
Tom said he often thinks about leaving.
Do Tom and Mary know you don't like them?
I know I've been very stupid.
Tom and Mary are both full-time students.
I know that Tom and only Tom need to do that.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary has to do that today.
I suspect Tom and Mary don't like me very much.
I wonder if I can do that.
Tom really thought we wanted to do that.
I wish I could visit Australia.
She's eating.
He's the love of my life.
I think Tom is a good painter.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's making for dinner.
It wasn't that hard to find a pair of shoes that fit.
I would never have let Tom do that.
I've promised Tom I'd go to Australia with him.
Tom sings better than me.
Tom said he had a hard day.
Do you feel like swimming?
Tom and Mary still hope that they can win.
Tom knows we can't win.
I don't think I could do that.
You're blamed.
I thought you said your car was stolen.
I didn't know Tom would be faster to do that than Mary.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Australia when they were children.
If Tom doesn't, I won't either.
Tom told me he thought Mary was funny.
I know Tom didn't know Mary should do that.
I wonder if Tom really stayed in Boston last summer.
In his heart, Tom knew that he would never return.
We're not ready to go home yet.
Tom should have eaten more.
I thought Tom was going to give Mary flowers.
Tom said that Mary thought John might be required to do that in the near future.
I didn't think we had enough food to feed everyone.
I should have listened to what my mother said.
Tom's wasting time.
I think Tom was exaggerating.
I was convinced that I shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary is probably still nervous.
If this is madness, there is a method in it.
Tom told me everything I needed to know.
They told everyone they were upset.
Tom said he won't do that unless I help him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sincere.
She knows about things like that.
I don't think I've ever heard Tom complain about Mary's cooking.
I suspect Tom and Mary are ready to do that.
What's your pharmacy's name?
I don't think anyone else wants to come.
I knew Tom was very busy.
Tom said that he thought I might not have to do that until October.
What's worrying you, Tom?
Tom's a traveling salesman.
I suspect Tom's not in Boston anymore.
Tom is convinced that he needs to do that.
This is the first time I've visited Australia.
I knew Tom didn't know he didn't really have to do that.
Everyone knows we killed Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't rather go to Australia with us.
Dinner's not ready yet.
I hope I can help you tomorrow.
Sure we could do that, but it would be really hard to do.
I could have saved Tom's life.
There's a good chance Tom will ask Mary to dance.
Tom told me he found an interesting book about Australia at the local library.
I don't think we can take care of ourselves.
Do you need a lift?
I thought I made my reasons clear.
Tom's someone I look up to.
Tom says he's sorry he broke his promise.
I think I have just enough money to buy the computer I want.
I realize Tom will try to do that.
I'm very glad to see you.
They said they're cold.
I know Tom knows I don't have to do that.
Tom's just done what he should have done last week.
Tom says he doesn't usually wear underwear.
I know Tom's a better musician than Mary.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary was planning to do.
Tom and Mary said they'd win and they did.
Nobody knew that but Tom.
Tom thought Mary wasn't cold.
Tom told me he thought Mary was still living in Australia.
I thought Tom would be happy about that.
I know Tom would allow you to do that.
Tom told Mary he thought John wasn't asleep.
Tom goes to Boston every chance he gets.
I know Tom never considered doing that.
Didn't you know I was hoping Tom would do that?
They said they'll call you later.
I promise we'll listen to everything you say.
I think you'll enjoy it there.
It's not all that ridiculous.
I wonder if we have to do that.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to do that today.
The fuse's blown.
Tom and Mary weren't able to help me do that.
Tom should have been interested.
I wonder if Tom really wants me to do that today.
It's not good to ridicule people in public.
We should have planned for this.
I don't think you need to tell Tom why you didn't do that.
They say they never did that.
Tom and Mary said they're not going to do that.
I know Tom's connected.
Tom said he had to spend a few weeks in Australia.
Let's get married.
Get the fuck out!
I think Tom's been to Boston at least once.
He's leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
I wasn't as helpful as I should have been.
Tom said Mary was living in Australia.
They told me they don't like to study in the morning.
You tricked me!
We're too busy for that, Tom.
Is this seat empty?
Tom said he wish he hadn't told Mary that he forgot to do that.
You're free to go.
I know Tom is confident.
Tom thinks it's pretty good.
Tom said he and Mary had a fight this morning.
Tom may be lying.
I heard Tom's living in Australia.
Nobody told me I wasn't supposed to park there.
Tom could have taken the money.
Tom doubted that Mary would keep her promise.
Make sure no one enters.
I doubt that will ever change.
Tom told everyone he was bored.
It was clear Tom was going to do that with Mary.
I suspect Tom is drunk.
I met someone yesterday who knows that we do.
Tom told me he didn't have insurance.
I hope I can live here with you.
These agenda items were taken up for discussion.
Tom said he felt good about that.
I suspect Tom and Mary know something interesting is about to happen.
You know I have to do that, don't you?
They must have found out who I was.
I don't think I passed the test.
I knew Tom was a bad loser.
I don't think Tom's dead.
They said they didn't feel anything.
I knew Tom would like Mary.
I don't think Tom would be afraid to do that if you did it with him.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't be able to win.
My impression of America is very good.
I don't like anyone bothering when I'm working.
They remained friends.
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be back soon.
Tom said he wished he hadn't allowed Mary to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary was having fun.
Tom said he thought Mary didn't like John very much.
I don't think Tom can do that without any help.
It's not difficult to do that.
I'm very sorry I kissed Tom.
I'm terrified.
Tom told me he was very hungry when he got home.
Tom said Mary would probably not know how to do that.
I don't think Tom knows he's supposed to do that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were planning to do that.
Tom said he heard three shots fired.
I think you're stuck up.
Didn't you know Tom had a dog?
I knew Tom wouldn't want to stop doing that.
Tom and Mary told me they lied.
Tom's a bully, just like John is.
I'm sure Tom that was going to happen.
I'm a friend of Tom's.
I thought Tom would have forgotten me right now.
They say they're working very hard.
I don't think Tom knows if Mary likes him or not.
I don't think I can move to Boston until next year.
The only person who could have done this is Tom.
They told me they were good.
I thought if I broke up with you, I would never have to see you again.
I'm decorating the classroom.
I know Tom knew that Mary wanted to do that.
Tom and Mary said they were depressed.
Tom knows I don't like him.
I know Tom doesn't know that I have to do that.
Tom said I should have left earlier.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could have done that by himself.
Tom said he thought he forgot to lock the door.
It's hard to do that, isn't it?
The present I got from Tom was the best.
I don't think I have enough money.
Tom wasn't given the chance that you and I were given.
How did you know Tom was planning to do that?
Will you give me one pen?
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet.
I feel like I've been here before.
Tom was rude to everyone.
Tom said Mary is probably still alive.
What's the stupidest thing you've ever done?
Tom and Mary didn't tell anyone they'd won the lottery.
Is there any possibility that Tom will want to do that with us?
Tom and Mary both like old movies.
Tom and Mary said they could do that today.
Tom woke up the kids and told them to get ready for school.
I don't like you.
Tom said he thought Mary would be hungry.
Tom said that Mary thought John might not want to do that by himself.
I didn't know you were planning to do that while you were in Australia.
I don't think Tom's riding his motorcycle anymore.
Tom said he doesn't feel like doing that.
I know Tom doesn't know why I did that on Monday.
Tom should have done that.
I don't think Tom knows that he'll never be able to do that.
I can't stand the noise anymore.
I know Tom didn't know we wouldn't be able to do that.
I hope you already know what to do.
Didn't I tell you I wouldn't go to Australia?
Tom said he thought it would be better if we didn't do that here.
Tom said he didn't want to leave.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be home.
You're a better chess player than me.
Tom said he liked the idea.
I'm going to watch TV tonight.
I think Tom's a few months older than Mary is.
I think you already know Tom.
I should have kissed Tom.
I know Tom knows why I need to do that.
I'm sorry I opened your mail by mistake.
Tom thought Mary wasn't finished doing that yet.
I wonder if Tom was able to do that.
If I had taken that plane, I wouldn't be alive now.
I don't think Tom would like this movie.
I'm sure your intentions are honorable.
I know Tom's about the same weight as I am.
Tom said he didn't know why the meeting was postponed.
You should have taken his advice.
They say they like to do that.
I know someone needs to do that.
Tom told me Mary wasn't afraid to do that.
I hope Tom isn't tired.
They said they were conservative.
I don't think I'm gonna be scared.
I know Tom can't do that even if he says he can.
We could have done it by ourselves.
I thought maybe you'd have an idea.
Tom and Mary said they were heartbroken.
I wonder if Tom really is home.
I know Tom knows I'm not supposed to do that.
Tom and I haven't done that yet.
Don't pick your nose.
I have to do something with these radishes.
Tom pledged guilty and was deported.
I didn't know you needed to do that.
Tom says he's planning to stay in Australia as long as he can.
I don't think there's any way I can help you.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't forgive him.
I don't think I can help you do that.
I know Tom's the kind of guy who would do that.
I suspect Tom will help Mary do that.
Tom said he didn't know how Mary would do that.
I won't tell anyone you're in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to do that alone.
Tom said Mary didn't look too worried.
Tom can swim much faster than Mary.
Tom would have done that right the first time if you had helped him.
I'm used to cold weather.
I think Tom hurt his leg.
I know Tom didn't know he should.
The current political situation is not very stable.
Tom said his son was a good athlete.
Tom and Mary said they weren't jealous.
Tom's contract expires on October 20.
I don't think Tom would be nervous about that.
I know Tom's a Red Cross volunteer.
I knew Tom wouldn't do what we asked him to do.
They told me they were ready to do that.
I don't think Tom really did that all by himself.
How did you know Tom was going to be in Australia all week?
I thought Tom wasn't surprised.
I thought you said we weren't going to sing.
They said they'll do that soon.
I know that the last thing you want to do is hurt me.
I can't believe you wanted to do that.
I have the impression that Tom is doing well.
Tom didn't know Mary was John's girlfriend.
They said they were very sick.
I know Tom did that once.
Tom's waiting.
I think both Tom and Mary have never done that.
I knew I should have studied French.
Tom said you're stubborn.
Maybe next time!
I think Tom's lying.
I know Tom knows I shouldn't be doing that.
I thought you might be in Australia this week.
I'm sorry I made you wait so long today.
Tom thinks Mary is glad that that's going to happen.
It is not until you get sick that you realize the value of good health.
I thought I broke my leg, but a X-ray showed I didn't.
Tom said he wasn't aware that Mary had done that.
There's not much we can do to help.
I don't think Tom understood what we wanted him to do.
I don't know what it is.
I wonder if Tom knew I had to do that.
I doubt the police are going to arrest Tom.
I've lived here for thirty years.
Tom told me he hated doing that.
Tom said he thought I was dead.
Tom said I don't have to do that.

I don't think Tom liked your song very much.
I would have done that if I could.

Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be cooperative.
Something's very wrong here.
I didn't know Tom lived in the dormitory.
I thought you'd like to see this.
Tom told me he wasn't planning on joining the team.
I hope Tom's happy that's gonna happen.
They told me they'd probably do that.
Tom and Mary told me they were free.
Tom said Mary would probably go to Australia with him.
Tom wouldn't have done that even if he wanted to.
Boston isn't like Chicago at all.
I really should have told Tom not to go to Boston.
I think my neighbor may have died.
I don't think Tom's done that yet.
I don't think Tom would be late unless he had a very good reason.
Tom's cooking.
Tom said he thought Mary would be cold.
Tom said he thought we could win.
I don't trust governments.
I didn't think there was anyone I knew in Australia.
Do you think I should go to Australia with Tom?

I don't think Tom's gonna be a problem anymore.
Didn't you know Tom was Mary's brother?
I don't think I know that guy.
Tom said he was planning on going on Monday.
I'm afraid I might be late.
I put on my helmet.
Tom was afraid his parents would start asking him questions and that he would end up telling them everything.
I knew Tom would be able to do that if he really needed to.
Tom thinks you're gonna be here tomorrow.
Everyone knows Tom's lying.
Tom must have seen it.
Tom may be a traitor.
I knew Tom would unlikely agree to do that.
They must have arrived home by this time.
Tom told me he's going to talk to Mary about that.
I thought you weren't going to tell anyone.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's shoe size is.
She'll do that if nobody stops her.
Put your guns down!
She's my first love.
In summer, eggs soon go bad.
I've taught my dog to sit up and beg.
I promise I won't tell anyone where it is.
Tom thought we shouldn't go.
Tom's not as fat as I am.
Nobody's listening anymore.
I thought you were Tom's friend.
They said they felt very lonely.
I don't think I'm unlucky.
Tom announced that he wasn't going to do that.
Tom should really have stayed where he was.
Tom thinks Mary won't teach French.
Tom told me he was fine.

Have you ever been stuck in an elevator?
Tom said he tried to be optimistic.

Doing that will be a lot harder than you think.
Tom said he didn't mean to hit me.
All hope abandons you who enter here.
I'll see if Tom's in his office.
Tom and Mary said they prefer red wine.
Tom and Mary say they may not have to do that.
I hope you know that the last thing I want to do is hurt you.
You're better than me.
I wonder if Tom's gonna be okay.
Since my husband got sick he's lost 20 kilograms and his pants are now baggy.
Tom's never had a problem with anyone.
Tom would have eaten more if he had time.
I think I'd like that.
Tom said he thought he'd be able to do that on October 20.
I know that deep down you're a good person.
Tom assumed that everyone at school knew he had been arrested.
Tom said Mary doesn't think John will do that to Alice.
There is no doubt that I couldn't do it without your help.
I wish I didn't have to throw this away.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary has to do that.
Do you think Tom would like to camp with us next weekend?
Do I have to answer in English?
I think Tom hasn't agreed to do that.

Tom said he had to work on October 20th.
Tom said he thought Mary was unhappy in Australia.
I want you to know that I will work very hard.
Tom looks older than he really is.
Tom told me he thought Mary was lazy.
I have a lot of work to do before I can go home.
All we can do now is hope that Tom will do what he's promised to do.
I haven't read it.
I don't think Tom really wants to do that anymore.
I thought you didn't want to talk about this.
They have a green carpet in the living room.
Tom said everyone he knows enjoys doing that.
You're next in line for promotion.
Didn't you know Tom used to be married to Mary?
Tom said he liked to do that.
Tom and Mary swore they didn't do that.
I know Tom doesn't know why he should do that.
Tom must have gone ahead.
Tom thought it over carefully.
The police suspect Tom was murdered.
I doubt that Tom is still unconscious.
I know Tom's not used to sitting on the floor.
I've created a few websites.
Tom said Mary likes to drive.
We're trying to close the box.

Tom said he hasn't done any of that yet.
I think Tom's over thirty.
I didn't know you were planning to do that so soon.
We should have done what you advised.
I thought you said you hated doing that.
Tom told me he wasn't an expert.
I know Tom wouldn't ask Mary not to do that.
Christmas is just around the corner.
Tom is not very likely to want to do that.
Tom's the smartest person I've ever met.
A man called you last night.
I'm a little drunk.
They're not as tough as they look.
I guess this is a step in the right direction.
I'll make sure Tom does that sometime today.
Tom fell in love with Mary the first time he saw her.
I haven't understood anything you've said.
You should have left while you had the chance.
I thought you said you had a dog.
No one's out of the woods yet.
Tom said we could go to Boston with him if we wanted to.
That won't change anything.
Tom's being mean.
We didn't know Tom was going to do that.
I didn't know you were still planning to do that.
Hi, everybody!
I don't think anyone would agree to do that.
Tom couldn't believe his vacation was over so fast.
You can't make bricks without straw.
I don't play tennis as much as I used to.
Tom said Mary wouldn't probably be mad.

I'm bored out of my mind.
Tom should have done what Mary told him to do.
Tom is someone you can trust.
I knew Tom told Mary not to do that.
Tom and Mary say they'll help us today.
I'll stay home if it rains tomorrow.
If I had done my best, I might have succeeded.
I know that both Tom and Mary have finished doing that.
Tom would have done that if you had asked him to.
I know Tom's a lot smarter than Mary is.
How much did you spend per day when you were in Australia?
I hope I can do that.
I meant it when I said I wanted to marry you.
I don't think anyone was satisfied.
Looks like someone's ripped a page out of this book.
I knew Tom didn't know you were the one who had done that.
I don't think Tom has time to talk to you now.
I think you shouldn't have done that by yourself.
He's a man who gets things done.
I hope you'll be my friends.
Tom said he wanted to try riding a unicole.
I thought you might know why Tom left early.
Tom assumed everyone knew he had spent time in prison.
Tell me who your friends are, and I'll tell you who you are.
They said they were very worried.
They told me they were hungry.
It'll be done by the time you get here.
Tom may not have died in the accident.
Tom said he thought he'd be able to find another job.
I thought that only happened in fairy tales.
I don't think Tom was busy today.
Tom said he assumed Mary wouldn't cry.
I'll be there on the twentieth.
I don't think it's likely Tom will help us.
Tom must have cried.
Tom's lost both of his parents.
Tom said he could have done that on his own.

I didn't know Tom would be able to do that alone.
Tom may be desperate.
The road is parallel to the river.
I suspect Tom and Mary know that something interesting is about to happen.

Tom said Mary's not pessimistic.
I'd like to report a crime.
I didn't know Tom didn't know French.
I know Tom didn't know I knew how to do that.
Tom told me that I should do that soon.
I'm afraid I can't help you.
I know I'm not alone.
They're not as innocent as they seem.

They may do that if they want to.
I know Tom's a very shy boy.

Tom said he doesn't think Mary really had to go yesterday morning.
I promise you I won't be late.

I wonder if the weather will hold.
It would have been romantic to do that.

For here, please.

I know Tom can swim better than I can.
Tom and Mary told me they had to go.

Good job, everybody.

Tom's big-headed.
I don't think I should tell Tom I'm going to Boston.
He likes to play football.

Tom thought the burning car would explode.
Do you really think Tom's determined to do that?
Tom could be in Australia for a long time.
I think Tom could do that if he tried.
No one knew you were in Australia.
No one's been injured yet.
I don't think it's up to us to decide.
You're handsome.
This is the first time I've been riding a horse.
They said that they like to do that.
Stand back, please.
Tom tried hard to calm everyone down.
We all wondered why she dumped such a nice man.
Those who know me know I can't do that.
The first time I held my girlfriend's hand was on the school bus.
Tom said Mary thought John might want to do that early tomorrow morning.
Tom already knows that Mary is planning to stay in Australia for another three days.
How many kilos have you lost so far?

I don't believe you can speak Hebrew.
I know Tom knows that Mary doesn't want to do that.
What color is it?
I can say please and thank you, but that's where my knowledge of German ends.
Tom thinks some of his friends might do that.
When she came to the place where the footsteps led across the moor, she found small pools of water, and a lot of mud, so she threw the loaf into the mud, and trampled on it, that she might pass without weting her feet.
Tom thought Mary did that with purpose.
Tom must have been showing up.
Tom was paid more than he expected to be paid.
This blackboard is not black, but green.
Everyone waited.

Please wait thirty minutes.
