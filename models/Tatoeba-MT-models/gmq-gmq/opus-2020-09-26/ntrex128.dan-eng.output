Politicians in Wales afraid to "like fools"
There was a horror among some members of the National Assembly in Wales over a proposal that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament (Walisian Parliament).
AMs from the whole political spectrum are concerned that the change of names could cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because "it rhymes on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means foolish, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru Party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Walesian conservative said that his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that there is only a short verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (they).
In this context, the Walisian letter w is expressed in the same way as the letter u is spoken in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently compiling a legislative proposal on the introduction of the name changes, said: "The final decision on names that Members of Parliament will receive, of course, is up to Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals in which there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred the Members of the Welsh Parliament (walisian MEPs) or WMPs, but the MWP was given the greatest support in a public consultation.
The AMs seem to suggest alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement can prove difficult for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to compile a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislative proposal on reforms contains other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs will have the final vote on what to call them when the legislative proposal is debated.
Macedonians vote on the change of the country's name
The voters vote on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is held in an attempt to solve a decade of conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, whose province is called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that their northern neighbour's name constitutes a requirement in the territory of Greece and has long protested against Macedonia's attempt to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President Görge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says that he will defeat the vote.
The voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just a price paid to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's stay quiet while the churches in Harlem fight
"The older people I have spoken with said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there's none of the things."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"People socialize in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Barer is no longer the neighborhood living room where people enter on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from selling assets will not last long and that they "before or later will be back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people who do not help the neighborhood's returning shelter.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy ownerial apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further to the development where these churches finally close entirely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the ownership apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A local black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycot of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who would not hire or promote black.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parish children planned to restore the building, they ordered the bell game.
The priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the bell game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first bell game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't find a replacement for him.
What has been happening in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs. Some of them have been captured by church leaders, others of the Bispedømme.
The Congregation Council, the leading body of leading laymen, wrote in July to the Bispedømme on the concerns that the Bispedømme "will try to push the costs forward" to the Congregation Council, although the Congregation Council had not been involved in recruiting the architects and entrepreneurs sent in by the Bispedømme.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency by the Bispedømme.
Sharks hurt 13-year-old on a diver tour for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy when he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, says officials.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just excitement to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy cried out, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"All his collar legs were ripped up," said Hammel, "he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried that everyone should get out of the water, 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flying to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
It's not known what kind of shark that attacked.
The lifeguard Larry Giles said in a media survey that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to his upper torso.
Officials closed the access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to carry out studies.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to take the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in the style of large magazines.
As part of a great effort to adopt the UK Beauty Market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow while fashion and housing products valve. The larger rows of beauty products are tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in several stores next year, if they prove to be a success.
The investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets are looking for new products for shelves that were previously used for television, microwaves and housing products.
Sainsbury's says they double their selection of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas in the style of those you see in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also relancers the range of Boutique makeup, so the majority of products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the perfume store is testing Fragrance Shop boder in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the other opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later in the year.
Online shopping and a development against the purchase of small quantities of food daily in local merchants means that supermarkets must do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores will look like large magazines, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of daily goods and have made the purchases more profitable.
The former attempts made by the supermarket to update the beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a common approach with Boots in the early 00s, but the cooperation ended with a argument about how the income of the pharmacies in the supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns Lloyds Pharmacy chain, 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxurious skin care fires such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and decoration of our rows of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of fires is designed to suit all needs and the intake environment and practical locations means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "smart", after Holly Willoughby retires from agreement to GBP 11 million
Dragons' Denstjerne Peter Jones left behind "razy", after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to 11 million GBP with his lifestyle fire to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for their home product and accessories fire Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop fire.
This morning host, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she's leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Denstar Peter Jones furious after she retires from their lucrative lifestyle fire at the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "razy", when the popular TV woman during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – with a value of up to 1.5 million GBP – meant that she had no longer enough time for their home product and accessories fire Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop fire and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones fled out of Britain to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she had to deal with for the next few decades.
Her decision to retire surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in the Marlow headquarters, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the release from this Morning host, which is among Britain's highest earnings stars, can cost the company several million due to large investment in products – from pillows to candles to clothing and housing products – and the potential for further delays in launching.
And that can also end a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and master Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman of the board in March.
The two pairs go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to be a brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as a host at I'm A celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business actions."
Tough talk, "and then we fell in love"
He made fun of the criticism he would get from the news media to give a comment that "is not a president worthy" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parodi on a news host.
"I didn't give up."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diploma Ri Yong Ho told on Saturday the world leaders of the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "equivalent reaction" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial approach to disarmament.
He noted that instead the United States continues with sanctions designed to keep pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in the speech of his electorate.
"Northern Korea is doing really well," he said.
"There was an outfit for war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim had created positive results – the end of rocket tests, the release of hostages and the return of earthly residues from American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach in relation to Kim.
"It is so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this close-packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said and pointed to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquakes ravage the island and kill several hundred
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombox's population were homeless, there was no national state of disaster, which is a prerequisite for the call for international emergency aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been clear that they do not request international assistance, so it is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children compile a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the national emergency response, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency aid.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami refugees have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common view of other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunamisir is missing, and this has likely affected the death rate.
Even under the best conditions it is challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's lacking infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
However, Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by the lack of funding in the course of the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko also experiences pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge equals in the last moment against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea's target while his team was behind with 1-0.
He pricked the ball with his left foot before he made a high shot against the remotest pole.
The ball flew high across the field to the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position to get the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to get as far forward as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came, and I made a single touch, and I didn't think so much about it, and I just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the half game, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker returned with his heel to Mateo Kovacic before he picked up the middle course and swept into Liverpool's track half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the middle track.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and finished against the remotest pole with a shot with left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the Champions League at 15 Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo, Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europe Leaguge at 15 Thursday in London.
Death from tsunami in Indonesia is rising to 832
The number of deaths from Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunami has increased to 832 reports the country’s emergency preparedness early on Sunday.
There were reports of many trapped in the wall docks from buildings that fell after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the richter scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by wallbreaks from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man under suspicion of murder after a woman is stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has begun after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.

I would also urge all, especially taxi drivers who may have recorded something with dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that may be crucial to the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman arrived on the site to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police state that they are informing the victim's relatives.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but gets to know from the police that no one can get into the building.
He was lame when he heard what happened.
The people are now told that there are hours to come back in.
A police officer was overheard to tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman is arriving.
She keeps repeating, "It's so horrible."

A number of police officers were in the lock-up and watched the apartment complex.
Anyone with information should write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and inform log 247 on 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the last memorial of discussion on the "rewrite of history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic puritanic consequences.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "insanity" and an "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in connection with the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would be a goal.
The image storm during the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for his forefather Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing image of Cromwell is a testimony to attitudes in the 19th century and a part of historic history for a figure that many still think it is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is a precise mapping is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is absolutely certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the battle.
His achievements like Lord Protector are also worth commemorating and commemorating."
Killer pigs attack and kill Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China according to local media reports.
The man who is identified only under his surname "Yuan" was found dead with an overwhelmed artery and embedded in blood near a pig path on the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had supposedly traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig stand next door was open.
He said there was a big pork with blood in his mouth in the pig stain.
According to the report, a judicial investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had bit the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said the cousin who goes under the surname "Wu" in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police collect evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rare units, but there are previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg mustered a Walesian farmer against his tractor, to his wife frightened the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News told me that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just medical.
They're napping, they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa is expected to give heavy rain in large parts of the southwestern USA
As predicted, the hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves across the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rain with floods in northern Mexico and southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had wins at 38 m/s, a category 1-orkan, at 10 Sunday (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north Sunday.
At the same time, a low - pressure evaporation over the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula Monday as a tropical storm, it begins pushing tropical moisture towards north into the southwest United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure outlet coming closer and create heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will cause dangerous storm floods, liquid downfalls and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern USA, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is great probability of storm floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the spread nature of the tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn gaps into buzzing rivers and thunder will create powerful local winds and create dust blow.</seg>
The low pressure outlet approaching will bring heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of more than 13 mm, which can give less volumes of liquid drops and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region during their raintime.
Spread tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area Four Corners Tuesday and continue Wednesday.
In October there may be great temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic is getting cooler, but there remains fairly warm in the troops.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central US Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern USA are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 °C from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern regions.</seg>
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern USA in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million saw Thursday's gripping testimony from the nominated to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, at six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle with stations that interrupted the general programmes to tell about Friday's late development: an agreement composed by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake, which allowed the FBI to carry out a weeklong investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Judgmentary Committee that she's 100% sure that Kavanaugh in drunk condition was on her and tried to take her clothes off for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, 20.4 million people were likely to see it on Friday.
The company counted average viewing numbers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available viewing numbers from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems with measuring how many people see programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's a viewer number that corresponds to a match during the NFL playoffs or Oscar award.
Fox News Channel, whose perceptive hosts have strongly backed up the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, said Nielsen.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office sent out a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning, while demonstrators shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing of the judiciary committee.
He stood with a downward look for several minutes while he was mocked out, and CNN sent live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had sent out a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say in the committee hearing.
All the television stations covered live a few hours later, when the Judgmentary Committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a vote for the whole Senate.
However, Flake said that he would only vote in favour under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominated one in the following week, which the Democrats, who are in the minority of the Senate, had sought.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's elections had an influence because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation on Kavanaugh.
United Kingdom Prime Minister accuses critics of "to play politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU for "to play politics" with the future of Britain and undermine the national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservatives' party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, presented her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal for the United Kingdom and the European Union to collect each other's tariffs was "whole ridiculous".
Shotshots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspected to be behind the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect for the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of negligent murder, said the Baton Rouge police.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported the CBS daughter company WAFB.
After the interrogation of Simpson, the police said he had confessed to the shooting on Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The Legal Medic in East Baton Rouge Parish sent out a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a wound from a gun shot that went from the head to the neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, the state police lab, the Southern University police and citizens of the area have assisted with the investigation leading to the arrest.
The sports leader at the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "consciousness and chasing for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
Friday morning the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said that the team is "knocked" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"That's the kind you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Vulcan spies ash over Mexico City
Ash spit from the Volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after there was activity in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center watched the rumble and shaking over several rounds.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in the neighbourhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital, since an earthquake, which measured 7.1 on the richter scale, shaked the central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police meet with Catalan separatists before the anniversary for the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrators who wish to be independent, encountered with alarm officers as thousands participated in rival demonstrations that marked the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on liberation.
A group of masked separatists held unreasonable officers back, threw with and powder paint and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There was also fighting later on the day when the police used their spells to keep the fights down.
Over hours, independent groups shouted "No forgotten, nothing forgiven" and were met with Unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, reported local press.
The voice remains high in the independent region one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid, but celebrated by separatist catalans.
The electorate voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the electorate's agreement was low, and those who were against the breakdown were largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop holding the vote during violent clashes at voting places throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night to Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer dare hope that Catalonia can gain independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy over having the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they gained a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have fought to maintain the momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved themselves into exile or are in custody and are awaiting judgment for their role in holding the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, took up the protests on his phone in support of the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There are growing tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have waited for his trial since last year, announced that he would attend the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"The appointment as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to avoid the reversal of democratic values and the subjugation we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.

A bracelet may have been fired at some point.
Menga shots give Livingston a victory of 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The Livingston recipes surprised Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team pulled up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won on the outdoor track in the league in this season and will meet the leading team Hearts, which they are eight points after, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be visited by Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, expands their unconquered stripe for six matches, and Chief Coach Holt has still not got a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cash outlets
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, and their direct playing style created big problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the target, then Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-border header in front of the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could give the abstinence problems in death-fighting situations.
And it was under those conditions that the important objective came.
Declan Gallagher and Robinson created the plan for Menga, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball but struggled to get through the defense of the home team, and Liam Kelly, a target, was virtually not challenged.
This pattern continued in the second half game, although Alfredo Morelos had a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was prevented with the feet of Rangers the target Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame in another of Livingston's death ball situations.
Continuous deliveries came into Livingston's field, but were prevented, and two demands for penalties – after Halkett's tackling on the replacement Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal efforts and strong results for Livingston.
Everyone played fantastic and exceeds the expectations of their upward journey.
Their play style and troops are virtually unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he entered.
There were many heroes.
Commander Halkett was amazing and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toes throughout the fight.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played under level.
Their ends lacked sharpness – only once they got their home team exposed – and it is a rapid wake-up for Rangers, which is in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Køln
There were smiles and blue sky Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreements on areas such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's approach to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Køln to open a new large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police held for security reasons a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but lots of supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of the Kurdish – also noticed and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept in the country.
Competitive protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero of some German Turks and ridiculed as an autokrate of others.
Accident on the way in Deptford: Bikelist dies in automobile crashes
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwestern part of town around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were more rescues in the place, but the man died on the ground.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver escaped from the site, at Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that police officers were working on identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Road barriers have been set up, bus routes have been changed, and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison, six officers injured in trouble.
Six prison officers have been injured in trouble in a high-security prison, according to Prison Office.
There was trouble in the prison HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 9.30 BST Sunday, and the turmoil is still in progress.
Specialized "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the riots that involve eight prisoners and are on one flight of the prison.
The police were treated for minor face damage on the ground.
One spokesman of the Prison Service said: "Especially trained prison staff are inmates to deal with the ongoing disturbances in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that the responsible are reported to the police and can end up spending longer behind prisons."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated at the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, unhappy officers were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances where employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with a storm flood (large areas can take advantage)
It is rare that a tropical low pressure strikes Arizona, but it is most likely at the beginning of the next week when the rest of the hurricane Rosa moves across the desert landscape of the southwestern USA and creates a risk of storm flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about the storm flood for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ti tropical cyclones had preserved the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km from the border to Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm rain with isolated quantities up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, will probably get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of the storm flood, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the southwestern USA is currently experiencing drought.</seg>
According to the American drought Monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category", reports weather.com.
First, hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum wind power of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north by 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore valleys in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The raining over parts of Mexico can become strong and give high risk of flooding.
"There is expected to be rainfall on a total of 76 to 152 mm from Baja California to the northwest Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the border to Arizona early in the morning Tuesday as tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the residues of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the United States," reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to create life - threatening storm floods and floating downfalls in deserts and landslides in mountain terrain.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for murder attempts
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested suspicious of murder attempts, after a 16-year-old was found with plug wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton about 4 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital, where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, states the police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have called on everyone who might have mobile recordings of the events to arrive.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was subject to the "badness and wrath" of the democratic party.
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and monstrous tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a electorate meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been exposed to "the evil, anger" from the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a testimony in front of the Congress Thursday, and he strongly and emotionally denyed accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he was interfering with her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a testimony at the hearing on his accusations.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote on the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that confirms one of the most skilled legal brains of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the Republicans meeting at the votes at the mid-term elections.
"In five weeks is one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
You can't vote on me, but you're actually voting on me," he said.
"That's why I'm traveling around and fighting for amazing candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "straight against and block."
The first important procedure vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a person high in the Republican Party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, the number of deaths grow
At least 384 were killed, and many of them washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a great earthquake and a great tsunami hit the Indonesian island Sulawesi, said authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at dawn time, sucked many in death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake that measured 7.5 on the richter scale.
"When the tsunamitrus arose yesterday, people were still running activities on the beach. They did not run immediately and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia's disaster response GDPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami came not alone, the dragged cars, tree tribes, houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho and added that the tsunami had moved through the open sea by 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
More survived by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16.700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The catastrophe preparedness has published air photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and crashed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afterdowns continued to shake the coastal town Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be marked in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Board for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in an announcement that the energy triggered during the great earthquake of Friday was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "inclusive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found firmly clipped under the wall docks from collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 had been injured and 29 reported missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and injuries could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
"There are more than 300,000 living here," said the Red Cross in an announcement and added that their employees and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The Board was criticized on Saturday from many fronts not to state that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the time when the warning was issued.
In amateur recordings shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building that desperately shouts warnings about the Tsuami coming closer to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and cars carry buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a major power failure that cut the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun to send freight planes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reports authorities, but food and basic needs are still needed among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for help work, and remains locked in until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision's employees from Donggala have come safely to Palu City, where employees seek shelter during pastures set up in the courtyard at their account. They came past areas with extensive destructions on the road, said Doseba.
"They told me that so many ruined houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid organizations began to resume the aid work, it was complained that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian legislation, financial aid, supplies and staff from abroad may only enter if the area where the accident has occurred is declared national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at province level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for Indonesian red cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it is a national disaster', we can open up international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the other night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people held fast in the hope that their closest would be the miracles that illuminate the sad tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers liberated a woman who had been trapped under bricks for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglides to Asian Games, who ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
"As a vet in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how in the hours, after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who attended the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted in only one grey flue bone instead of two blue.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he says.
Twenty take 26.750 USD while filling the machine in Newport on the Levee
Twenty stole on Friday morning $26.750 from a Brink's Aunt who was about to meet a machine in Newport on the Leveee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied the machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "back at the Brink's staff" and stole a bag money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects who escaped from the site, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the thieves, please contact the Newport police of 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote, "The Being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had the nickname Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place prior to his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He's replacing songs Ariana Grande on the show that canceled for "feeling reasons," said the designer of the show.
The name is a shortening of his current artist name, but West has said earlier that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier in the year, when he discussed his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused pages, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported to prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former collaborators, JAY-Z, has also changed between lower and upper letters and changed whether the boundary is included.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military power against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military power against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th year for a bloody retaliation action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he " never would ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
Troops shot at a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 300 at a time when left-oriented student movements struck roots in many parts of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of training opportunities involve young people in criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in the field, says investor and AI users Kai-Fu Lee, who have worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come, after various parts of the US government have announced artificial intelligence, but the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the first place in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind compared to the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough within AI," Lee said.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances that the next major performance in artificial intelligence is achieved in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is the Executive Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest ranked American Othello player, and later he became the leader of Microsoft Research and Director of Google Department in China.
Lee acknowledged former technological competitions supported by the US Government, such as Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get legats from the government, says Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically have offered work permits.
China State Council issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organisations’ distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Department established a common center of artificial intelligence, which must involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative named AI Next.
NSF is currently investing more than 100 million USD a year in research in artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation, which is trying to establish a National Safety Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has stood still for several months.
Macedonians vote on the change of the country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted on whether their country's name should be changed to "The North Macedonia", an action which would solve a decade of conflict with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's efforts to achieve membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbouring country towards the north constitutes a requirement in Greek territory and has therefore used their vetoret when Macedonia has sought to join NATO and the European Union.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian predominantly Slavic population.
President Gerge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote, and a boycot campaign has raised doubts whether the voter will represent the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the vote was, "Are you for NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU's umbrella because it means more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote and make it gældende.
The change of names would require a majority in Parliament of two thirds.
The Electoral Commission said that at 13 a.m. no irregularities had been reported.
However, the participation in elections was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the latest parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change of the country’s name, which would open up to membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje prepared Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, a small scene and pulled chairs up in front of tents set up by those who want to boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want membership with travelled foreheads, not at the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn against others like China and Russia and become part of the European Asian integration."
Mr Zaev, Prime Minister, says that NATO membership would give a strong demand for investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think a large majority will vote in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving up his vote.
He said a "yes" result would be a "security of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the vote – fewer than the required participation in elections.
Another opinion poll made by the Macedonian television channel Telma TV indicated that 57% of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these 70 per cent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the participation in elections must be at least 50 % plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the proven government since it entered in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero fights through the entire Brighton Army and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton Army in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculous with his score that came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a delivery on the middle track at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before he hung out on the open track.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought himself past one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of the Brighton field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to overlist the Brighton target Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola reporters.
"We talked about him playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a target at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate forefront of the Premier League game.
That goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in the sequence the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a great delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before he led Sterling to the remotest pole.
Sky Blues-forwarden pricked the ball in the net just before it slipped past targets.

Scherzer's gonna mess with Rockies.
Nationals have been eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the castu Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still possible participation in playoffs for Rockies, who have played a game more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies at least stuck in a wild card slot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals Friday evening, but still enjoy their first division title.
"Although we have nothing to play for, we can go to the battle well knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the highest level I will face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
Nationals have not yet subscribed to the start exhibition for Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer as pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who wanted to be the first man on the plate for 34th time, trained his throws Tuesday and wanted to pitch on Sunday, which normally is his rest day.
The right hand player from Washington is located on 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings in this season.
Trump holds electorate meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation of his elections to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the Republicans meeting at the votes at the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big – you can't vote on me, but you're actually voting on me. That's why I'm traveling around and fighting for amazing candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this horrible, horrible radical group of democrats, you can see, it is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power with all available means. You can see how evil, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have as a mission "straight against and blocking."
"And you have seen it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "wrought and evil, and disgusting and lying."
He referred to the supreme democratic senator in the Senate's Judgmentary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, by name, which triggered a loud bow from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, wait a minute – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant to those expressing their views
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to censure me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a number of Members of the Labour Party who have been told that we are not welcome – only because we have made our opinion known.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she strongly opposed antisemitism.
In my case, the censur measures were to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Concerning the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems which Jeremy disagreed with former leaders in.
In the call for the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a local parliamentary member, Friday evening meetings have just been like this.
Today, the tone of many meetings is unfortunately not that way, and the promise of "friendly, gentle" policy is far back in the past if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that deviating views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed by whether the management of the party can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader when colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared my political stand began to expect me to make an U-turn and adopt attitudes that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was about national security or the European Union's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and it doesn't matter what I say – a long series of gross messages follow on the social media that encourages the abection and contradiction of the middle-seeking policy and tells me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and for the willingness of the colleagues who are being overwhelmed every day with sexism or racism, but yet fight on.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is where normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour was to create a tolerant culture.
In reality, however, it is no longer a spacious organization and with every mistrust vote or change selection rules, the party becomes smaller.
I have received a lot of advice over the past two years about that if I lay a lid on myself and I'm not so loudly shouting, I'm going to be "just fine."
But that's not why I joined politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago, when I went to school, I was provoked by the lack of thatcher government, who had left our classroom in a fallen state, and I decided to create better public services for those who need it most – whether it was as a council member or minister of the government.
I've never hidden my policy, neither in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country is rolling towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of Labour.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local electorate, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no kind of threat of election or political suitability will prevent me from acting on the basis of what I think is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr becomes top team
Two late scores may have made the final result of drawing a not completely true image, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazing entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only unconquered team of ten.
In the end, it was as much their superior defense as their better use of chances that carried the home team home, and Coach Peter Murchie had the absolute right to be satisfied.
"Our struggles have been demanding so far, and we are still unconquered, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to the Scottish team player Rory Hughes, who was distributed to the battle of Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a penalty kick just before the half-game. He scored and then got a soloscorn, so there was 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half game, and Patrick Anderson's score, followed up by a kick from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out of the field on the bar. When the game was resumed, Ayr precipitated with a score from Stafford McDowall and a subsequent kick from Climo.
Working Ayr-general Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and again Melrose exploited their extra husband with a score from Bruce Colvine without following kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson was able to score after a line-out score behind the forward Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the poles and followed up with a more shortly after, the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe caught up David Armstrong's box kick and sent the wing player Gregor Henry to the homeway's fifth score.
Still Game star looking for new career in the restoration industry
The Still Game Star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restoration industry, after it came out that he has taken the director post of an authorised restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main person in with his partner Greg Hemphil.
The Duo has announced that the coming nineth season will be the last season of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": Inland State Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen route to the Pacific
Seamen patrol around the Navy headquarters, enclosed in riches, in La Paz.
On public buildings there's a sea blue flag.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overshadowed with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It is a duty to take it back."
In the whole country of the inland state Bolivia, the reminder of a coastal route lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century, is still strong, and the same is the desire to sail to the Pacific again.
The hopes may be at their highest for decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of vote.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course waiting with a positive look at the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will agree that Chile – after decades of discussions – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who faces a controversial election fight next year, also has much to do with the judgment on Monday.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised last August.
However, analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take the side of Bolivia – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, has no power to transpose the Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice judges only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given a relapse.
"The case of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," said Zárate.
Morales' warrior rhetoric has done away with the remaining Chilean charity, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision taken by the Court was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an exceptional opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "finish an era of 139 years of disagreement and gain advantages for both parties", he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless they can trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never destroy their nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington first.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made at a Singapore Summit between the rival leaders.
His comments were made in addition to the fact that the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo apparently faces a reboot of the locked nuclear diploma over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "wanted dream" that continued sanctions and the US's opposition to a declaration that ends the Korean war will ever bring North Korea to the knees.
Washington is refraining from declaring as long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps to combat disarmament.
Both Kim and the American President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism in relation to whether Pyongyang is serious in relation to the abolition of an arsenal, which the country is likely to see as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Modeshows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headwear that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted on the catwalk blur for a collection of remarkable headwear in extra large size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated on Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their striking creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work from Valentino was an overwhelming with a feather-like broad shadow covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had merged lips that reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like a snorkeled diver with a mask, and others looked like a melted waffle.
And if you continue the big fashionstatements, you're lucky.
Stils scouts predict that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The giant hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 cm wide shadow, seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark, which is behind the most impractical hat that was spread across the social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw, almost as large as the model that shows it.
The orange bast box with bast fryses and a white leather handle was the most impressive in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in ordinary stores next summer. The designer has had such a great influence that it will be hard to ignore demand for accessories in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many great academic results behind them, and it has continued in 2018 with a number of other outstanding exams, which are even strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best service level to their students and parents.
The independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As a training sector that can compile and implement a tailored course, we experience that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it hits the heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest exam results this year, that languages are at the highest in statistics with most passing exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS 74 members' schools showed that 72 per cent of the students received the grade A in mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French, and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now seen as topical choices at the same level as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' courses and elsewhere.
A study carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 concluded that among the reasons why employers were unable to occupy vacancies had 17 % to do with lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills become increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
Several job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The possibility to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a precedence to competitors to a multilingual person.
According to a YouGov opinion measurement with over 4,000 interviews in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children give you a better chance to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools differ between the languages in which they are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important for the United Kingdom when looking forward to 2020, for example mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose between in independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scotish independent schools are dedicated to delivering a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to succeed, whatever the future offers.
At the moment it cannot be denied that languages continue to be truly important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and that must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this award to Scotland's youth.
Il faut the bee le faire.
John Edward is Head of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets the debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who will see LeBron James play his first fight for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James plays in Sunday's opening game before season starts against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet fixed how many minutes he plays.
"It becomes more than 1 and less than 48", said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won't play the whole game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' planned six matches before the season start.
"Where I'm in my career I don't have to fight before season start to get ready," he said.
Trumps electorate meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of electorate meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first out of five planned electorate meetings next week, including meetings in Trump friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump's appointed judge to the seat of the Supreme Court is suspended, Trump is trying to support the forthcoming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are delivered in November.
When is Trump's electorate meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's electorate meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is held at midnight (Danish time) night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's electorate meeting in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court. The hearings were tense due to the charges of sexually offended behaviour, and the expected vote in the Senate for confirmation has been settled for a week while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the primary objective of this series of electorate meetings is to create momentum for the Republicans who are facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that the five electorate meetings next week are aimed at "creating energy among volunteers and supporting when the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible now that we enter the busy campaign time", said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, which would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
The evening's electorate meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to arm up to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, who is engaged in state science at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown battle and tries to keep hope alive before Sunday's single doves
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday's four-man dueller might be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendul is a fully invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this.
So where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we probably see it a little as momentum," said Jordan Spieth before he held four nights.
Of course, Europe has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 points left to play.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and set a good example for his teammates.
The high Jubilees were higher as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important pillar that secured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two beats behind after two dueller.
His pillow, which secured them the fight on hole 15 was encountered with a similar scream – the kind of screaming that shows that he does not think the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just have to find the inner strength forward and focus on your own fight," said Spieth.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the biggest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange, but sympathetic couples have got four points in four matches and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bookey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bookeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way energy seems to flow both to and from the wild audience shows that it is them it will be the hardest to beat Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory is determined by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Especially synchronously on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process against Sergio Garcia, the morning in the four-man duellers when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A booky and two double bookeys on the first nine holes dug the Spanish and the Swede into a hole they were never near getting out of.
Sunday no one can help you out of your hole.
The matches with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to look at close due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy lightly can change.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant leadership before the last day, but four-man duellers have also shown that Team USA has the fight spirit that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates leadership of 10-6 prior to last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day of Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's four balls and foursomes with a lead over the USA of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and has so far got four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the pokal they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over an impractical American team in the four-balls of the morning and won the 3-1 series.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes. They won four games, but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 single games if they want to keep the pocal.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari who have been given the nickname "Molliwood" together after a sensational weekend is just another couple in Ryder Cup's history who have won four points in their first four matches.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls and then elegantly defeated a discouraged Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through the first two games Saturday, had little brilliant glimpse, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning's four balls and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and got a 2-1-sea over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which is number three in the world.
However, Europe has everything they want on a light blowing day southwest of Paris.
Three-fold major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points Saturday.
They got a hard-fighted 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls and later returned to Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup story that a team has fought back after being behind with four points before single matches. Since Furyks currently has the pocal, they only have to achieve a level to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that they cannot cope with a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they won't destroy unilaterally if there is no trust.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations Saturday that continued sanctions strengthen their distrust to the United States and that the country will not give up their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the Worldwide Organisation that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" in the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling an area for nuclear testing and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and technology.
"We have not, however, seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first steps and unilaterally deplete."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-divided" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech seemed important, as it did not unilateral disarmament unilateral disarmament, as it had otherwise been the case in the past from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint announcement from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work "Atom Disarmament on the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has requested a formal conclusion of the Korean war, which began in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also shown opposition to softening international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'atom disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by force and even opposes 'the declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The understanding that sanctions can break our knees is a dream among people who do not know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions strengthen our distrust."
Mr Ri mentioned no more plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, as the American leader pointed out at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If nuclear disarmament was to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so locked up."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris' speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that fire of North Korea's missiles against the American mainland was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on suicide mission.
Last year Trump threatened the United Nations with "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he commended Kim for showing courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that the sanctions need to remain until North Korea devotes.
Wednesday Trump said that he did not have a schedule for these actions, but said "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain the sanctions with conviction and without failure until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline during the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea just a few hours after accused him of making "good demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile system and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent steps."
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent steps" he required were the security promises that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements towards a normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture, where you study all night with large amounts of caffeine.
A researcher has shown that students at the world's best university often don't know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he thinks is the first of his kind in the United States.
He got the idea of the course after holding a post on the effects of sleep shortages on learning.
"When the program was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I know this only now when I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits can improve your academic and sporting performance and your overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of the University's Health Area, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in severe sleep shortages during the week.
The hourly course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a college room where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to get knowledge of the effects of caffeine and light, and how your sports performance is affected by sleep shortages and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course the participants hear about how sleep shortages over a long time increase the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to consider their daily habits by clicking on various icons on an interactive map of campus.
"We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health", adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is in taking a "all nights" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on students has caused sleep shortages to be a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and sufficient sleep, he said – it counteracts even weight gain, because sleep shortages make the brain think that you are starving, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to organize the course when he took one of his courses at his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and made him work to make it a general course at the entire university.
He hopes that the next thing will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before they continue their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends the students to set an alarm so they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light of electronic screens that can move at the day's rhythm and make it more difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Targets from Menga lower Gerrard and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the outskirts as Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's inconsistent team had to take account of a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was looking for their first victory on the field since 4-1-triumphen at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard only another defeat in 18 matches as a coach. Thus there are eight points up to Hearts at the first place of Ladbroke's Premiership.
Menga hit to seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond to.
Rangers are now going down to a sixth place, while Livingston climbs up on a third place after Hibernian, with only the goal of difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, as line judges Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object, which seemed to come from the outdoor section.
Gerrard made eight changes in the setup that reached Betfed Cups semifinale by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, stood with the same 11, who shaved a point of Heart's leadership last week, and he would have been delighted to see his sharp team exhausted the opponents all over the field.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should've scored two minutes in the game when Menga's first delivery sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goals, but the middle-level player's attempt passed by.
A freespark in depth from Keaghan Jacobs found the way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow kicked past the back pole.
However, Rangers took control, but played more hope than ability in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was at least unhappy when Judge Steven Thomson failed the Columbian's appeals to the penalties when he and Steven Lawless crashed together after a quarter of a game.
Rangers only succeeded in two shots on target in the first half, but former Rangers target Liam Kelly did not have any problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head impact and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Although the opening of Livis in the 34th minute was something random, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Once again, Rangers couldn't handle a death ball situation in the depth of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga who could easily kick it in target.
In the break, Gerrard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave pot when the flying player sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the ban to play on their pretexts with many long balls up the path from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the last part of the game, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with the safe hand before Lithgow headed next to target.
Rangers' subcontractor Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late penalty kick after being torn down with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Yearbook: The inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from the Yearbook "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we TELL... – was the day when the future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention to lead in the long term to the device known as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a solid component of both science and popular culture, as could be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the main roles as farm scientists:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity of the minerals makes."
Evans, "Oh, come on, it's going on!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have been 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and change them in the laboratory.
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine survives promisingly in patients with a number of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them into the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein named HER2, as many cancer forms have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "makes several cancer forms to develop", including breast, ovarian, lung and intestinal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach in which immune cells are taken out of patients and “learning” them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL behaviour.
It didn't go well.
After an inconsistent performance in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was bowed off when he commended the United States president Donald Trump, and said that he himself would be presidential candidate in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the evening Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again chasing, he started a thunder talk against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved away from the United States long ago," he said.
SNL started the evening show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's Legal Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's assault charge.
Even if the recordings were not displayed, the comedian Chris Rock Wests uploaded their tiring on the social media.
It's not sure if Rock tried to exhibit West by putting up the tapes.
West also complained to the audience about poor treatment backstage because of his headwear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat on.'
They mocked me!
And they said I had fallen deeply," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Would you like to see how deep I'm down?" and said that he would put on his Superman robe because it means "you can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try love."
The audience buhed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff appeared to be embarrassingly affected, explains Variety with a comment from a person present: "There was missed in the study."
West had been booked as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose then boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many by performing with the song I Love It while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the Conservative Group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the brave people: Thank you for not letting you out of the poof."
Talkshow host Karen Hunter tweeted that West just "is like he is, and it's all right."
"But I do NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his " art" which embraces and pours out an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so have we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he has taken the name change to the "entity which is officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, so he follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Rap Collegiate Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased musical Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Accused of murder attempts by stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is accused of murder attempts after a man was stabbed on a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.

The charges shall be reviewed by the public prosecutor.
The game of Thrones star Kit Harington is pushing for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging the sword in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor is hanging out for the stereotypic macho hero and says that such TV characters mean that young men often feel that they must be hard to be respected.
Kit said to Sunday Times Culture that he believes that something has gone wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones-medstar Rose Leslie in 31, admitted that the problem lies with him "very much in mind."
"At the moment, I am very concerned – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, then what have we taught young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He went on to say, "What is born, and what is taught?
What are the young men learning from television and the streets that make them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think it is one of our time's big questions – how do we change it?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong with the young men."
During the interview he also admitted that he will not make successors to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said that he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
Kit participates from November in a replay of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film instructor and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose as the best part of the Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so that has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, which Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's countryside in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been hit, says the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40 000 new cases were recorded.
The vast majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way has been reduced to something near zero, the Chinese health authorities tell at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
In 1997 homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT individuals is supposed to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will soon marry women because of their conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of Maxine Waters' House of Representatives denied in Saturday's accusations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claimed that the allegations originated from websites and support from "the outer right wing".
"Lies, lies and more horrible lies," wrote Waters in a Twitter lookup.
The published information contained supposedly home addresses and phone numbers of the American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was placed on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill. This occurred during a hearing in the Senate involving accusations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court-nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been posted by the people of Waters, and then published information about a member of the Waters staff, writes The Hill.
"This unjustified accusation is completely false and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"Member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unjustified accusation is completely false and a direct lie."
Waters' outline quickly received criticism online, including from former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's a angry denial," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she does not have the right temper to be a Congressman.
If you're accused of anything you haven't done, don't get angry.
You can't be disobeyed.
You must not question the causes of the accused.
You have to stay calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare the response of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats on Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate aiming to take over Waters' seat in the mid-term elections, also made his opinion known on Twitter.
"Big if it's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official announcement, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the orderly authorities regarding these deceptive allegations."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for their actions which are destructive and dangerous to all and everyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English strikes again – underwhelming spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all newer films with a British ice cream, and it also seems relevant for the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and showed up again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will dry, sarcastic self-satisfaction about how much we have to do become the country's new export option?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes have been given his permission to make roars renewed again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic invention directed towards places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife-headed Mr. Bean and a proper clap of him who performed a single tone to Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international sloppy pants who left chaos in his cooling water after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television advertisements.
There are some good moments in this latest shot on the tribe of JE.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers clinged to his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but the humor feels quite underwhelming and strangely overnecessary, especially now that more "serious" movie series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The humour seems to be targeting children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy adventure is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent films in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An Internet hacker has infiltrated England's top-secret spy network and revealed the identity of all the English agents in the field to the horror of the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a pompous and combat-ready Prime Minister who is already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
Since her security counselors inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she is forced to cancel someone's pension.
And, of course, it's the clumsy Johnny English who is now inspector at a high school, but who in hiding teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for some kind of school of Rock education in spying.
English hastened back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunites with its hard-tested previous right hand Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now married an overenthusiastic but well-intended submarine captain – a role that Vicki Pepperdine was played on.
Thus the Royal Intelligence's all-accompaniment Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatal, Ophilia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is stunningly close to letting itself smudge by the karismatic and creepy tech-milliardary Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their ragely risky eskapaders: Disguised as servants, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired off in the final sequence of the movie, but no matter how well-intended and energetic it is, there is a feeling of child television over it.
Pretty moderate.
And as I could not avoid thinking with the other Johnny English movies: Can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to work with a four-day working week plan with unchanged salary to the British
Jeremy Corbyns Labour is said to consider a radical plan, so that the British can justify a four-day working week, but get paid for five.
The party will claim to have business managers to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that the employees would have three days of the weekend without going down in wages.
Sources say that the idea would be in line with the party's economic objective of drawing the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a change of economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to the Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits the party's approach to changing the economy to the benefits of the workers and to the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea as the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign in 2017.
However, the objective is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
One spokesman of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not the policy of the party and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent last week's party meeting drawing up his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell states that he is determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "use" in supply companies.
The shadow finance minister's plans also question whether the current shareholders of water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with the head of Labour could "modify" them in the light of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to obtain employees in company boards and to set up, including ownership funds, which are to distribute 10 % of the share value of private companies to employees who will receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice.
The FBI investigation on accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week, and that raises the question of whether the FBI fund could cause the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went into the hearing, I said I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, "Did you do it?"
He was steel-shaped, decisive and unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, seems to be measled in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett strongly denied it," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the ones she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it should change anything."
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York is the host city of Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
Global Citizens Festival will receive for the seventh time tens of thousands of people on Central Park's large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal of ending extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of Global Poverty Project, an international interest organisation that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert walkers must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a telephone call or another meaningful action that can bring attention to the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been now that they have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Creates the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" – i.e. people feel that they make a difference by signing a signature collection on the web or making a Twitter lookup?
Global Citizen states that since 2011 they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their members targeting different objectives.
They believe that these actions have motivated world leaders to set binding objectives and political measures equivalent to more than $37 billion, which in 2030 is expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 objectives and actions that had been created due to their actions, which amounted to more than $10 billion that had already been paid out or collected.
The Group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has been started in England and is a collaboration between investors and trade strong people. They strive to "help children to endure their full potential" and promise 35 million dollars to remedy nutritional problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4.700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books," said the ambassador of the Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that the Government of England has now promised funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
In answer to one of the website's frequently asked questions, saying: "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?",
wrote Global Citizen: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the movements against apartheid, it will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers of this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are to be hosts.
The United States can use its fleet to "block" for Russian energy exports, says the U.S. Minister of Interior
"If necessary," Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from coming into the market, including in the Middle East, revealing the U.S. Minister of Home Affairs, Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where they operate on invitation from the legal government – is a pretext to expand the sales of their energy.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he must have said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States has the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the seaways, and if necessary, we can also block them, so that we ensure that their energy does not come on the market", he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a nonprofit organisation that considers itself "the voice of the American energy consumer" –.
He compared Washington's approach to handling Russia and Iran and said that they are basically the same.
"The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel," he said while referring to Russia as a one-trick pony whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing European exports of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is the very cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, spokesmen of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2-line project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin the "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion animal North Stream 2 line, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is merely an economic project.
Kreml considers that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is merely due to economic considerations.
"I believe that we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose a supplier," said the Russian Minister for Energy, Alexander Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the US Minister for Energy, Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party intervening in our energy supplies," said the leader of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "reasons heavily" to attend presidential elections in 2020," says the Senator of Massachusetts.
Senator in Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "reasons heavily" to attend the presidential election after the mid-term election, she said Saturday.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering to take part.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it takes a woman in front," says The Hill.
"After 6 November, I would strongly consider making the presidential elections."
Warren made his opinion about President Donald Trump known under the City Council and said that he "leads the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been expressed in his criticism of Trump and his highest court-nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, the FBI has to investigate the case before the vote."
However, an opinion poll from Thursday shows that most of Warren's own country does not believe that she is going to set up in 2020.
According to a poll from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not set up.
32% supported the potential candidateship.
The opinion measurement showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick by 38% for and 48% for a possible setup.
Other highly-profiled democratic candidates discussed in the context of the presidential elections in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The Biden pronounces that he will notify his final decision in January, writes the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at a electorate meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with violence at home.
"What my own son is going through, after he has come home, makes me able to relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers return with," she told the audience to a Trump picker meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and have become harder. They go and wonder if there is respect for it, their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with violence at home against a woman, to prevent the notification of violence at home and to possess a weapon in drunk state, says Dan Bennet, a spokesman of the Wasillas police.
18 States and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 States and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new American law refusing asylum to victims who flee from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered on Friday in Washington a party-dependent declaration in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, says NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace vs. sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal law has not been published.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but American officials refused her asylum application on 20 July.
She was held in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers originated as countries with far-reaching problems with gangs and violence in their homes.
The new U.S. asylum legislation rejected a decision by the U.S. Foreign Board in 2014 allowing undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia State Advocate, Karl Racine, stated on Friday that the new law "is disregarding decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle", states the party-dependent declaration.
The lawyers also argued in the declaration that the law of rejection of immigrants harms the US economy, as it is more likely that they will become self-employed and "supply the necessary workforce".
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Session's immigration judges deprived the right to provide asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or a political stand," said the Sessions in his announcement of the law on 11 June.
It has never been meant that asylum should resolve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
While the death rate doubles, the attempts to find survivors in Palu are desperate.
For survivors, the situation was only worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she comforted her little feverish boy at a evacuation center in the devastated town of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We need clean water."
The inhabitants returned to their devastated homes to sort in wet possessions and to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals that were also hit by the earthquake of 7.5 could not follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke their backs and shoulder, were outside the Palus military hospital, where patients are treated outdoorly due to severe postquakes.
He got tears in his eyes when he told me how the violent earthquake shaked the hotel room in the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was masturbated against a broken wall, I think," Haris said to the Associated Press and added that his family was going to be a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife shouting for help, but then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
American Ambassador accuses China of unfinished methods and propaganda ads
One week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page announcement in an American newspaper that hit the drums for the benefits of an American-Chinese cooperation, accuses the American ambassador of China Beijing to use the American press to spread propaganda.
The US President, Donald Trump, referred Wednesday to China Dailys paying indentation in Des Moines Register – Iowas best selling newspaper – after accusing China of interfering in the 6 November Congress elections. China rejects the accusation.
American officials say to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the American election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to announce to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, where they have imposed customs duties on each other's import goods.
China's retaliation duties in the trade war were to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, believes Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, American ambassador in China, former governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China "upgrades the use of the infinite methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, however, there will be only few disagreements, and you will not get a fair picture of the Chinese people's different attitudes to China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under strict control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans alienate women before mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, warns analysts
While many top republics support and defend the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh against accusations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the coming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The case has put the emotions in place, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This can't be done again," said Grant Reher, Professor of State Knowledge at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said that he doubts that the Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona) request for an FBI investigation for 11 hours will milden wrath electorate.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they don't forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill on Friday.
Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted at a demonstration in the Senate: "November comes!" when the Republicans, who control the judicial committee, chose to go on with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," told the independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"People say that it has already reached a high level; it is true.
But it can now be even higher, especially among female wings in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29 years old – who rarely vote, despite not liking the president."
Even before Ford's public accusations on the sexual abuse of the Supreme Court of Justice, analysts had pointed out that it could cause a relapse if the Republicans continued to nominate.
"It has become a mess for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the committee or the final outcome, or whether Kavanaugh is held responsible; it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with this and how they have dealt with her," points out Guy Cecil, President of Priorities USA – a group supporting Democrats in being elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views on who they should believe after the testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41% of the interrogators certainly or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said that they certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought that Kavanaugh was either probably or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the accusations presented by Ford and at least another one, Deborah Ramirez writes for the Guardian.
Ford told her last week under oath to the Senate's Legal Committee that Kavanaugh in full acted on her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Judiciary showed her her sex parts at a party when they both studied at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the Internet is planning to create a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech doctor is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "the dominion of the world."
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up business.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt is, according to the company's Executive Director, John Bruce, to gather resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralized apps by using the available tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook or Google about whether to change everything completely so that all their business models suddenly become unnecessary."
"We don't ask their permission."
In a report on the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet that is built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: The clergy receiver of the Victoria Cross from World War I is commended
The only priest of the Church of England, who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I, is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Wann won the order on 29 September, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday a memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was "incredibly symbolic", that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's order-winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Vann on 29 September 1918 led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery."
Later, he ran to the front line and led with the "major manhood" of his people before he alone attacked an artillery-made and unharmed three cannons.
Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Water of 72 said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also made a wreath after the parade, which was directed by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've stayed up all night to see the starspicked Bellator 206 and then you won't see the main event.
There were 13 matches on the program from San Jose, including six matches on the main programme, and they were shown throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6:00 in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until early morning for just this fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to a child drawing movie as "a kind of sick joke."
" According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., why they had to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior service president when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Grisen Gurli, yes."
Bellator's Executive Director, Scott Coker, stated that they will work to include English viewers in the future.
"When thinking about the re-transmission, I think we can make it work," said Coker.
"But it's six Sunday morning over there, and we won't find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the change was made, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all kind.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But that was actually the law.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We're just enough with five games instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "smaller" over sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt less worth than anyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize until he got into the major classes that "they're not all like me."
When he was at Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give other "hopes".
He also said that he was less concerned with winning Olympics after becoming a parent.
The usual host of the radio program, which has been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because of disease.
Daley was a guest of the Lavers' first program and said that he felt "less worth" than everyone else in his upbringing, because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said: "Until today, the emotions of feeling worthwhile and feeling different were the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they got to know his sexuality.
The double Olympic Bronze Winder has become a highly profiled LGBT fighter and used its participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The triple world champion said he had been "absolved" when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, which he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He told me that it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar up and down trips when you go through so much in such a young age – he went to his first Olympics when 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said that "the whole of his perspective" had changed."
"If you had asked me last year, it would be all about whether I should win a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic Gold Medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 as a 40-year-old after having diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had received tickets to London 2012 – when he would sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and first I realized that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year Daley participated in OL 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a homepublic at the Olympic. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration of his first song elections – Proud of Heather Small – that had meant much during the uptight of the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs runs at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Uskarp Mickelson on the bench of Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the shape if it's not supposed to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who keeps record for the 12th time in the competition, which is settled every 2 years, was placed on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk because of Saturday's four balls and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the events of the United States as usual, the five-fold big winner had to act cheerleader and practice his game in the hope of rectifying the faces.
Even at the peak of his career, he had the most straight drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes lost shots.
And if the track was not a big enough mouthful, Mickelson at the 9th battle on Sunday must meet the always precise winner of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who start the 12 single games, start strong, Mickelson's fight can be crucial.
Fury did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, gave me a clapp on my back, laid his arm around me, and said that he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He's in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and this week too.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined that he was going to play more, but that's what happened, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Fallos beats the record for most played games in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully matched his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven undetermined, although Fury said that his presence contributes to something undefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, funny, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes with much more than just the game."
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
The European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup's single work can quickly become nervous.
The Danisher debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a forefront of five points over the Americans, but was about to be captured before the finish line with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice leadership in Valderrama, we had a nice leadership in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just won," says Björn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday to a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's gonna have full trash tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win the trophy, and that's where our focus lies.
I've always said that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side – the best golfers in the world."
Joyed with his players' achievements on a heavy course, Bear added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a completely new challenge.
Tomorrow it is the individual performance that counts, and that is something quite different.
It's amazing to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all the parameters as a golf player.
That's what the players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he will also have the best in himself."
Otherwise, it appears to the opponent Jim Furyk who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced coversions on the last day. First at the winning team in Brookline before he lost when Europe made the "Miraklet on Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 had spoken to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When the momentum has found a direction, it puts great pressure on the intermediate matches.
We compile our team in relation to it and put the players on the track in the order we feel for. We try to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the reversal and faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it ensures us all through," said Bear about his choice of single players.
Germany’s new warship is being postponed again
The latest fregate of the German fleet should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. But the Germans must wait at least one year further due to technical problems and an escalating price, writes local media.
The introduction of the largest ship in the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of fregatter, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, quoting a military spokesman.
The ship should have become part of the fleet in 2014, but compliance problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the Navy ordered back in 2007, will replace the ageing fregats from the Bremen class.
About them you know that they will have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature for the latest fregats is a small need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the fregats away from the home ports for up to two years.
However, the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are supposed to make Germany appear to be an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when they are inserted, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125-fregate created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for return, but German media mentioned a number of decisive "software and hardware failures" which made the warship useless in combat situations.
Software errors were of particular importance as the boats from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be controlled by 120 sailors – it is only half the crew from the older Bremen freegates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and reduced the fleet's possibility of future updates.
The 7000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project, including training of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached dizzying € 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), with an initial price of € 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregates are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Government's Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "runs out of deployable ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were removed without being replaced.
He complained that none of the fregates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust snipers to the secret life of the bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highland is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland National Trust and follows ordinary bats, dwarf bats, long eared bats and water flagermus at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed in select locations in the area to include the activities of the bats through the season.
Data from NTS and volunteers are also collected using handheld detectors.
Deep-depth analyses of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bat calls and show what kind does what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
NTS Rob Dewar’s natural conservation adviser hopes that the results reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen drastically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the nests and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and lighting may also pose a danger, and the same can be the case with flue traps, chemical treatment of building materials and pets attacks.
In fact, flake mice are not blind.
But because they are mainly hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echo placement technique to find insects and fly outside obstacles.
The NTS, responsible for preserving more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the bat very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect nests and sometimes make rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland’s first and only dedicated flagermus reserve in the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland’s bat species.
The area's manager, David Thompson, says that it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and the whole good habitat.
You know a lot about bats, so the work here and elsewhere can help to understand what they need to thrive."
He underlines the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on properties, since the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and kids, thereby risking extinction of an entire local population.
Flager mice are protected, and it is illegal to kill, annoy or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Project Manager for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bat, and for many of the species we have, we do not know how the populations develop."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him for "fake news" and says that people will "promotion themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
They say he paid her $375,000 to keep it secret, there Spiegel wrote on Friday.
Some hours after the claims had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and everything is good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they, according to Reuters, have called "an unforgivable publication of suspicions of the privacy sphere".
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class equivalent to the accusation, which probably is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event was supposed to take place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he must have raped her analt according to the submitted report in the City Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99% of the time" caught by "one percent".
The papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and photographed her injuries at a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "fear of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly devastated".
The 34-year-old now says that she will reverse the agreement because she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid, when the event should have taken place, and changed this summer to the Italian big club Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" losing car manufacturers
United Kingdom "will regret it forever", if it lost its status as leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxiety" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting at the border in the event of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% of these were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if the United Kingdom goes out of the EU at the end of March," said the Executive Director of Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers relates to risks related to the supply chain in the event of an uncontracted withdrawal.
Toyota's production runs on a tight timetable where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which, according to the automotive industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's production at the Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped, the company stated.
Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers' plan for future negotiations with the European Union is "composed to avoid these checks at the border exactly."
"We need an agreement. We want the best deal that allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to grasp this option," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers point out that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have been stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which will ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Vice-President Rod Rosenstein can "be postponed another week" as the summit around High Court-nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the special prosecutor Robert Mueller over his shoulder during his investigation of Russian election interference, relations between Trump's helpers and Russia and the President's possible obstacle to the course of the court.
If Trump will fire the vice-deputy Minister of Justice and thus risk Mueller's independence, it has been a gossip in Washington for months.
The New York Times earlier this month wrote that Rosenstein was considering carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deploying the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor was that he was going to quit.
Instead, a Thursday meeting was held with Trump, who was at that time at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "do not prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate's hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual abuse, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was at Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists would challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to the TV journalists' game for the gallery, but added: "I do not disagree that they play up to the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The President accepts more questions from the press than any president before him," she said and added without quoting a source: "We have looked at the numbers."
Press meetings will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to give it a rich opportunity, and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it will be in the place of the press meeting when you can speak with the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open hearings or press meetings with high-level guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the present journalists.
Minister for Health contacts EU staff in the Scottish Health Service after Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in the NHS of Scotland to express the country's gratitude and desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK retires from the European Union.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to pay for the applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal have continued, and it appears that decisions are expected for the autumn.
However, the British Government has also increased its preparation for a possible Brexit without an agreement.
I know this must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU come with valuable experiences and competences that strengthen and improve the work of the health services to the benefit of patients and the local community.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie is under acute surgery after head injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after having suffered a head damage in Saturday 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports from Tennessees Mike Organ.
First coach for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell around out there," Reed said.
Coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a bar and took him in for further investigation.
A spokesman from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are "no details of the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he caused the damage.
Abercrombie studies in the second year and is on his first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tacklings last Saturday before he left the game, which gives him 18 tacklings together this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp tax when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK. The extra money must, according to the conservative party, help the homeless.
This move must reduce Corbyn's success in attracting young electorate.
The higher stamp tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to get £120 million a year to the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy properties in the UK, in the interests of the homeless.
The draw will be considered an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and to go after them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The income from this should be used for the government's fight to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is added to the current stamp tax and higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases to rent, can reach 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, making prices rise and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot inside the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spooky towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new legislative proposal comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large building and construction companies to keep the property prices up by buying grounds they don't use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap dwellings to solve the UK's "short housing situation".
Corbyn has proposed an appreciative range of housing reforms, including the control of rent prices and the deduction of the tenant's opportunity to put people on the street if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing buildings.
May said: "Last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for each generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be true that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as hard-working British.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the inability of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland Coach."
The boss of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate goal" is at some point to become a Scotland coach.
The 42 shots enjoy the challenge of reviveing the North East club, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He switched to the Stadium of Light this summer after looking St. Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that was it," Ross BBC Scotland's Sportsound told.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always pulled me.
However, that possibility would only arise if I have successful training clubs."
Ross' predecessors as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says that he did not have any doubts about following so established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success based on whether 'I can get this club back in the Premier League."
From the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in his career as a trainer after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's coach.
Then he helped Alloa to come back after moving down into the third best row and transformed St. Mirren from the decommissioning threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real separation path," he remembers about the time in Alloa.
"I sincerely thought that the training work was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I did well, earned reasonablely and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are many things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
There's still the kind of stress and pressure that trains, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I do. I haven't felt more comfortable with myself throughout my adult life."
You can hear the entire interview at Sportsound on Sunday 30 September at Radio Scotland between 12.00 and 13.00 BST.
The best time for a beer is Saturdays at 5:30 p.m.
The heat wave this summer has increased profits for the pubs of England, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants have declined 4.8%, shows figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA and has collected the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpected long World Cup have meant that July follows June's pattern, where pubs experienced more sales of 2.8%, except that the restaurants have been harder hit now.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubes and bars focusing on the sale of beverages made it clear and experienced progress similar to the recession of restaurants.
Pubs focusing on food in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
On the cross of pubs and bar chains, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 % for the month, while food fell by 3.3 %."
Paul Newman, analysing the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the outside home market, the weather and major social or sports events are the main factors.
It is not surprising that restaurants are still fighting, even though a reduction in sales of 4.8% year after year will make real pain beyond increasing costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a hardly needed breathing room."
The total increase in sales total for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 % in July, which shows the fall in newly started fires.

Every five children have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
Every five children – up to 11 years of age – have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers are investigating.
A study of 20,000 school students in 4.-9. grade reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being added.
20% of the students said they had a "main account" that they can show their parents.
Every five children up to 11 years create accounts on the social media that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from 4th grade and forward reveals violent growth in "false Insta" accounts – a reference to the image sharing service Instagram.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being added.
20% of the students said that they have a "primary account" which they can show their parents while they also have private.
A mother who fell on her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a teenager who invited others to " rape me."
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40 % of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is scary that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics at the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athletic practicer, and President Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those who make decisions on sport to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great reputation in the athletic world in Scotland, Great Britain and the rest of the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her in the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the vote of athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help to identify a direction for sports in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four OL gold medals in the 200 and 400-metres races at the Olympic Ocean in Atlanta in 1996, and who are now often the commentator of the BBC, could not go after a transitory ischemical attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "A month ago, I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would show whether I would get on top of it and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm all right, I've learned to go again and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers to cows receive mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with a advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent chest pump", the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic music video-inspired advertising to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a costume that's filled with hay, to a song in which it's bla. says, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you see no tail" and "If you didn't notice it, this isn't outrageous, it's my breasts."
"Push it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bosom."
But the advertising that has been published on the company's Facebook page has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes fun of the "frights" of the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and feed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote a user.
Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a breast-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote: "Of course, traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added, "What an insensitive advertising."
Others defended the advertising, one woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I would have had one.
Breast-feeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad aimed at mothers pumping milk (often in their workplace or in toilets) and feels like 'cooks'.
It is not an advertisement that commends or criticizes the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they danced with the discrete pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the advertising is based on that many women who breast-feeding say that they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no pipes or snakes and fits discreetly in a breast-bh, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their children and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The Pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and milk cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while in an entertaining and recognizable way we showed the freedom that the new pump can give."
It's not the first time Elvie's pump made headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camp at Texas border
The number of retained migrant children has exploded, although the number of border gangs has not changed. This is partly due to a harder rhetoric and the Trump administration's scrapper laws that make it more difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their possibility of staying in the country by standing up and taking a child.
The return risk increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members should give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed to the Congress and said that they had arrested several people who sought to sponsor unrelated minors.
The management subsequently confirmed that 70% of the arrested had pure criminal records.
"Number of 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households stay illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to hunt those people," Albence said.
In the attempt to deal more quickly with the children's cases, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to meet in court within one month of their detention.
Many people use video calls instead of even meeting up and speaking their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those who are sentenced unjustified for residence shall be deported quickly.
The longer children stay in custody, the more likely they get anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or escape attempts, it says from help workers and in reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who call for better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced in larger installations such as Tornillo, where the size makes it more difficult to monitor whether a child suffers.
They added that relocation to a tent village without mental preparation or opportunity to say goodbye to friends can build up traumas that many already fight with.
Syria informs American, French and Turkish "employment forces" to withdraw immediately.
When the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the United Nations General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now its eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the stay of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the pretext of combating terrorism, and they will "be met with equivalent means."
"They must retire immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror "is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360.000 people have died since 2011 and several million have escaped from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this crucial war until we have cleared all Syrian areas" for both terrorist groups and "non-gal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn country.
In the field of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to return home, and then he accused "some Western countries" to "spread unjustified fear" which led the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these returns," he said.
"They police what was supposed to be a pure humanitarian affair."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no help will be provided to rebuild the country before there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to create a buffer zone in the last great rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
Because of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack from Syrian forces supported by Russia was avoided against the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will go after jihadists from the Nusrafront, a source group of Al-Qaeda, which will "be destroyed".
The UN mandate Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee to draw up a postwar Constitution for Syria and to pave the way for election.
Moualem has laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee and states that the panel's work must be limited to "to review the legislation of the present Constitution" and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another presidential period.
Based on that logic, Trump will probably be re-elected in 2020, unless the court case and scandals end his presidential period before time, which many liberal viewers hope for.
In what will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end of a presidential period ever!"
At present, there is no sign of seer fatigue.
Since 2014, the best broadcast time has almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcast time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers with up to 3.5 million in evenings with great news.
"It's a spectacle that people are attracted to because it's nothing we understand," said Neal Baer, who leads the ABC drama Designed Survivor about a head of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress Building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and writer bag "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote on Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' Scovell said.
The chaos has a value of entertainment.
However, unlike any other television programs, the stories coming from Washington can determine the case between Roe and Wade whether refugee families can be reconciled and the world economy's health.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged anniversary.
And yet it's about more than being an enlightened citizen when you see six-hour panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's strutseed jacket for $15,000 ("dressed with hybris", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' live descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
At least I'll never see Super Mario the same way.
"Some of the things that make it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's rotating crew and daily surprises (clashes with N.F.L, commendation to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a paragraph, you're off.
When I got Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while he recorded CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate's judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
"I remember when we made all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Big sums find the way to the close mid-term elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money.
This recently enveloped suburban district in Pittsburg creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another seated congressman, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps with the new 17.
The cards were converted, after Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January, judged that the old district was illegally set up in the favor of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th district has started a fight for economic resources between the large parties committees, the Campaign of the Democrats Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a election with high attention in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seed has been on the hands of the Republicans for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China, but changed their minds
Diplomates noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners kicked out Trump's management team.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call leading American diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a announcement earlier in the month.
But only El Salvador was punished. They received about $ 140 million from the United States in 2017 to bla.narcotic control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials deployed a top conference on security and economic development, which should have continued last year's meeting, which was considered to be a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in the mid-September, the top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, thereby dropping the thoughts of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has to speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October to send a signal of the importance of the Americans at the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American emissaries went back secretly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard demands or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton of the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case described by three US officials, including two diplomats who wanted to talk about internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the basis of a condition of anonymity.
Know the story
The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to the investigation, which is substantial and publicly available evidence of.
It is said that Mueller will also investigate the question of whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the elections.
If Congress should come on new hands, Trump will probably be held responsible while he prepares to again meet the voters and, in time, a jury of his companions.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trumps are inevitable – and the same is true of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect the length of the fight to continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to deploy a state coup against Hitler, if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and did not take the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath thereafter.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history turns, and the irreversible march of democracy to or decreases.
The United States now faces several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Minister Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since this newspaper could notify that last year he had proposed to make hidden recordings of the president and contested his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is improper.
"How do we react if F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly implemented – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false evidence?
And, more importantly, will we at the mid-term election vote for a congress that will keep Trump responsible?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who once occupied my embassy’s homeland.
She survived, emigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath lights on the table with the garden cross.
How can I be anything but optimistic with that in my luggage?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic prior to the fight against SK Rapid Vienna
Rangers will receive SK Rapid Vienna on Thursday. After the impressive unfinished result in Spain against Villarreal earlier in the month, they will have a victory against the Austrians good opportunities to move on from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented the middle-level player Graham Dorrans from getting the season debut before the 2-2 fight against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the belief that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken the stick home, but in all, it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably best in the first half game, but we got out in the second half game and were the best team.
On Thursday, another big European evening will be.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last match. But with the audience behind us, I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
Last year has been hard because of all the things that have happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys are really enjoying it.
Hopefully we can go on now, put the last season behind us and make success."
Anxiety about pension saving makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the participants of the study had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared, few talked to the family about it.
Approximately half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported that they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent told me they talked to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they do nothing to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the United Nations's Life Insurance Activity.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not tell them in good time.
Use your adviser and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for costs.
Ask your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed by a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have an economy for it.
Get the legal documents fixed: take the legal struggles in the uproar.
Get a warrant so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and ensure that doctors and healthcare professionals comply with your wishes, in the event that you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also an economic mandate.
If so, you designate a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs medical attention and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergy?
Get all these details down in writing, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question about the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who's looking after the dog?
Get the plan in place."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami which on Friday hit the Indonesian city of Palu. It informs the authorities who expect the number of deaths to rise.
As the communications routes are out of line, emergency workers have not been able to receive information from the Donggala, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central-sulawesian province and is at the bottom of a narrow subway on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which had an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and the tsunami.
Donggala is a regent that extends over 300 km coastline on the northwestern part of the island Sulawesi.
The government, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the central-sulawesian economy, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but mainly takes place in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s disaster center, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically located on the so-called fire ring in the Pacific and regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December, which hit 14 countries and killed 226.000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, including more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and only in April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake that measured 6.8 hit south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, and triggered a tsunami that bragged on the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake that measured 7,5 hit one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit Pidie Jaya’s reign in Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was reminded of the deadly earthquakes and tsunami of 2004.
A tsunami was not triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the crashing buildings.
2018: Vigorous earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son was charged with violence at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska was arrested after suspicion of violence at home, obstacles to the notification of violence at home and to oppose arrest, according to the report that Saturday was issued by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a woman acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
The Palin is incarcerated in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a guarantee of $500 insecure, reports KTUU.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "unclearly not guilty," reports the network.
Palin is charged for three Class A offences that can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, which can lead to a sentence of a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin's been charged with offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault.
The case is currently under examination at the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, of preventing the notification of a violent crime at home and of arms possession in affected state in connection with the incident.
His boyfriend accused him of giving her a blow in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups after explaining his son's violent behaviour with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds died
At least 384 people have died, after an earthquake on Friday the Indonesian island Sulawesi.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication roads, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just south of central Sulawesi, which is the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media are circulating videos showing the moment where the earthquake hits.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami bragged to the coast.
Public Prosecutors are trying to get terrorist suspects in NYC sentenced to the rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to get the death penalty sentenced to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare punishment that was last sentenced for a crime in the state in 1953.
30-year-old Saipov used in October a rental car from the construction market Home Depot to perform an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were melted down.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious personal injury.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a government jury could present Saipov to an accused party with 22 points: below there were eight charges of murder involving gangsters, which are typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "inclusive planning and preparations," said the prosecutors and described Saipov's execution as "difficult, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, body injury and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the statement of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last set up the defendant in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up getting lifelong prison sentences in September 2009.
In 1953, a State case in New York was last sentenced to death, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced for spying on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on 19 June, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, did not show any evidence of regret in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said to the investigators that he was fine with his actions.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, told the cops.
He has denied himself guilty of the 22 points of the accusation.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they "of course were disappointed" in the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and lifelong imprisonment without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma for all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader stated that the politicians had to "tag the pressure" from the European sceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the European Union.
The private conservative Member Peter Bone said to the demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "been out now" if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May's challenge in creating a gathering in the deeply divided party is stressed by the conservative remainders participating in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track during attacks from both brexites, remains and the European Union.
Her allies insist that despite the relapse, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – and thus force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "caos".
For the show Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrape the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we'd be out now," he said.
The Minister of Wellingborough added, "I want to fight for Brexit, but we're going to scrape Chequers."
On the background of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight wars for being someone's subordinate.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone refused that the public's position should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely wrong."
The Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the wide population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and are making us elected.
Now drop the Chequers, and start listening.'
As a point of comment to May, she added: "Premier ministers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage told the inventory that the politicians should be able to "tag the pressure" if they fail the decision from the 2016 vote.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They want to betray Brexit, but we're gathered to tell them that we're not letting them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class, who is on the verge of betraying Brexit, can feel the pressure.
"We mobilise the armies here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-controlled and proud UK."
While marchers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour show in the city center.
Spread activists waving with Conservative Mot Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the security problems of the conservatives' party app before the meeting.
"It is the people who claim that they have control of the IT systems and technology to Canada, to border controls, to free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he said.
"It's ridiculous.
There is nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "reasons heavily" to join the presidential elections
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "is considering making a strong contribution to the presidential election" after the mid-term election in November.
According to Boston Globe, the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future at a council meeting on Saturday in the western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, has to try in November to achieve a re-election against the State Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, co-chairman of Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been wondered if she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the constituents at the City Hall since Trump took over the office.
A participant asked her if she was planning to join the presidential election.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front.
Arrest in case of shooting on LSU's Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced Saturday that Friday a suspect was arrested for the shooting at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
The Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help to identify a man on the recordings.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of the damages," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to the 247 sports media.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to have been present, possessing a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in the East Baton Rouge district custody.
Sims was a two meters high third year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played on average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's grand prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, after team orders gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a decisive role for the race.
From the leader position, Bottas got a good start and was close to defeating Hamilton completely when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in pit as the first, and let Hamilton fight the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went in a pit later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came again in front, when the Ferrari driver after any wheel contact had to reluctantly leave the inner court after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first round of his 21-year birthday.
Then he took the lead in a large part of the race, when in an attempt to close quickly, he failed to switch tyres to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to take the 44th round, but could not increase the speed of the last eight rounds, so Raikkonen secured the fourth place.
"It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did it amazing all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me pass.
The team did an incredible work to ensure both the first and second place," Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a electorate meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court-nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a constituent meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had given before the Senate's judicial committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "bad and disgusting and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days of the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leak, and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you that leaked it?
Remember her answer... was it you that leaked the document – "Oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hey, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added in a simulation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter of Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the comet according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and that's what I've done."
But her denial was not well received by the President, as during Saturday's electorate meeting said: "I tell you that it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the president's continued defense of the nominated judge to the Supreme Court, which has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, Trump suggested that the Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own case.
"They do not shun any means in their efforts to take back power.
You can see the wickedness, the abominations, they don't care who they have to drum to get power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made it up to you after Friday's Elite League's lost match against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants quickly got ahead with two targets of attack from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie remedyed on the home level before Dwyer again brought Giants in front.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the season's third Elite League downlay for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's battle in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the pages where Giants went out as winners in the three previous matches.
Dwyer set out for the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assistant from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as an assistant, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquaardt was behind Cownie's counterfeit at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants came ahead at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard recovered again with a fine measure at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen bring Dundee in front for the first time in the fight late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five matches, are home in Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
Airline leader died to ensure that hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
A flight leader in Indonesia is commended as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers came safely down to the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a major earthquake in the Friday Sulawesi island hit and triggered a tsunami.
Vigorous aftersquakes are still raging the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung’s colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the swift control tower in Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed back in his place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway, was safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was falling apart.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said according to the Australian ABC News that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are broken," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands, and the country's emergency preparedness informs that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number of deaths is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying emergency aid and supplies in.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News, "Every minute a new ambulance comes with more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the shops have been robbed."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to the CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what we are finding.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country military: "I ask you all to work 24 hours a day to perform all the tasks of evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier in the year, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the aeroplane that crashed into the lagoon of the Pacific of Micronesia now says that a man is missing, although it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the declining plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini states that Saturday afternoon could not locate a male passenger.
The airline announced that it cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Locals both helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline states that six passengers stayed in the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in a stable state.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of the events.
The airline and the U.S. Marine both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the landing path.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go in water to life to get to the emergency exits on the decreasing plane.
He said the crew panicked and shouted and that he had had a smaller head damage.
The U.S. Marine stated that sailors who were working to renovate a cab nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to ship persons on land before the plane sank at about 30 meters' depth.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 persons have died in accidents with PNG registered airlines during the last two decades but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analytics determine the timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his evidence on Saturday during the appeal for a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analytics in the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, gave testimony for hours as expert witnesses in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used teleinformation to combine the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several different cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, says The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time when he had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat in the testimony bar Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was "laughing because my truck was in Nashville".
Another disagreement was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defence is planned to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hiphop?
A hiphoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in Britain because of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York nanny sues couples after fire with "racist" text
A nanny in New York sues a couple for discrimination after having received a text message by an error from the mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they were racists but compared the action to 'extortion'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEJ, NOT A SORT PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice fired and said that their former nanny, like from African-American, had been bad at work, and that she instead expected a Philippine, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing the couple to receive compensation for the fire and compensation for $ 350 a day for the six months she should have lived with the family, although this was agreed without a contract.
"I would like to show them that you cannot allow yourself to do such a thing," she said to the newspaper Friday and added "I know that it is discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves with the fact that they are not racists and that the fire of Maurice was justified because they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after having offended her.
"My wife had come to send her something that she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been uncomfortable with, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case with "extortion" and that his wife had born two months before and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you really go after someone like that?
It is not very friendly," added the investment advisor.
Although the trial is still underway, the referendum has already depreciated the couple on social media and has devastated their behaviour and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publisher feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was admitted for publication, said about the letter: "It is hard to imagine being the one reading it for the first time before it was released.
It's pretty funny to read now when you know how popular Paddington was."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book on a little bear, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th year of the publication of the books was "bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of her success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to boast," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it felt almost as if you had a child that achieved something: you are proud of them, although it really is not your profit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say that it was Paddington's fault."
Say goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors in vain tried to save her life.
"Nad called at regular intervals to say it was really bad, and she probably didn't survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die in the next few minutes, and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll see you soon.
See you later.
The medicine she had been given to keep her heart in motion slowly lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now the body shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get myself together."
Finally, the mourning Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I had a tremendous sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Suffering Women Trying to Stop Suicide Jumps
Two women who have lost relatives for suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up maps on a welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he was depressed and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with a infected smile.
"His smile was known by everyone.
People said that his smile brightened the room."
But he stopped working before he died because he really felt bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he killed himself.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid it's spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people there's someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis' long-term friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her boyfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being sad or depressed or something," she said.
"Some days before Christmas he began to change.
When the kids opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic to them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unexplained while the FBI is initiating investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a limited time-limited study – we could perhaps get a little consensus," said the Flake last Saturday and added that he feared that the comet had fallen from the hind in the middle of the locked party-shaped situation.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican support have the FBI conducting their investigation?
Their restraint is due to timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, fail to succeed, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have elected to the highest judge of the country.
George W. Bush has called Senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush, and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI finishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and choose him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean jumpers 'falls' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean jumpers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Merger Ministry and said that there were 1.127 jumpers last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human smugglers contributed to the changed figures.
Pyongyang has not given any official comments.
In time, the vast majority of jumpers from North Korea are offered citizenship in South Korea.
The Government of South Korea states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border boiling up to North Korea, which is easier to cross than the highly guarded demilitarised zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the jumpers illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often forced homes.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still in war – has been significantly improved over the last few months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to talk about the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happens after the historic meeting in June between the US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea at a general level.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will devote ourselves on our own," said Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
The President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as Supreme Court Judge, for "hysterical" and said that his temper was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comment came in an interview Saturday to Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had acted like that, you would have called her hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the accusations that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when talking about his family and his years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "grotesque and a coordinated characterism" organised by the left wing that was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said that she thought that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was predecessed with the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after Clinton's and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi went around when she was asked whether she would try to bring Kavanaugh for a rigs right if he was confirmed and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that if he does not speak truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly rather in the court in which he sits now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in relation to Obama's health reform or the abortion case Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would revise certain former Supreme Judgment.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, presumed person must dispute a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it is not just wonderful'," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, months and years of anger that she's hiding over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I got great support by a woman who was boss, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and began to cry, she would say to the one she spoke to: "You might think that I am sorry because I cry.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight of men, where I often wept of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss, which I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll be happy that they caught you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Congress of the Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to having an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and retired as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she as well as herself could make up as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a very contemplated decision," she laughed to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the riot, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't participate unless she collected 2 million dollars.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" She thought.
When she gave a speech that she would not stand up, she was overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to travel money and reach out to electorate instead of electorate, and anger over sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
"Oh, you could think I got a nerve intercourse," Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
"You should think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what's going to be written on my grave stone?
"She cried"?
How the trade war between the United States and China can be an advantage for Beijing
The opening salves in the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and although the battle is far from over, divisions between countries can be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
The American President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by customsing important Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest escalation this week with new customs duties affecting goods for a value of $200 billion applies in principle to half of all goods imported to the USA from China.
Beijing has every time repayed, at the latest by adding a duty of 5-10 % to US goods for $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second-largest economy is probably not giving after just provisionally.
If it gets Washington to withdraw its demands, it means they give in, but for China's President, Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the American pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A fast decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a growth for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it is actually much more dangerous than it was thought," said Abigail Grace, research worker focusing on Asia at the thinking center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, believes Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready for the refugees to return and ask for help to build the country that has been destroyed by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Walid al-Moualem, said that the conditions in the country were in improvement.
"Today the situation is more stable and safe thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All conditions are now present for the refugees to return to the country that they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily lives and living.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped from the country since 2011, where the war began.
Another six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian Government welcomed help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped to support the rebellion.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup 2018 and beat the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on pair 3 on 16th hole, which made him lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari did well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who got 5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Number 1 on the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the baggage, Spainrd Sergio Garcia, became the most winning Europeans with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really glad to have the trophy back.
It is a team effort, and I am glad that I could help," said a emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the falcon forward to his countryman John Ram, who fell the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single match Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history on 13-21-3.
It's a funny statistics for one of the best golfers ever who's won 14 big titles, only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had all weekend problems finding the shape with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing show, "I'm proud of the boys, because they fought for the case.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe a countergame.
We lost.
The hat for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players really played good.
We want to regroup, and I want to work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and then we'll move on.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take the hat off.

Update of algae flower: Concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general declining algae concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, dispersion is reported in the area around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – which suggests that the concentration is falling.
The envelope of algae spreads across a coastline of 210 km from the northern Pinellas County to the southern Lee County.
There are less envelopes about 16 km from the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer than last week.
Flowers have also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations have been reported in or at sea in Pinellas County during the last week, low to high concentrations in the sea outside the Hillsborough County, background concentration to high concentrations in Manatee County, background concentration to high concentrations in or in the sea outside Sarasota County, background concentration to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background concentration to high concentrations in or in the sea outside Lee County and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are still reports of breathing difficulties in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No respiratory difficulties have been reported in Northwest Florida in the last week.
