Welsh MEPs do not want to appear as "muppets"
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, which is known today during the Am (Assembly Members), are not fully satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of the plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from the whole political spectrum fear that this can lead to ridicule.
A representative from the Labour Working Party explained his group was concerned because “it rhymes on Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means "dumb", and pwp means "wash".
A representative of the Wales Party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was “dissatisfied” and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Walesian part of the Conservative Party said that his group was ‘open’ for the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of the MWP is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which, in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British serpent for ‘dust’.
In this context, the walisic letter W is expressed in a similar way as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: “Of course, it is the Members themselves who have the last right of destination in relation to the name they are to be mentioned with.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Wales National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation which showed public support to rename the National Assembly to the Walisian Parliament.
With regard to the title of the representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parlaiment Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
The representatives seem to suggest other alternatives, but to make all parties come to an agreement can lead to headbreaks for President Elin Jones, who, according to the plan, will provide a legislative draft for the change of names in the next few weeks.
The Reform Legislation will include other changes in the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for the disqualification of representatives and the design of the Committee System.
The representatives have the last right to vote on what to call them when they debate the law.
Macedonians go to the electoral courts to determine whether to change the country’s name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia may vote on whether the name of their country is to be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is held in an attempt to solve a decade long dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in their territory and has on several occasions opposed its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Görge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the change of names, has said that he will ignore the vote.
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
The watches of St. Martin’s styles — Harlem’s crickets are wrestling
"The old people I talked to have told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner," says Adams.
"Now there is none of them."
He said the apostasy of the bars was understandable.
"People socially associate in other ways" today, he says.
"Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local community, which everyone visits regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he fears that the money from selling possessions will not last as long as the leaders believe; "And sooner or later they will be back at the beginning."
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment building full of the kind of people who do not want to help the neighborhood’s remaining shelter.
“Most of those buying apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only speed up the day when these churches must close the doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both cries were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis — Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A local black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin's got a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a bocott by dealers on 125th Street – one of Harlem’s main hand dealers – because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 made major damage to the building, and when Father Johnson’s parish children planned the reconstruction, they bought in a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that carillonet was “the poor people's church watches. ”
The expert who played the carillonet in July called it "a cultural tax" and "a irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillonet in the world played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillonet at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in the past few months is a complex interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of which have been hired by the church's playmanship and other of the Bispedømme.
The Church Council — the congregation’s leadership, composed of playmen — wrote to the Bispedømme in July about its concern that the Bispedømme would “try to force the cost ” of the church council, despite the fact that the Church Council had not been involved in the hiring of the architects or contractors sent by the Bispedømme.
Some parish children complained of lack of openness from the side of the Bispedømme.
Hail damages a thirteen - year - old lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and hurt a 13 - year - old boy when he showed up for lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and that he and a group of others swim over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he thought first that the boy shouted with enthusiasm over catching a lobster, but he realized as the boy cried out 'I was bitten!
I was bitten."
His whole collar leg was torn up, says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
"I cried that everyone should get out of the water, 'There is a shark in the water.'
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Warden Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious damage in the upper torso.
The authorities shut down beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most people are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to make its intake in the UK Beauty Care Market.
Sainsbury's challenger Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with commodities-like makeup and beauty shelves, manned by specially trained coworkers.
The expanded shelves are tested in 11 stores around the country as part of a powerful invasion in Britain’s 2.8 million beauty care market, which experiences constant growth while the sales of clothes and home items fall, and if the attempt proves to be successful, the concept will be expanded to more shops next year.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the supermarket efforts to find a new use of the place previously used for TV, microwave ovens and home articles.
Sainsbury's has said they're going to double the number of beauty care products they offer for 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the puppet has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get better place in marked brand areas, as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relancing its Boutique brand with essentially vegan products, because there is increasing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores. One opened in Croydon in South London last week, while the other opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online trade and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means that supermarkets must do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, has said that sales will gradually resemble more and more on a warehouse, as the supermarket will take up the fight against the cheap stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods except food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of shops, and has also introduced a series of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago, according to which this has increased the food sales and made the purchases more profitable.
The last attempt by the supermarket to upgrade the beauty care and pharmacovigilance departments was failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots early in the 21st century, but the cooperation was settled after a dispute on the distribution of the income from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold his 281 store chapters to Celesio, owner of Lloyd's Pharmacy pharmacy, GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxurious skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Trade Director, said: “We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty shelves to create more inviting environments for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained coworkers who will then be ready to give advice and help.
Our label committee is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical locations make us now a beauty career competitor representing a new trade experience.»
Peter Jones is “surprising” after Holly Willoughby retires from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' Denstar Peter Jones is supposed to be furious after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled off a 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessory mark, Truly.
Their Society was earlier compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s mark, Goop.
Willoughby (37), who is this morning's program manager, announced on Instagram that she's leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' Denstar Peter Jones angry by departing from their profitable lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on his own new golden-edged contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “razy” at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here the golden girl admitted that her new deals – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time for your clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The Society has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, and it was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced in Instagram that she is going to leave Truly, Jones left the United Kingdom on the way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s first priority.
It was a long - term investment that would provide her with economic security for the next decades.
Everyone is shocked that she has chosen to retire.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday — it was just before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters now ready for sale.”
Experts believe that this Morning program manager, among the most popular stars in Britain, may cost the company several million pounds because of large investment in products such as pillows and lights, motes and cosmetics, as well as a potential delay in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the last ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with the Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman of the board in March.
The two pairs go on vacation together, and Jones has 40% ownership in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is going to be M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin, hosting the I'm A Celebrity I'm.
A source close to Jones said yesterday "We don't want to comment on his business affairs."
"And then we fell in love."
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for having made a comment some would consider 'little presidential' and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
Trump said in his imitation of a newsanchor.
“I have not given away anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, after even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big shit on the way to nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea’s top diploma Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a “equivalent response” from the United States on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that instead, the United States continues to have penalties aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a gathering of his electorate.
"We do very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go to war against North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve Kim’s relationship have given positive results, such as stopping rockets, helping to get hostages released and getting the remains of U.S. officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this stappy arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said and pointed to the area right ahead.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia ravages an island and kills hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign ideal organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombox residents had lost their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for international assistance to be sent in.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not ask for international help, so it is quite challenging,” explained Sumbung.
Save the children now set up a team to travel to Palu, but still is not sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the National Crisis Management Agency, said that Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations are allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Taking into account the constant earthquakes of Indonesia, the country is terribly poorly prepared to deal with nature’s anger.
The shelter to protect from tsunami is built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, although a warning had been issued, has likely contributed to the death counts.
Even under the best circumstances, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia's fallen-finished infrastructure to a key point in his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and rail.
But money shortages have been a major problem for Joko's administration, which will be re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have switched to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows, bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge with late counterfeiting in battle with Chelse
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League loss against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting for 89 minutes at the Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea target while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before he sent it to the longest corner.
The test went high over the box as the ball fell to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball crossed a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq are always sending the ball forward as well as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and touched the ball once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked it."
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a target for 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a pass with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before he changed his direction near the middle track and swung into Liverpool's track half.
Kovacic came with a quick delivery on the middle track.
He then fired a great breakthrough fit that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner met a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Napoli in the group game of Champions League at 3:00 on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo, Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European football game for men in London at 3:00 a.m. on Thursday.
Death rates from the tsunami in Indonesia reach 832
The death rates of Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunami have risen to 832, announced the National Crisis Management Agency early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a strike of 7.5 that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, explaining the agency’s spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from ruined buildings.
The police arrest a man (32) for murder after a woman is stabbed to death.
A homicide investigation has started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street, a 32-year-old man is arrested, suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything about contacting.
Detective Brian O'Hagan says: “We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I want to ask everyone in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask all, especially taxi drivers, who may have picked up something on their car camera, to contact — they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the deceased woman was resident in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said they're working to inform the victim's relatives.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or out of the building.
He was deaf when he discovered what had happened.
The inhabitants are now told that it will take hours to return.
A police officer was overheard when he told a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up at the crime scene.
She repeats "It is so horrible" over and over again.
At 14 o'clock, two police cars were behind the lockdown, while a third car was standing right outside.
A number of police officers were standing outside the lockdown and supervised the apartment complex.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct notification to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, referring to "log 247" from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial that has been drawn into the dispute about "to rewrite history"
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatic puritanians.
But the Comwell Society's history has described Jeremy Crick's publisher as "noisy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster palace would also become a goal.
The idoloclasm of the English civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing production of Cromwell is evidence of the 1800s' opinions and is part of historic history for a man many people still feel deserve to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell becomes of many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, viewed as Parliament’s defender against pressure from outside – in his time it was of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His performance as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Killing pigs kills Chinese peasants.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on is the Southwest China market, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only with the surname “Yuan”, was found dead and covered by blood from a cracked artery near a binge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province, China.
Apparently, he had traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the gate of a nearby pig path was open.
He said inside the pork stain there was a big mistake with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a medical investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and maltacted” explained the cousin, mentioned with the surname Wu, in a quote for Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance camera recordings showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
While the police gathered evidence from the crime scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else.
Yuan's family and market management, apparently, are negotiating compensation for the death.
Even if it happens to the source, it is not the first time it is registered that a pig has attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts, causing serious damage to the man.
Ten years earlier, a Walesian farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 - kg pig until the farmer’s wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to the CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to common, but that the flavour of blood can have a triggering effect.
"They're just playing.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anyone.
You only have to show sufficient respect."
The rest of the hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in Southwest America.
As reported, the hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves across the cooler sea on the north coast of Mexico.
Still, Rosa will bring flood rain on her journey through North Mexico and Southwest America in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 at 05:00 ET on Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a train begins to form over the Pacific and move east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture north to the southwest United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction between tropical humidity and the path that approaches will lead to widespread, southwestern rain during the next days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous floods, floating shrubs and fast and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Deep-ropic humidity will result in rainfall rates of up to 5–7 cm per hour in some areas, especially southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5-10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern country, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for floods of rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the spreading tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert on foot as long as there is a danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can make elvedals widely pouring rivers, and thunder will lead to local winds that can contain dust and sand.
The path approaching will lead to local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along South Californien.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to floating shrub and fast, as well as smooth road paths.
This will be the first rainfall in the area.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning before the rain will spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and continue all Wednesday.
October may lead to intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic becomes colder but the tropics keep very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout Central America on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to rebuild and expand.
Large parts of Central and Eastern America are likely to get a warm start in October, with degrees high on the twenty-thirds from South Plains to parts of the North-East America.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday — this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term Climate Report indicates that eastern America is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six television networks, so Thursday's gripping testimony from Supreme Court Candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual abuse that is supposed to have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political coward continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to advertise Friday’s great surprise in the last second, when it came out that the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged for the FBI to carry out a weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate’s Court Committee that she is 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he was 100% certain that this did not happen.
The shipment on Friday was likely seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average seer numbers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seeer numbers were not immediately available for other networks showing the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems with measuring office viewers.
To give a little perspective, this seer number is equal to the end of the American football championship or Oscar.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose objectors have supported Kavanaugh’s appointment with great enthusiasm, led the head of the networks, with an average viewer of 5.69 million for the full - day hearing.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still great after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a meeting in the court committee while demonstrators shouted and shouted at him.
He stood with lowered eyes for several minutes while being mocked, while the event was sent directly to CNN.
"I am standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he tells our country the truth?"
He was told that “You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office had made a statement, and he said, as the elevator doors closed, that he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the consultations directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be continued to the whole Senate for Voting.
But Flake said that he was willing to do this only if the FBI examined the charges against the candidate by next week, which the democratic minority has encouraged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's choices had a great impact when it was clear that the Republicans had not enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened a FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, the British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused the opposers of her plan to leave the EU for "political gambling" with the future of Britain and undermine the interests of the nation.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom 29 September 2018.
In another interview, pressed side by side with her own on the front of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has continued her attack on her so-called "Chequers" plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect each other's tariffs was "whole ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: the police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected to have caused the LSU player's death.
The police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) has been arrested and charged for deliberate murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video tape of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the basketball.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS partner WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he confessed to have shot and killed Wayde.
His bail is set at $350.000, according to The Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish court doctor published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is indicated as a bullet wound in the head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for their team of refugees, the state police lab, the Southern University police and the local population for their contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU athlete Joe Alleva thanked the local police force for its “hard work and pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "known" and "in shock" after Waydes' death.
"This is what we fear at all times," said Wade.
Vulcan sprays ash over Mexico City
The ash spraying out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico’s public body for crisis prevention, warned the people of Mexico on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity rose in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within one day.
The agency monitored several cases of roasting and roasting.
Photos of social media showed a thin layer of ashes that covered the cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 shaken central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the Independence Vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after Protestants for Independence had a confrontation with the police, while thousands participated in competing demon stations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on liberation.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the rebel police and bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handmeng also broke out later that day, when the police used batons to limit the fights.
For hours, independent demonstrators stood and shouted "Never forget, never forgive", face to face with Unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension remains high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separate Catholics.
The vote was overwhelmingly overwhelming for breakdown, but it was a bad meeting because the vote was settled by most opposers of liberation.
According to Catholic authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote carried out at election stations throughout the region.
Liberation teams camped in the streets night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was suspended, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist prost with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalonia’s ability to become independent.
“ Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy, but now we're stuck, he told me.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catholic independence have had problems with keeping pressure up this year, as many of their prayers known leaders have traveled in self - imposed exile or are in custody while awaiting trial for their role in arranging the referendum and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict was stirred up by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming increasingly tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned for a trial since late last year, announced that he will be elected in the European Parliament next year.
"To be a candidate in the European elections is the best thing I can do to condemn the oppression and regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years of age are arrested after a car was repeatedly driven into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A armbrow may also have been fired against the car at some point.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 victory against Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
Revoked Livinston amazed Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's other losses after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt’s side is now similar to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won on the distance in Premier League this season and will play against the leaders Hearts, which are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will play home fight against Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has been unconquered through six fights in the division, and Chief Strips Holt has not yet lost a fight after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for his slow guests
Holt's team would have led long before they scored, when their direct approach caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kick on after sliding in to meet Craig Halkett head past the target.
The host allowed Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for their guests at deathball.
And that is how the decisive goal came to pass.
Rangers gave up a freespark and Livingston found an opening — Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a clear path, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
Within this stage, Rangers had had the ball almost all the time, but the defense of the home team had proved to be irreversible and target Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a almost score that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers warden Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston deathball in a wide short-sighted game.
Crossings came into the Livingston box and were constantly rescued, while two penalties – once after Halkett’s protest against Glenn Middleton's profit, and once by hand – were ignored.
‘Fenomenal’ from Livingston — Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and they continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The play style and crew have hardly changed since they got to the top again, but Holt is supposed to have much of the honor for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing and coordinated an enormously well-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toe heavily throughout the fight.
Rangers, on the other hand, had no inspiration from me.
Although at times they have been very good under Gerrard, they did not live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was labs — they only got into the home team’s halfway once — and it was quite a wake-up for Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets a mixed reception in Cologne.
Everything was just smile and blue sky on Saturday 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
There have been disputes about human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's involvement in the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police indicated security as the reason why a crowd of 25,000 people were not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many adherents came near to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also heard from them, criticized Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the division that follows a man who is praised as a hero of some German Turks and hated as an autokrat by others.
Deptford collision: bicycles killed in a car collision
A cyclist has been killed in a collision like with a passenger car in London.
The collision took place in the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford southeast of the city, about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the ground.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a road trip where the driver escaped from the crime scene in Childrens Street, about one kilometre from Saturday’s collision.
The Metropolitan Police said the police are working on identifying the man and informing the relatives.
Road barriers and bus traffic are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison, six cops injured in riots.
Six prison officers are injured in an incident at a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 p.m. on Sunday, and are still in progress.
Specialized "Tornado" officers are collected to deal with the incident, which involves eight prisoners and is limited to one flight.
The police were treated for minor face damage on the ground.
One prison official said: “Specially trained prison staff have been sent in to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six co-workers have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – the responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind locks and beats.”
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the rebel police were called to deal with a serious incident where the employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (can be favourable for drought areas)
It is the source of Arizona being hit by a tropical imagination, but it will probably happen early next week, as the remaining force of hurricane Rosa moves through southwestern desert areas and brings floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into south and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and the rain will start late Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclines have maintained the status of tropical storms or lurches within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border to Arizona.”
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5-10 cm of rainfall, with up to 15 cm in some places in Mongollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the center of the Rocky Mountains mountain chain and Great Basin, will likely reach between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of rain is possible in some areas.
For those outside the flood, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this precipitation is likely to be favourable since the South West America is currently in a dry state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the hurricane Pink land on the Mexican Peninsula Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum wind power of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific, thereby losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to meet Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday evening or afternoon.
The precipitation over parts of Mexico can be powerful and lead to great flooding.
‘Total rainfall of 7,5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with potential for up to 25 cm of rainfall’, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical lprint, which this moves on through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
“The head father expected by Rosa or the remainder of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States,” according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce deadly floods and floating shrubs in the desert and terrain in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack, four arrested for murder attempts.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of murder attempts, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 BST on Sunday.
He was taken to the hospital, and his condition is supposed to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have asked anyone who could have a mobile recording of the incident to contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has been "boring under the pettyness and mind" of the democratic party.
"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the democratic party," Trump said in front of a public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been "boring under the pettyness and mind" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of the Congress on Thursday, and denied the strong and emotional accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual abuse against her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford is also witnessed on his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw how brilliant, skilled and brave” Kavanaugh was that day.
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, with an unprecedented conduct in public service,” he told a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred discreetly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of the Republicans voting in the interdependence elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our life.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
"That's why I'm traveling around and fighting for the best candidates."
Trump claimed that the democrats aim to “resist and prevent”.
The first interdepartment of the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to what the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party has said to the CNN.
Hundreds of deaths of Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged to sea by huge waves thundering against the beaches when a great earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] high waves thundered in land around sunset, destroyed everything in their way, and drowned many.
The tsunami came into the heels of a strong earthquake of 7.5.
“When the tsunamifare occurred yesterday, people were still operating on the beach, did not escape immediately and ended up as victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Crisis Management Board (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami was not alone – it took cars, trees and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, and added that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed in trees to escape the tsunami and survived."
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the crisis management department showed many ruined buildings and shops, twisted and broken bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershake continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes range could be felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Institute for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated that the power of Friday’s huge earthquakes was about 200 times more than the power of the nuclear bomb released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bow may have made the tsunami larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as “inclusive” and said that thousands of dwellings, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and damages could be the larger coast of the country 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, nearer the heart of the earthquake.
The communication “was completely crippled, completely without information” from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 30,000 people living there,” said the Red Cross in a press release, and added that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had met Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is hearing desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passersby on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water rushes toward the beach and tears up buildings and cars.
Reuters have not been able to authenticate the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a major power break that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuators still desperately need food and other needs.
The city airport is only open for aid work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Death rates after the tsunami in Indonesia are rising over 800.
It's horrible.
World Vision's staff from Donggala have made it safe to Palu's center, where they have sought shelter under the presenning tent in front of their office, but they passed great destructions on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of broken houses," he said.
It's horrible.
As relief organizations began the depressing preparations to provide emergency aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with much expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until declared as a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'Okay, this is a national disaster', we can open the borders for international assistance, but the situation has not got any status yet."
As the sun goes down over Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquakes and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that brighten up the dark news after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday a woman was liberated by rescue crews after spending two days trapped under ruins with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the National Paragliding Team, had trained two of the missing paraglides of the Asian Games, which were carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional shoulder to carry," he said.
Gendon told me that in the hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the performers who participated in the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only resulted in grey marks, rather than a couple of blue marks.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal USD 26 750 under minibank filling in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26.750 from a Brink's worker who filled a minibank in Newport on the Leveee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who "run up behind the Brink's staff" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses then more suspects escaped from the crime scene, according to the press report, but the police have not specified the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information on their identity needs to contact the Newport police of 859-292-3680.
The rapper changes his name to Ye.
The Rapper Kanye West changes his name - to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The cut previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has had the nickname Ye over a long time, using the name as the title of his eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the program after she canceled on "emotional basis", according to the serial maker.
In addition to being a shortening of his present professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye – like a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more than a representation of who we are."
He's one of many known rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, previously cooperating with West, has also varied between the use of dash and upper letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians.
Mexico's Attending President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he will never use military power against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that “he will never ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
Military troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, and killed as many as 300 people, during a period when left-country student movements rooted across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education lead young people into criminal gangs.
US should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and performer of artificial intelligence, which has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements on artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States in general does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its side, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in the innovation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double financial support can double the chance of the next major performance in artificial intelligence coming from the United States,” Lee explained in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that beat the US's best Othello player, and later was a leader of Microsoft Research or Director of Google's Chinese Department.
Lee recognized the American government's former technological competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held to help find the next generation's wise heads.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government appropriations.
"It's not China who steals the academic leaders, it's the companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired smart heads from the universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those who have an artificial intelligence doctoral degree should receive the offer of residence permit automatically,” he said.
China State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation finances people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative named AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are investing more than USD 100 million in research into artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. Law Agency, which aims to set up a National Safety Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has been suspended for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the name of the country to the “Northern Macedonia” in order to resolve a decades of dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become members of the EU and NATO.
Greece, also with a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in Greek territory and has set down veto against including them in NATO and the European Union.
The two governments made an agreement in June based on the proposed new nav, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gerge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a bocottting campaign has raised doubts about the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the voting note is: ‘Are you for NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece.’
Those who support the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be eligible for membership of organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU's protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it will probably be crucial because a high enough number of MEPs have said that they will comply with the result of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-third majority in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission has stated that they had not received any irregularity reports by 13 p.m.
However, the meeting was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The People's Vote in Macedonia is about changing the name of the country to open the doors to become members of NATO and the EU.
Before the House in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) made clear a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those to bocotta the vote.
“We are positive to NATO and the EU, but we want to be reported with raised head, not let go back,” says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we are worthy of it.
If they refuse to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries such as China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead very much needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think most people will be for it because more than 80 of our citizens want us to become members of the EU and NATO,” says Zaev after voting.
He says a "yes" answer will be a "confirm of our future."
According to a survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum — this is lower than the required meeting.
Another study carried out by Makedonias Telma TV showed that 57 percent of the responders are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the meeting must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle that the Pro-West Government has encountered since it took over last May.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero maneuvers the entire Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling destroyed the Brighton Army in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculous when he scored a goal for 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He ran a race with three Brighton defenders before he got on the open.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a passport to the left, reaching Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right shoes to beat Brighton’s keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems,” said City Manager Pep Guardiola to the press.
“We talked about that he was going to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League game.
This target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he brought Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the death line.
City plays against Hoffenheim in Champions League at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be a spoiler for Rockies.
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet strong.
The always equally competitive Scherzer still hopes to be on the field on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff opportunities of the Colorado team, which leads over Los Angeles Dodgers with one fight in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card slot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals Friday night, but still looking to secure their first division title.
Even if we don't have anything to win, at least we can play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the most likely level of battle I get to play this year.
Why should I not take part in it?"
The Nationals have still not advertised their starting pitcher for Sunday, but should apparently be inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who, in this case, is starting pitcher for 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 games and lost 7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump Public Assembly in West Virginia
The president referred discreetly to the situation around Supreme Court Nomination Brett Kavanaugh while talking about how important it is that the Republicans vote in the interdependence elections.
"All that we have done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant, and that's why I'm traveling around and fighting for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued “You see this cruel, cruel group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power at all costs.
They don't care who they hurt, who they must overrun to gain power and control. That is what they want, power and control. We shall not give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have the goal of "resisting and preventing".
He said, "You will see it in the last four days," and called the Democrats "divine and evil and disrespectful."
He referred to the Senate Court Committee and mentioned the democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, where the audience bowed loudly.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I expect one — it was very bad body language — the worst body language I have ever seen. ”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They Don't tolerate people who say their opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to incite me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a long series of Labour MEPs who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of antisemitism.
In my case, I had to be censured because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, about Europe – ironically, similar matters that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders on.
On Friday, the Nottingham East Labour meeting said that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been just this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood at many of the meetings, and the promise of "much more friendly" policy is long forgotten if it started at all.
It becomes increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the working party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to the party management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously thought that I shared many political attitudes suddenly began to expect me to take an U-sving and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, desiring national security or the EU internal market.
When I speak publicly — and it doesn’t matter what I say — I receive a lot of ugly messages on social media that require my deliberation, condemn center politics, and tell me that I should not be in Labour.
And I'm not the only one who's been through this.
I know I'm happier with some of my colleagues because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that sexually discrimination and racist comments every day, but never allow themselves to be cowed.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross exclamation has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the working party should promote a tolerance culture.
The truth is, we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every distrust proposal and every change in the rules of elections will be narrower.
I have received many advice in the last two years when I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will “make everything better. ”
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the lack of thatcher government that had led to my classroom at the public school being literally fallen down, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councilman and minister of government.
I've never hidden my political opinions, not even in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the motion for a representative on Friday, I would just like to say that since the country is racing our way towards a Brexit that will harm private individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of deliberation or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I think best cares for your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeseired Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the end result a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this amazing entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
They are now at the top of the table, and are the only unconquered of the ten.
Finally, their superior defense was as much as their ability to use the opportunities that led to the loss of the homework, and Coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be happy.
“We have been challenged in our struggles so far and are still unconquered, so I have to be content with that,” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All honour to Ayr, they were better to use the opportunities than we were."
Grant Anderson's attempt for 14 minutes, with a target park from Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotland Captain Rory Hughes, borrowed from Warriors, allowed Melrose to smooth the position, and Jason Baggot performed an attempt without targets.
Climo strengthened Ayr's management with a penalty kick before he, just before he paused, scored and targeted a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 on a break.
But Melrose started the second half strong, and Patrick Anderson's attempts, with target kick from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on bars, and from the reboot Ayr increased the management's oath even more an attempt by Stafford McDowell, with the target kick from Climo.
Ayr’s operating captain, Blain Macpherson, then got yellow card, and Melrose exploited having an extra man on the field to the full with an attempt from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for handling Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson accomplished a touchdown by throwing in behind the moving Ayr maul.
Climo accomplished a target park, as he did again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the Still Game star Ford Kieran is on its way into the service industry — it was recently discovered that he was named as director of a restaurant company with grants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program for which he writes scripts and plays along with his long-term comedie partner, Greg Hemphil.
The dove has announced that the coming nineth season will be the last series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the case, but a source from The Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's "living restaurant business".
"The sea is ours: Bolivia, a country without a coastline, hope the court will open the way to the Pacific
Seamen patrol a riggins covered Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from the Titicacas Lake to the Amazonas are decorated with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The whole inland state of Bolivia has still freshened in memory the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s, and the country longs for once again to sail in the Pacific.
These hopes may be greater than they have been in decades, awaiting a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has a driving force, a community spirit and a calm mind, and of course awaits the outcome with a positive attitude”, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the judgment of the International Court on a large screen in many different parts of the country, hoping that the Hague Court will give its judgment in favour of Bolivia’s claim that Chile – after several decades of sporadic negotiations – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own expiration to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also put a great deal on Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to a return to the Pacific,” he promised late in August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will hardly take Bolivia’s side and that very little would change if it had.
The UN body, which belongs to the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean rural areas and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the judgment of the International Court comes only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case “is not complicated”, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia’s case, the last four years may actually have made things worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
She believes that Morales' antagonist rhetoric has wiped away any remaining kindness on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative at the Hague, rejected the theory that the court’s decision came unusually quickly.
According to him, Monday will give Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile” and the possibility to “stop 139 years of disagreement, in favour of both parties”.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – has used the maritime situation as a political shelf.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The knowledge is an opportunity to see what we must do to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never destroy its nuclear weapons if they can't trust American authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to observe their promises during a meeting between the two conflicting countries of Singapore.
These comments are coming at the same time as the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be ready to start the locked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "want dream" that continued sanctions and American opposition are declarations that end Korean war will ever force North Korea to knees.
American authorities are skeptical to accept the declaration without Pyongyang first initiating significant disarmament measures.
Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have another meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really intends to let go of an arsenal country is likely to see as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo's planning on visiting Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Mood shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge head plaques, heading towards a clothing store near you.
If you want some big additions to the hat collection or you want to hide completely from the sun, you don’t need to search anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne uncovered a selection of strange, overdimensionated head plaques as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motel doughnuts at Moteuka in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular at Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their striking creations down the catwalk.
Valentino’s most spectacular garment was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a featherlike broad breeze that drowned the heads of the models.
Other overdimensional accessories included jewelry watermelons, a wizard hat, or even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also uncovered a selection of bizarre masks – just in time to Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had reproduced lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation reminded me of diving equipment, including snorkels and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in a cookie.
And if you're looking for even bigger fashion accessories, you're lucky.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be headed for a clothing store near you.
The over-dimensionated hats come right in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a half-metre wide brake that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent another great creation down the catwalk — a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the bathing suit model that wears it.
The orange refife box, which is edged with refineries and complete with a white skin handle, was the most striking creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collision at Moteuka in Paris.
Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – when the designer has had such an impact, it will be difficult to overlook the demand for overdimensionated accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are crucial to world citizens
Scotland's fresh oils continue to show academic prominence, and this has remained in 2018 with more than one year of excellent exam results, supported by individual and common success in sport, art, music and other social measures.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland and work hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their position as world citizens.
As an educational body capable of designing and implementing a tailored school class, we see that modern languages are still a popular and demanded choosing field in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, his words reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, his words will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and confidence with people from other countries.
From the exam results of this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest percentages of stock from fresh oils.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the grade A.
The data collected from the 74 schools of the free school council showed that 72 percent of students received the grade A in mandarin, while 72 percent of German students also received A.
This illustrates that fresh oils in Scotland support foreign language as a decisive skill for children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as professional elections are now appreciated at the same level as real science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the school for fresh oils and other places.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for the reasons which employers reported to have problems occupying a vacant position, 17 per cent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important to clarify young people for a future career.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalised world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive preference.
According to a YouGov study answered by more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two - digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investment in language training is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those associated with emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages that are considered most valuable for Britain on the road towards 2020, such as mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose from in fresh oils, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scotish fresh oils aim to create a learning environment that will prepare and equip their children with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered ‘international communication’.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity, and award for Scotland’s young people.
Il faut the bee le faire.

LeBron is supposed to have his Lakers Debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting time is almost over with fans who want to watch LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opening fight against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's going to play is still not decided.
“There will be more than one and less than 48”, said Walton on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-play pre-song plan.
"I don't need seasonal games in this stage of my career," he replied.
Time of Trump's public meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President starts a series of election meetings tonight Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five planned public meetings in the next week, including stops in cities where he has much support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmatory vote of his elected Supreme Court Candidate has been put on hold, Trump has the goal of obtaining support for the forthcoming interdependence elections, since the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the electorates go to the elections in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia meeting tonight, and how can we see it online?
Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, west Virginia is to start at 7:00 a.m. tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's public meeting in West Virginia on the net below via direct flowing on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the week's hearings for Supreme Court-nomineed Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, and a anticipated confirmatory vote has been suspended for up to one week while the FBI is investigating the case.
The main objective of all these public meetings is to support republicians who face a challenging election in November.
Therefore, President Trump has said that these five public meetings in the next few weeks have the objective of “inciting volunteers and supporters, trying to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we move towards a busy campaign season”, Reuters heard from a campaign speaker for Trump who did not want to be named.
The evening's public meeting, which is planned at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania," and is covered by the Pittsburgh press, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month of Trump's visit to West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate Candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to lift him up on the polls,” said Simon Haeder, an expert in political science at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows battle spirit to keep faith as they enter Sunday single games
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The motion pendulum’s swinging pendulum is a fully invented idea of sport, yet something the players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
“They led with six points and now there are four, so we probably carry it with us as a little momentum,” said Jordan Spieth when he left the track for the day.
Of course, Europe wants the advantage – they lead with four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel that they've had a little wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tee to green, and leads by example.
As his round continued, the deep cry of celebration became higher and sank to a decisive set in order to raise the match to a draw when he and Thomas were two below after two.
His set, who won them the 15 match, was faced with a similar scream — by the sort that shows that he still doesn’t think the American team is out of chance.
“We really just have to put all the cloths on and focus on our own match,” said Spieth.
That's all this player has now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly Ryder Cup's great success story.
Europe’s unusual but glorious couples have four out of four and do not make a foot mistake.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who escaped a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the morning of the bookeys Saturday, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are the largest competitors of Sunday, and there are no other players the audience would rather see a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Especially both at the same time, in each one's hole.
It is still too early to declare Europe to be the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily hammered up with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was partner with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles during the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede were so far behind that they did not have the chance of reappearing.
But on Sunday there's no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look closely at because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and lies far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the battle spirit some, especially in the United States, have missed.
Europe leads 10-6 at the beginning of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong precedent at the start of Ryder Cups last day, after h completion of Sunday's four-ball and foursomes matches with 10-6 leadership towards the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the lead with two victories against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised their score for Le Golf National so far as four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European page, who struggles to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's miserable side in the four-balls of the morning and won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they didn't get any of the pre-pictures.
Jim Furyk's side has to pick up eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to get four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who have been called Molinari after a sensational weekend – are the only couple who have received four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they collaborated seamlessly to beat down broken Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who halted through two games on Saturday, flashed at times but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and accomplished a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked as number one and three worldwide.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this warm day with light bris southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-fighted 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, a team has managed to get in after a four-point prep at the start of the single game, but as current holders only need Furyk's side to achieve a draw in order to keep the trophy.
But after being the second best for two days, they do not seem to be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will 'no way' agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations that continued sanctions strengthened the distrust against the United States and that the country will in no way agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea has implemented “significant charity measures” in the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"We have never seen any equivalent response from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will under no circumstances unilaterally disarmament ourselves first.”
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints against Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual downrooting steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against the 'Atom Disarmament of the Korean Peninsula', while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has called for a formal conclusion of the Korean war, which lasted from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce severe international sanctions against North Korea.
‘The United States insists on ‘atom disarmament first’ and raises the pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective by force, and even opposing ‘the declaration of the end of the war’, according to Ri.
"The belief that sanctions can force us to our knees is a dream for people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of the penalties creates further distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for a second match between Kim and Trump, which the American leader stressed before the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: “If the other party to this disarmament case was South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have been as locked as it is.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the United States of America with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Ond President" Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
After threatening “full destruction” by North Korea last year, Trump stood this year before the UN and commended Kim for being courageous enough to take the disarmament steps, but said that much work remains, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is nuclearly depleted.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a timeframe for this, and said that “it does not matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The sanctions of the Security Council must still be vigorously enforced and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament. ”
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to strap the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that they had made progress, but only hours after charged North Korea with "good demands".
North Korea committed at a meeting with Moon this month to deploy a missile area and a nuclear plant if the United States made “equivalent measures”.
He said Kim had said that these “equivalent measures” he wants were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalise the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard are taking a course of rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students to get more sleep by coping with the growing incubation by pouring through the night with caffeine peninsulas as fuel.
One academic found that students at the world’s best university often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, prepared the course, which he considers to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He started his course after giving a talk about the effect of sleep shortages on learning.
"After the talk, a girl came to me and said, "Why hasn't anyone said this before?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains the importance of good sleeping habits in order to perform academic and sportsly, and to the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for university health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw the students suffer from severe sleep shortages.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a room in a bedroom, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep shortages and how important a sleep routine is.
In another part, the participants learn how long - term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons makes the participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to pour all night, he said, and he added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students led to an increasing problem of sleep.
Enough and good sleep should be the student’s “secret weapons” against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as sleep shortages put the brain in a hunger state, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, taking one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course available to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master students to take a similar study program before they are enrolled at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students set on an alarm for when to lie down as well as for when to get up and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic monitors and LED lights. This type of light can interfere with the day's rhythm and lead to difficulty sleeping.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Target of Menga strikes Gerrard's men
Rangers had another loss when Dolly Menga's target hit Steven Gerrard's team 1 to 0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox page wanted to get its first victory since February's victory 4-1 on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's other losses on 18 games as manager and left his eight points from Ladbroke's Premiership Leaders Hearts.
Menga hit to seven minutes before the break, and Rangers never managed to counterbalance.
Rangers now fall to the sixth place, while Livingston climbs to the third and is behind Hibernian on target.
There may be more trouble in the yard for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown out of the abolition.
Gerrard made eight shifts on the team, swept past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup Seminals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Heart’s last week, and he would have been pleased with how his well - trained team beat the opponents.
Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should've scored only two minutes into the game when Menga's first passing sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's target, but the middle player played aside the chance.
A long freespark of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the target bar.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that their game was more on hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he was supposed to have a penalty kick after 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers only got two shots on target at first, but former Ibrox target Liam Kelly didn't get any problems with Lassana Coulibalys head and a tamed kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While the opening of Livis for 34 minutes may have been against the game's course, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Once again, Rangers couldn't handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player exchange gave immediate results when the wing player sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play just the kind of game they like, as Lithgow and Halkett captured long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacob's before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers' influx Glenn Middleton might have had a late demand for a crime park when he got into conflict with Jacobs, but again saw Thomson away.
Almanac: The inventor of the geiger
And now a page from the Sunny Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we know today as the geiger.
The geigerteller has been an important part of science since then, and became also part of popular culture through the 1950 Bells of Coronado film, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man, "What is it?"
Rogers: “It is a geigerteller; it finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity of the minerals release.’
Evans, "Surely there is a sound now."
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention for which he gave names lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them into a laboratory
Cells can now ‘see’ a protein that is common in many cancers and then be injected in the patient again.
A vaccine during testing has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced the ovarian cancer she suffered from for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein called HER2, typical of many cancers, and then these cells are injected in the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine. ”
HER2 “driver growth of different types of cancer”, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and ‘trained’ to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came with great defense of Trump after the SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was bowed in a studio on Saturday Night Live after a fabulous performance where he praised the American president Donald Trump and said he wanted to make elections in 2020.
After presenting his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again Hat, he langed out against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“It happens so often that I speak to a white person, and then he says: ‘How can you like Trump, he is a racist?’
If I were afraid of racism, I would have moved from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee on the charges of sexual abuse presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West was uploaded into social media by Comicator Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by putting out the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he heard it in the back room about the choice of head plagues.
“They mocked me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat."
They mocked me!
And then they said I don't understand what reality is," he said, Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see that I understand what the reality is?” he said that he would “take on me the Superman robe, because then no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love."
His comments were bowed at least twice, and the employees who worked at SNL looked embarrassed, reported Variety, where a staff member said: “The whole studio became deadly.”
West was brought in as the last little replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he presented the song “I Love It” dressed like a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our braveest: TAKE TO YOU GET THE IMOT MASSES. ”
But the speaker Karen Hunter twitted that West is just “who he is and it is absolutely amazing.”
"But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ' art') which I believe cultivates and spoils out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on, he was “the being formally known as Kanye West. ”
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow now in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper colleague Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion, and then, of course, it's the late musical alloy Prince who changed the name of a symbol and then the artist who was once known as Prince.

The game of Thrones star Kit Harington deals against "good masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of sword swinger Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31 - year - old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles on films often make young men think they must be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones Colleague Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he was very concerned about the theme.
“It concerns me quite much these days — where did it go wrong with the masculinity? ” he said.
"How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?"
Kit believes TV may be part of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the strong masculine roles.
He said, "What is inborn and what is instructed?
What is being communicated on TV and on the streets? What makes young boys feel that they must grow just this side by being a man?
I think it is one of the really big questions today — how can we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admits that he will not make any predecessor or successor of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he is “finished with battlefields and horses”.
From November Kit will play the main part of a new recording of Sam Shepard True West, this is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, ” he said, “that is how something good came out of it — my future family and my life from now on. ”
Rose played Ygritte, which Kit's character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy prize-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family property in Scotland.
Hiv/aids: China reports 14 % increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, says a health representative.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China by contagious blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way is now closer to zero, said Chinese health professional at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 10,000 people a year.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT individuals is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men having sex with men eventually marry women.
A lot of the disease is due to insufficient protection from sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised public access to HIV medicine as part of a measure to address the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the fact that co-worker leaked data on Republican Senators, fnyss of "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of the Representant's house, Maxine Waters, rejected Saturday's charges that members of her staff had posted the personal data to three Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles assured of the allegations was made by “ultraconservative” commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more reprehensible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the attack charges against Supreme Court Candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, like Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address of the source behind the article was tracked to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of the Waters staff, according to Hill.
"This unjustified accusation is completely incorrect and a regular lie," continued Waters.
“The members of my staff, who have received their identity, personal data and security compromised by these unfair and false accusations, had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unjustified accusation is completely wrong and a regular lie.'
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is aggressive," wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temper to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he must not be aggressive.
They can't go to defense.
Don't question the motives of the prosecutor.
They must act calmly.
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing aggressively during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate working to remove Waters in the intermediate elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
"Big - if it's true," he twitted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified “relevant authorities and police of these false accusations”.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held responsible for all destructive and dangerous acts for each of my staff.”
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again – bloodfattig Rowan Atkinson in spy parodi
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit performances in all new films with a British slope and it seems to be current for this resuscitation of the parodifranchise Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurrected in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satisfaction about how clearly hopeless we are to become the nation’s new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his glowing eyes and the rubber face has renewed its license to mess it up for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure intended for territories with non-English speaking quinopublissum.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a deck of Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with one note in the musical intake of the fire chariot theme during the opening ceremony of the Olympics in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the long-lost TV ads of Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's one and another great moment in the last Johnny English tour.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor leaves sneaked his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to its right, but the humor feels quite bloodless and strangely unnecessary, especially now that the “serious” brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible willingly away have the features of comedy.
The humour seems to be more directed towards children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's fats are not as inventive and spicy as the silent film eyes of Mr Bean.
The current premise is that Britain is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super secret web network of spys and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the guardian agent – a sad little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for a Prime Minister, a pompous and devastated figure that is already undergoing a complete crisis of political unopularity: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this kind of Teresa-May role, but the script doesn't give her much to work on.
Her intelligence advisers tell us that since every active spy has been exposed, she has to bring in someone among the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works teaching at a snobbed establishment, but gives unofficial teaching in secret intelligence, there are some funny sequences here, when English offers a rocka Academy for spying.
English is being snapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, troubled helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, mutilated with a submarine commander, a hysterical superclass lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin style of messing everything up on mission for the queen is back, where they face Olga Kurylenko amazing five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is seduced by the karismatic technology millionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the lazy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the journey with pears-like side-ups: disguised as waiters they set fire to a hot French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so sweet and noisy it's so much like child TV with the whole thing.
Pretty moderate, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think, can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies that they're preparing plans to let the British work for four days but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will give the British four-day week work – but get paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business managers to use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra weekly day off.
This will result in a three - day weekend for employees while receiving the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to a four-day week so that workers can also benefit from the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to allow the pendulum to turn to the workers’ advantage – in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. The Green Party promised four-day week during the campaign before the parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the idea is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesman for Labour said: "A four-day week is not the party's policy, and is not something that is considered by the party."
Financial policy spokesman for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "faceless directors" and "profit" of public service providers.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are in danger of not getting back the whole share item because a Labour government can make a deduction from perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the company managers and set up staff funds to transfer 10 % of the equity to private sector companies to the employees, which can receive an annual yield of 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their minds.
The FBI review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of the Agency's findings may cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked in "60 Minutes" the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the accusations came out and said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, swift, unequivocal."
However, Graham’s voice seems to have been cut into stone.
“I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it would have to be a remarkable finding,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it energetic," Graham added and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of them she mentioned could confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything new will change it."
What is Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to combating poverty?
This Saturday is New York host of Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and equally impressive missions; exterminate the world’s poverty.
Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will cause thousands to flow to the great lawn of Central Park, not only to experience sizes such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase consciousness about the real goal of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by making more people work actively against poverty.
In order to obtain a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or "actions", such as voluntary work, send e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or in other meaningful ways to increase awareness about their goals of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there is only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to make people fight for changes, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - that people feel they contribute greatly by signing a signature campaign online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have recorded more than 19 million ‘actions’ from supporters, with a variety of objectives.
They say that these actions have contributed to making world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 commitments and announcements due to their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The Group estimates that the guaranteed funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and farmers based in the United Kingdom to “help children to exploit their full potential” and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 tweetes from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice with malnutrition a footnote in history,” told the Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in Britain to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional measures.
In answer to one of the common questions on the website, "What makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied: "It will be a long and difficult way – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-aparteid movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, are some of the artists performing this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Navy as a ‘block’ to prevent Russian energy exports - the Minister of Interior
Washington may ‘if necessary’ go to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including in the Middle East, revealing the U.S. Minister of Interior, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s engagement in Syria — especially when operating at the invitation of the legal government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flag of Europe,” he should have said.
And according to the official, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States through the Navy has the opportunity to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, blockers to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization profiled as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of interacting with Russia and Iran and noted that they are far on their way.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,” he said and referred to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the most expensive alternative for European consumers.
As a result, employees of the Trump Administration, including the President himself, tried to persuade Germany to depart from the “inappropriate” project The North European Gas Guide 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which is going to double the existing gas pipe capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kreml argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier,” said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with the US Minister for Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has faced opposition from Germany, which has once again confirmed its commitments to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have serious problems with third countries intervening in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the leader of BDI after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to think seriously about his presidential candidate for 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts.
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "think seriously" if she wanted to be presidential candidate after the inter- elections.
During a electorate meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she wanted to stand down.
“It is time for women to get to Washington and fix the broken government, including a woman on top,” says The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'd like to think seriously about whether I'm going to make a presidential candidate."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the electorate meeting and said that he "took the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried all the way into the margin about what Donald Trump does to democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court Candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need a FBI review before voting."
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think that she should be postponed in 2020.
58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the Senator should not stand down, according to a opinion poll from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidateship.
The opinion survey showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidateship and 48% were against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with a possible candidateship in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin points up Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after hiring in Sept.
He was arrested and charged for a home violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after coming home, I have in common with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability of our soldiers,” she told the audience at a election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in space" and said about the son and other veterans of war: "They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home and they wonder if this is the respect for what their soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with violence in the home of a woman, clustering with a report on home violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla police.
18 Länder and D.C. support the testing of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support a legal trial of a new policy in the United States which refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang or home violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and D.C. presented a briefing from the Amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, reported NBC News.
The entire name of the lawyer in Grace v. The session case that the American Civil Liberties Union set up in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner “and his violent gang members” abused her, but officials in the United States rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations who have major problems with gangs and home violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the appeal court of immigrants who gave undocumented immigrants who fled from home violence permission to apply for asylum.
Advocate General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy “is disregarding many decades of state, federal and international law”.
‘The federal law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle’, said the amicus curiae information.
The lawyers further argued in the information that policy that refused immigrants access harms the US economy and says that there is a great probability that they will grow up and help with the necessary labour force."
Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims who flee home violence and gang violence in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who leave the homeland due to persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view,’ said the Sessions in the statement of 11 June on policy.
Asyl was never meant to reduce all problems – even all serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate Rescue Action in Palu — Doubts in Survival Search
For the survivors, the situation became worse and worse.
“It was very excited,” says 35 - year - old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her feverish son at a evacuation center in the closest town of Palu.
"All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
Clean water is deficiency’.
You could see residents who came to ruined homes and searched through water - damaged possessions in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals injured in the earthquake with strength 7.5 were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke their backs and shoulder, sit outside Palu’s military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because of ongoing severe aftershakes.
He gets tears in his eyes when he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shaked the hotel room in the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves safely.
I was hugged by the wall that collapsed, I think,” told Haris to the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to participate in a wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accused China of ‘trafficking’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after a public Chinese newspaper was driving a four - page ad in an American newspaper that beautifully painted the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China Peking accused the American press to spread propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the China Daily annex paid to break into Des Moines Register – the most selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China to try to interfere with the American Congress elections on November 6, a charge China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to influence the elections in the United States marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, according to Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign authorities to use advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has resulted in rounds of new tariff rates on each other’s import goods.
China’s penalties early in the trade war were to hit export holdings in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, reports Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador in China and formerly many - year governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has hit American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reading post in the Sunday Des Moines Register: "China is now stepping up the harassment by driving propaganda ads in our own free press."
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities exploit the freedom of expression and the open press that we enjoy in America to insert a paid ad in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“As a contrast – by the newspapers on the street here in Beijing, you will not find many deviating opinions and will not experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese people around the problematic economic course of China, given that the media are under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: "One of China's largest newspapers refused to publish his article, although he did not disclose what newspaper it was.
Republicans scare off female electorate before the inter-election with the Kavanaugh father, warn analysts.
Since many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend Supreme Court Candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual abuse targeted, analysts warn that they will have a counter reaction, especially from women, in the coming local elections.
The emotions around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to proceed with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said that these things cannot be withdrawn to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for a FBI review in the last second will be enough to relieve angry voters.
“Women will not forget yesterday’s events – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November”, said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
Friday morning, demonstrators sang “November is coming!” while demonstrating in the hallways of the Senate when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee chose to go on with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analytic, to the news page.
"People say it has already been high, it is true.
But it could be higher, especially among female insecure voters in the suburbs and younger choose between 18 and 29 years, who often do not vote even if they dislike the president.'
Even before Ford’s public witness giving a detailed description of the charges of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court Candidate, analysts felt that it would be a counterreaction if the Republicans forced through the appointment.
“This has become a happy root for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), in early last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not only about the Committee’s vote or the final approval or whether Kavanaugh is being introduced – it is also about the way the Republicans have dealt with this and how they have treated her”, said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group promoting the election of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided over who they should believe in the cold water of Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41% of the questions were entirely or quite convinced of Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were entirely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh's production.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or entirely convinced that Kavanaugh was lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After the record from Flake, the FBI is investigating the claims made by Ford in addition to at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh, in drunken condition, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court Candidate exposed her genitals to her while they were at a party during the study at Yale in the 1980s.
The author of World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology doctor's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where to store their data and which persons have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
"It is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own “personal data storage online” or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, working lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data storage online is that it is up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it “Personal Authorisation through Data”.
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to everyone.
At the moment, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some rented developers on contract to work with the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can establish their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about introducing something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely recalculated overnight.
We do not ask for your permission.
In an article on the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee stated that Inrupt’s “ mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important vote in the debate on online neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next epoch to the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Celebrating Victoria Cross Recipient from World War I
The only priest in the Church of England who was assigned a Victoria Cors during World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann were awarded the honour of September 29, 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never found out that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a "good symbolic" in that the stone was to be revealed exactly 100 years after the grandfather's prize winning success.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns”.
Later, he crashed towards the fireline and led the line “with great courage” forward before he stormed a field cannon independently and knocked out three of the departments.
Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the grandfather’s actions were “what I knew I could never live up to but something that makes me humble. ”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, led by the Corps of Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said “he felt very honored to play a role in the parade”, adding:“The tapperness of a real hero is demonstrated by the support of many people.”
MMA fans were up all night to see the Battle Sports Program Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pig.
Imagine that you've stayed awake all night to see the tightly packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you're not going to see the main fight.
The San Jose participant survived 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was shown directly through the night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the viewers in Britain were seated to numb when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to watch the battle.
A supporter described on Twitter the transition to the child program as “a kind of sick joke”.
"It is a state regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programs at 6:00 p.m. so they had to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communication when asked for the transmission.
"Peppa pig, yes!"
Bellator's Executive Director, Scott Coker, said they're going to work on the broadcasting plan to include the viewers in Great Britain in the future.
"I think we can figure it out for the rematch," said Coker.
"But it is six in the morning on Sunday there, and we will not be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe with -- when we put over, many messages went forward and back, and they were not exactly of the kind sort.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't that, it was a government thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five matches — which we usually send — and we tried to stretch far to the adherents, but we tipped over.
It's an unfortunate situation.'
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
The Olympic Jump Tom Daley said he grew up with an inferiority toward everyone because of his sexuality — but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it wasn't until at high school he realized that "he wasn't like others."
In the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he stood up for the rights of the homosexuals to give hopes to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The usual program manager of the traditional program, Kirsty Young, shall be gone for a few months due to disease.
Daley was a little lost on the Laver's first transmission and said he felt “less worth” than anyone else he grew up with because “it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls.”
He said, "To this day, it is these feelings of being inferior and different that have been the real motivation and have me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he “was something, ” he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is twice a bronze winner in the Olympics and has become a highly profiled LGBT ambassador, using his participation in this year's Samveldelker in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands up because he feels lucky that can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others “hopes. ”
The three-time world champion said that his inauguration of a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013, “abazed me. ”
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age,” he took part in his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar up and downtures.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "the whole perspective" his had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about the fact that I had to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are greater things than the golden medal in the Olympics.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years after diagnosing brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was if they had obtained tickets to London in 2012 — since he wanted to sit on the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the first row,” he said.
“I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the Olympic Republic of 2012 and won bronze.
“I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to bounce in front of a homepublic under the Olympic, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud of Heather Small, which meant much to him in the drive-in before the Olympics and still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs goes to BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Formswake Mickelson taken out to the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for impressive 12th time, was placed on the bench by Lieutenant Jim Furyk before Saturday's four-ball and four-some games.
Instead of being in the center of the events, as he had so often been for the United States, the five times the major winner shares the day between being a cheerleader and working with his game on the rank in hopes of correcting what scratches.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of the career and is not in the perfect form of the tight Le Golf National Train, where the long rough area is constantly punishing lost battles.
And if the track is not in itself scary enough, Mickelson will meet in the 9th fight on Sunday, even the British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their fights this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson’s game may prove to be crucial.
Fury expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could have said anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a clapp on my back, and put his arm around me, and said he would be ready the next day," said Furyk.
He has great confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to these layers before, and this week.
I guess I didn't see him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fallo's record for most played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Fury said his participation brought some intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, and likes to make fun of others. He's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives much more than just the game."
European Team Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant leadership at the entrance to the last day’s single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 battle at Valderrama, where one page led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but curved the victory with the least possible margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far”, said Bjørn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 wins 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leads 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on that team that this isn't over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bear is very pleased with how his players have been doing on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t do better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances in the center, and it's something else.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performance as a golf player is tested to the full.
It is the message that you must convey to the players that they must get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bear, opponent Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the major revolutions the last day. He was on the winner team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed the “miracle of Medinah”.
I remember every damn word of it,” he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had ravaged his players at the entrance to the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to have a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum begins to go in one direction, it puts great pressure on the middle matches.
We arrange our setup then and send out the people in the way we feel. You know, we're trying to create something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight and challenging Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the play order.
“I'm betting on this group of men in that order because I think it's going all the way,” said Bear about his choices of single players.
Germany's new warships delayed once again
The German Navy's latest fregatt would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it will not happen until the beginning of next year due to defective systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the drivership of the brand new fregatts of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have been delivered to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered back in 2007 will replace the old fregates of the Bremen class.
They are agreed to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to use the latest fregatts for up to two years from home port.
Still delays mean, however, that the advanced warships — they were told to give Germany strength on the sea — will already be outdated before they are set in service, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125-fregate created headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the causes of return, but the German media mentioned a number of important "software and hardware defects" which made the warship useless in a battle mission.
The software defects were particularly important since ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew on older fregates in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has an enormous overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the marine’s prospects for upgrading in the future.
The 7000 tons heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price label for the entire project — including training of the crew — has also become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached EUR 3.1 billion — from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new fregates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s marine force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Government's Defence Committee, confirmed that the Navy actually "goes out of useable ships".
The official said that the problem has escalated over time because old ships were out of range, but no new ships arrived.
He's sorry that none of the fregatts in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
National Trust steals the secret life of the bats
New research carried out in a countryside in the Scottish Highland will reveal how bats use the landscape in the hunting for food.
There is hope that the findings will throw new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the development of future conservation measures.
The study of researchers at National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf flagermus as well as the brown lance and water flagermus at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track flagermus activity through the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flagermouses and which species do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be drawn up to produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Environmental Advisor, hopes that the results will identify the areas of the habitat that are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on measures to be taken, such as the establishment of pastures and the best care of the forest for bats and other associated species.
The flagermus population in Scotland and Britain has declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work affecting breeding sites and habitat restriction.
Windmills and lighting may also pose a risk, the same with fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials, as well as hut tax attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than for their eyes to catch prey.
They use advanced echo locations to find insects and obstacles on the road when flying.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of lands around the country, takes the bat very seriously.
They have ten skillful experts who regularly carry out studies, surveys of breeding sites, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization also established Scotland’s first and only own flagermus reserve at Threave countryside in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threave we have a perfect area for bats," he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other property will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underlines the importance of mapping the bats before maintaining a property, since unconscious destruction of one single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young people, perhaps destroying a whole local population.
Bats are protected, and killing them, harassing or disturbing them or destroying their breeding places is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish co-worker for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to help in the work.
She says: “We still have much to learn about our bats, and for many species, we simply don’t know how the populations survive. ”
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges while lawyers will sue German magazines.
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against him as "false news" and says that people "want fame" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He's accused of paying her $375,000 in front of her for keeping the incident close, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the charges as “false news. ”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, says five times the Goldball wins into the camera.
"They want fame by using my name.
It's normal.
They want fame by giving me my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," adds the football player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the allegations, which they have called ‘an unacceptable production of suspicions in the private sphere’, according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the football player will require compensation for “discriminatory damage to a degree corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is likely one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years”.
The alleged event is supposed to have taken place in June 2009 on a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are supposed to have returned to the football player's room, where he supposedly raped her analt, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was "99% a good man" who was betrayed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later they made conciliation outside the court because she was “feared of revenge” and was also concerned about being “publicly hanged”.
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to put the settlement aside because she's still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the supposed assault, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus to a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom “will grieve forever” over losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “will mourn forever” if they lose the world leader status in car production after Brexit, said Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “anxiety” that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, they would stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automobile manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border passing by a possible Brexit without agreement may mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
“If the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, experience that production at our factory stops,” said Marvin Cooke, the Executive Director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement as to how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they're gonna close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is what car manufacturers say is the supply chain risks of a possible Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated on the basis of ‘request as necessary’ and it arrives every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a stay at the border, which the industry says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day stock at the Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa Mays Brexit's further connection plan with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such checks at the border”.
“We need to have an agreement, and we want to have the best deal that will enable us, as I say, not only to enjoy success at the moment, but to grasp this opportunity,” he said on the BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The message, not only from Toyota but also other car manufacturers, is that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped, but warned that increased costs in the long term will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually result in job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: “My experience says that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Vice-President Rod Rosenstein may be “exposed another week” while the battle around Supreme Court Candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is in charge of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, relations between Trump assistants and Russia and possible obstacles to the presidency's trial.
The question about Trump will dismiss the Deputy Minister of Justice or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has for many months numbed up during the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of recording the talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Constitutional Plugin.
Rosenstein denied the information.
Last month, however, he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was retiring voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York City, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said "will preferably let go" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was exposed to avoiding the conflict with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of the witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI review on the charges against Kavanaugh, which further postponed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, took part in Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I realized it could be a week of delay because of all that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always concerned about keeping the press up-to-date."
Some journalists will challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10th.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to the resentment of the TV reporters 'self-benefit', although she added: 'I do not disagree with the fact that they are self-good'.
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will be more frequent.
'The President is more questionable than any former president,' she said and added without any evidence: 'We have looked at the figures'.
Sanders said that there will still be press conferences, but “if the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to make it happen often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks, and it's gonna replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences when visiting important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause when he did a solo race and at times had a strange behavior in front of a lot of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland regarding Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in the NHS of Scotland to express the country's gratitude and a desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish parliamentary member, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Procurements between the United Kingdom and the European Union on announcement have occurred throughout the summer and are expected to land on a solution for the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to repeat now how much I appreciate the efforts of each coworker, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and outside, add valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work for the health services for the benefit of the patients and local communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Defense player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent urgent surgery after having had a head damage during Saturday 31 - 27 losses to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ in the Tennessean newspaper.
The main coach of Tennessee States, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
"He came out on the sideline and like just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coach and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a bar and took him back for further investigation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV, Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘there is no information on the type/scope of the injury yet’ and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second - year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five tacs Saturday before he ended the game, giving a total of 18 Thanksgivings for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy property in Britain. According to new Tory plans, the additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young electorate.
Document fee increase will be required from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in Britain — and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's plan to attract young people, elects with the promise to offer reasonable housing and strike high-income groups.
The document tax increase will be charged to persons and companies that do not pay taxes in Britain, and the extra money will strengthen the government's action to remedy the situation of the homeless.
The surplus – which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher price imposed two years ago on housing number two and rental housing purchases – may be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the action to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not live in the UK, which drives up prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get their foot in the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spiriting cities” because of the many foreign buyers mostly staying outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson made proposals for a reduction in the document fee to help more young people own their own housing.
He accused large construction firms of keeping the housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May reject quotas on reasonable dwellings to solve the UK's "disgusting housing policy".
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a spectacular series of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unjustified draftings.
He also wants to give the municipal authorities greater power to build new dwellings.
May said: “I said last year that I would consume my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream – that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and create themselves a life here.
However, it may not be as simple for people who do not live in Britain, and also for foreign companies, to buy homes as it is for hard - working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of own dwelling has become far too distant, and the unworthy situation of the homeless remains."
Jack Ross: "My final objective is to lead Scotland."
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42 - year - old shooter enjoys the challenge of resuscitating the Northeast club, which currently holds the third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and it was," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“ But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there is always something that pulls me back.
However, that possibility would only come if I succeeded in the club management.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic chief says he wasn't worried about following such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured whether I can get the club back in the Premier League."
Based on the structure and capabilities of this club, they are undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'd probably just consider myself to have succeeded here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in the lead for three years, after a period of deputy boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month short performance at Heart's coach.
Then he helped Alloa resurrect from downward to third division and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the downward to win the championship subsequent season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the game career of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a proper road separation," he remembers when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought that management was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, created a reasonable income and experienced some fine highlights.
But football can be tough.
There are many things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I go through it in terms of stress and pressure in my job, but management feels quite right to me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do, it feels like the most comfortable I've known throughout my adult life."
You can hear the whole interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
The perfect time for a half-litre is 5:30 on Saturdays, shows a study
The summer heat wave has strengthened the income of Britain’s hard - pressed pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubes and bars experienced an increase in turnover of 2.7% in July – while revenue for restaurants fell 4.8%, shows the figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant CGA, summarized the figures, said: “Continued sunshine and England’s unexpected long participation in the World Cup, July followed a pattern similar to the previous month of June, when pubs went up 2.8%, except for restaurants being hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurant sales in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the very best result, but an increase that was stronger equal to-like than the restaurants went down.
The sun was also difficult to eat, even though it was not as dramatic as it was for the rastaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, turnover increased by 6.6 % that month, with food service decreased by 3 %.»
Paul Newman, an analyst from the RSM hotel and restaurant industry, said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and large sports and social events are still the most important factors for sales on the outside market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still in trouble, and a drop in turnover of 4.8% of the year-on-year will be particularly painful at the top of running cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food service companies, and the time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a long-term breathing space.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including reopenings, was 2.7 % in July, reflecting the upheaval of new trade marks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, business sales manager for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyses the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is the established industry standard.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
One of five children — some only 11 years old — has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study with 20 000 high school students revealed pages of ‘fake Insta’.
The news has increased the concern for the sharing of sexual content.
20% of the students said they had a 'head account' which they show their parents.
One of five children — some only 11 years old — creates accounts on social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A study with 20 000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in Fase Insta accounts – a reference to image sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has increased the concern for the sharing of sexual content.
20% of the students said they had an innocent "primary account" which they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “ rape me. ”
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the principals' conference (HMC) for private schools revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It is terrifying that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the Voice of the Freedom Courts of the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-exercising role in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most decorated sportsman in Scotland, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead the sport to gain insight into her comprehensive international experience over the last ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-wide free sports environment, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am excited to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guide sports in Scotland.”
The American won 200 and 400 meters under the Olympic Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four Olympic Gold.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time will show if I want to be restored and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm fine again and I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing smoothness exercises!
Thank you for all the reassuring messages.
Breast Pump Ad that compares mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A breast - pump company has divided the online opinion with an ad that compares breast - feeding mothers with cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the “first soundless chest pump of the world carried close to the body”, Elvie, the technology-based consumer product company, published a fresh and flirting, music video-inspired ad to show the freedom of the new pump to active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows for a song including the following text: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you didn't understand it, this is not law, it's my boobs."
The corn continues: “Push it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls.”
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused a storm on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, many say the beauty painter the "graininesses" in the meieribor.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth, ” one wrote.
Elvie breast pump gets a nice place in a breast-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Absolutely traumatic for both mother and baby.
But, hey, why not use them to advertise for a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added, "What a failure ad."
Others defend the ad, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I was still breast-feeding.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers pumping (often at work or toilets) and feeling like cows.
This is not an ad that honours or judges the meieriban.’
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they've all danced with the discreet pump in the bra.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes and has a fine place in a breast-bh, so that women get the freedom to move, keep the baby and even walk out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and milk cows, we wanted to put search light on breast pumping and all the challenges, while in an entertaining and recognizable way showing the incredible sense of freedom of the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a two - child mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a camp near the Texas border in secret.
The number of migrant children arrested has been in the weather even though the monthly crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because hard rhetorics and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children with supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by stepping forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household had to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs authorities, witnessed to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who sought to be a support player for single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
‘Nearly 80 % of the persons who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to persecute these people," Albence says.
The officers try to handle their children faster and introduce new rules that allow some of them to meet in court within one month of arrest and not 60 days of previous standard, according to recipient workers.
Many will be presented through a video conference instead of meeting up personally to conduct their suspicion of residence for an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to receiver workers and reports that have occurred in the last few months.
Advocates said that these concerns have grown by a larger plant such as Tornillo, where children who are struggling are easily overlooked by the size of the plant.
They added that the transfer of children to the tent camp without sufficient time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can enhance traumas that many are already experiencing.
Syria asks American, French and Turkish occupational powers to withdraw immediately
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Minister of State, said that the foreign forces were illegal in Syrian soil under the control of terrorism and “will be treated thereafter”.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions are on the run.
He said that Damascus will continue to “keep this holy fight until we have cleansed all Syrian territories” both for terrorist groups and “all foreign presence”.
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and advice of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - devastated country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused “some Western countries” to“squeeze irrational flight” which causes the refugees to stay away.
"We have approached the international community and humanitarian organizations to organise these returns," he said.
They police what is really a mere humanitarian situation.'
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major defence position of the rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political conversations.
The Russian/Turkish agreement prevented a large scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including warriors from Al-Qaida-related Nusra Front, which “will be eradicated”.
The UN Embassy Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to prepare a postwar foundation for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem provided conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the Committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to the review of the articles of the present Constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win another period
After that logic, Trump would have won re-election by 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope for, national law and scandal will end the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly become “the most dramatic conclusion of a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there's no sign of seeing rights.
Since 2014, the best broadcast time views have doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC The Rachel Maddow Show has topped the cable viewers with a total of 3.5 million viewers in evenings with big news issues.
“This is a fire attracted to people because we don’t understand anything,” said Neal Baer, programme manager of the ABC drama “Designed Survivor”, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a recognized comedie maker and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club,” has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote on Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
There's a value of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course — unlike anything else on TV — the events in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reconciled and health to the global economy.
Encouragement is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an enlightened person when you sit six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep dive in background" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with strutsfjjär worth $15,000 (a plague covered with hybris", said Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' colorful descriptions of Trumps, eh ..., anatomi.
At least I don't want to look at Super Mario in the same way anymore.
“Some of what he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, day-to-day leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of “Pawn Stars”, about Trump show’s varied role crew and daily twist on the plot (clashes with NFL, skamrose Kim Jong-un).

When I met Fleiss this week, there was 27 °C and a sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he bured himself in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't break himself loose, not when Brett Kavanaugh is going to meet the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court of the United States.
“I remember when we made all the crazy programs in old times and people said this is the end of the Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the regular intermediate elections to the House of Representatives.
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing a stream of money after a congress change that ended with two seated representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly emerging suburban district in Pittsburg presents with the democratic representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplication election last spring.
Lamb opposes another seated representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who at the moment represents the 12th district of ancient Pennsylvania, which largely overlappes the 17th district.
The map was retracted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were a constitutional manipulation of the constituent constituents in the favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign financing between the main party financing groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a button of victory in a closely followed supplication election for Pennsylvania’s 18th district to Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small lead.
The United States considered criminal action against El Salvador for aid to China, followed by the threat
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team to Trump Organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to revoke the U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, Ministerial spokesperson, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, an estimated $ 140 million in American assistance in 2017, including drug control, development, and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials postponed a summit conference focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar meeting last year, considered as a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
By mid - September, however, officials of the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now prepared to speak to the conference, which is now scheduled in mid-October, to show the importance of the administration adding the meeting, said the diplomat.
And the three American messengers returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new tough messages or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman of the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations under the precondition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analytic who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next nail in the coffin may be special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is supposedly also about to extend the investigation to whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in interference with our elections.
If the Congress were to change side, Trump would be held responsible in that body, in the middle of the preparation to meet the voters again and perhaps finally a jury of his equals.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not mean to claim that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
Choice must be made of all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the length of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a state coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
The course of history is circumventing such waves, and the irreversible March of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans are faced with several of these swinging points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in bad weather ever since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret listenings to the president and wondered that he was incapable of being president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recent FBI review of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the intercom of a congress that will hold Trump responsible?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're gonna fail because of the experiences I got in Prague.

Rangers' Graham Dorran's optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in certainty that victory over the Austrians after the impressive residual fight in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injuries prevented the middle-level player Graham Dorrans from doing his first performance for the season in the residual match 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game and thought we could do something and got one point.
Maybe we could have nicked in at the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better at first, and we came out in second and were the best team.
On Thursday it'll be a big night in Europe.
We hope on three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last fight, but with homepublic in the back, I'm sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
The four years were absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my damage and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boys are having fun; the training is good.
Hopefully we can get on now, put the last season behind us and get it done."
Women lose sleep because of the fear of retirement saving
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few talked to the family about it.
About half the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their mate about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they do nothing to take that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Activities.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to give you care if you do not say what you want in good time in advance.
Discuss with the adviser and family where and how to provide care, for such choices can be of great importance to determine the cost.
Take your financial advisor: The counselor can also help you to find out how to pay your expenses.
The funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance police, a hybrid life insurance police with cash value to help cover these expenses or self-assurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Develop your legal documents: Remove legal problems immediately.
Get a medical authority in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that health workers will meet your wishes if you are to be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving authority to someone over your economy.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your old parents are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write the details in an overview so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy that is at stake – who are the doctors? ” asked Martin.
‘What medicines do you need?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that list in place.”

The victim didn't see the assaulter.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have wanted witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a heavy earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and death rates are expected to rise.
The communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from Donggala’s regentship, a region north of Palu nearer the epicenter of the earthquake with strength 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:

Donggala is a rulership that stretches over 300 kilometers of coastline in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The government, an administrative region under province level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the beams of the central province of Sulawesis economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been repeatedly affected by tsunamies over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesia Emergency Administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit west Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Firering in the Pacific and regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A heavy earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh Province north at Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of heavy earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A strong earthquake 6.8 hit south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast. Near 700 were killed.
2009: An earthquake with strength 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: A strong earthquake 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that ravaged dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A grunt earthquake hit Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while people were reminded of the harassment of the mortal earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by coincidence buildings.
2018: Vigorous earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested by charges of violence at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and Vice President Candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested after an assault charge.
Palin, 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, cluster with a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he's supposed to have taken the phone from a woman's acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged assault.
The Palin is incarcerated in Mat-Su jail and is arrested for an unsafe debt letter worth $500, reported KTUU.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, absolutely" when he was asked how he responded to the guilt question, the network reported.

In December 2017, he was accused of assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case will be brought to Alaska Veteran's Court.

Indonesia quake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island Sulawesi on Friday.
The strong earthquake 7.5 triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated on social media showing the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami thundered across the beach.
Federal Prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City.
New York Federal Prosecutors seek the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, thirty years old, apparently used a rental car from Home Depot to perform an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he melted down footwalks and bikers on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutor must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “deliberately” and caused serious physical injuries intentionally, according to the warning of intention to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal jury held a 22-point position, including eight charges for murder in connection with money blackmail, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge for violence and vehicle rejection.
The assault required 'significant planning and intention', said the prosecutor, who described the way Saipov carried it out as 'happy, cruel and corrupt'.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injuries, property creations and losses for the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, states the intentional warning.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time Southern District of New York brought a case that could give death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York City, in 1953, for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being sentenced for conspiracy to perform spying to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, Uzbekistan, showed no regret in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the detectives that he was pleased with what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching ISIS videos on the phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He did not declare himself guilty after the charge of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the officially appointed defenders of Saipov, said that they were “reasonably disappointed” in the decision of the Prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the traumas of these incidents for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a demonstration at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said that the politicians would get the “sensitive” pressure from the European sceptics – when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he be responsible for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would “be outdated” now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile his deeply divided ranks has been stressed by Pro-Remain Tories who participated in a private demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the relapse – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "caos".
Bone told the "Memory" demonstrants in Solihol that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I want to stand for Brexit, but we have to reject the Brexit plan."
When explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone refrained from claims that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The allegation that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is totally wrong."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Broxit plan is unpopular in the public. The opposition will not vote for it; it is unpopular in the party and in our activists, which are actually the ones who trask the streets and make us first elected.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening.”
In a direct message to May, she added: "Ministers of State keep the job when they keep their promises."
Farage stated that the politicians would be “sensitive” if they were thinking of betraying the decision taken by the 2016 referendum.
"This is now about the trust between us – the people – and that politicians," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to let them know that they will not get away with it."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the edge to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilise the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governmental, proud Britain.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before having a two - hour political assembly in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists waving with Tories Against Brexit banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives of the security problems they had with a party app when the conference started.
“This is the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland”, he added.
"It is a complete father.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering being a presidential candidate.
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the elections in November, she will “evaluate seriously to make a presidential candidate. ”
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about the future during a council meeting west in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is re-electioning in November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, Vice-President of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been central to the speculations if she's going to face Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electorate, who has used the council house format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she was planning to make a presidential candidate.
Warren replied that it is time for women to get to Washington to fix our defective government, and that includes a woman on top.
Arrest station after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting.
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting incident that killed the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near the campus at the Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died as a result," said Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene with a gun, admitted to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without upset and put in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police chamber.
Sims was a two meters high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is aiming at the world championship after stalelords give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stablelords would play a big role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and swept almost Hamilton off the track while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton continue driving in the back of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some scuba with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free after a double pass to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in as number seven at the end of the first round of his 21th anniversary.
Then he led in large portions of the race while lying on the wheels to try to get to a quick conclusion and overwhelmed the Kimi Raikkon, the four - year - old.
Finally, he came to the 44rd round depot but failed to increase the rate of the remaining eight rounds and the Raikkon took the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me through.
The team has done a great job to get a good fool," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court Candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee, but commented on the fact that what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "ondious, horrible, and speak falsely".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last days of the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and mean and terrible and speak falsely," he said.
"When you look at extradition and leakage, they say, "Oh, I did not.
I have not done it.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not leaked."
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't leak, he added, with an imitation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information on the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein refused that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked."
But her denial was not graciously addressed by the president, who during the party event Saturday evening commented: “I will tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court Candidate, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
"They have decided to take back power with all the necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to get power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two targets for Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return fight in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants received early a two-school code by shooting from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie settled for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of Giants.
Francois Bouchard settled for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss for the season of Adam Keefe's men who had come behind after they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
It was the third session of the season between the teams, and Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer’s opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford quit the game when Beauvillier doubled the management four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the homemade back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added to Cownie's counterfeit at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants had the lead on pause when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard reckoned once again with a mastery goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the battle late in second round, and he secured the victory with the team's five halfway out in the final round.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Airlines die to ensure that hundreds of air passengers escape earthquakes
A flight leader in Indonesia is commended as after he died and ensured that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a severe earthquake hit the island Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Vigorous post-shaking continues to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly swift control tower at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway right then, could safely ease.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, California, to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts broke when we heard it," he added.
The government fears that the number of deaths can rise to thousands, and the National Disaster Response Office reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
‘The figures are expected to rise further as many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been possible to reach,’ said the spokesman of the body, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six feet [6 m] high waves have ravaged Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “All the time there are ambulances picking up the dead.
There's a lack of clean water.
The Mini Markets are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross works febrilically to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday and told the country military: “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?' reported CNN.
Indonesia was affected by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crashed in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after a plane crashed in Lagune
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia, says now that one man is missing and reported that all 47 passengers and crews were safely evacuated from the declining plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that every Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they had no record of.
The airline said they worked with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the request for more details of the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the Chuuk island.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all of them was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane missed the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wade through middeep water to the emergency exit of the declining plane.
He said the flyers were panicking and screaming, and that he had a smaller head damage.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a bridge also helped in the rescue work by using a resurrected boat to carry people into land before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG registered flights in the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analytics present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors closed the procedure Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Analytics in the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for hours as expert witnesses in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to bring together the movements of 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he picked up location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, which was contrary to what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers’ cell phone during the time he claimed to have been with Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the testimony box Saturday and claimed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis to tell the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer of Sanford that night, Sanford said that “he was lying because my trailer was in Nashville.”
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile prints suggest that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Telli's calls, contact details and messages were deleted from his phone to and from Chambers.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defense shall begin its procedure on Sunday, as planned.
The judge said he expected the case to be abandoned to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
Childcare in New York is suing couples for resignation after ‘rasist’ message
A babysitter in New York sues a couple for discrimination after receiving a miscommunicated message from the mother who complained that she was “only a black person”.
The couple reject their racism, and compare their application with “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up to the first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEII END A SVART PERSON,” wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After discovering the mistake, it was a ‘uncomfortable’ Plasco-Flaxman who resigned from Maurice by claiming that their dismissed babysitter, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one day of work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the resignation and demands compensation in the amount of $350 a day for the six - month - long housing scheme she was promised, but without contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hey, you just don’t,” she said to New York Post on Friday, and added, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have refrained from the charges that they are racist and say the resignation of Maurice was the only right thing, since they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something that she hadn’t meant to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the man Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"Would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on.
The comparison of the application with blackmail says Plasco was due to the fact that his wife had only two months for a semester and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Is it such a person you want to punish?
It is not very nice,” added the stock broker.
While the legal case is taking place, the public court has been quick to condemn the social media couple and criticize them for their conduct and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not accept a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to sit in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's really funny to know what we know now about Paddington's great success."
She says the father, who had worked as a cameraman in BBC before he was inspired to write the child book by a small cloth bear, would have been very pleased that his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary for the book release was “bitter sweet” after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member” and adds that her father was in secret very proud of his success.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was no boastful person," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you had a child doing a good thing: you are proud of it even though it really isn’t your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he used to give honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
On landing, the daughter had been hurried to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looked bad, that he didn’t think she would survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got the phone from Nad, who said she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be right there.
I'll come to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to cause her heart to beat, slowly lost its effect, and left her system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body clapped together.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it happened.
I couldn’t scream and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers — who did not know about the trials she was undergoing.
"Nobody knew," she says.
"I looked down all the time, and the tears ran in a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards with grieving women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 years old when he was depressed and killed himself when he was 18 years old.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to relive every day, ” she says.
45 - year - old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"All knew him on the smile.
They said his smile could light up any room."
He quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother was one of those who found him after he killed himself.
Sharon says, “I’m worried all the time that it’s going to be an infectious effect.”
Sharon made the cards “to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even if there is only a friend.
Don't sit for yourself - you need to talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon’s friend for many years, lost Mark, his partner through 15, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he felt depressed or depressed or something,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed the changed mood.
The first Christmas day he was in the basement – when the kids opened the Christmas gifts, they didn't get eye contact or anything.”
She says that his death was a great tragedy for them, but they must fight through it: "There is a huge hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we all have to endure and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is hanging in a thin thread while the FBI starts investigating.
“I thought that if we could get some of the things he asked for – a time- and extent-limited examination – we might come to a certain consensus,” said Flake on Saturday, and he added that he feared that the Committee would ‘fell apart’ along locked party limits.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The resentment was due to the timing.
The intermediate elections are only five weeks away, November 6 – if the Republicans are likely to do bad, it will be much harder for them to have the man they want elected to the Supreme Court in the country.
George W. Bush has called Senators and operated lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House of Bush and met her wife Ashley there when she was a personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI delivers his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where at the moment there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate so that Vice President Mike Pence can use his double voice and get him in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean jumpers falls under Kim
The number of North Korean jumpers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, which refers to data from the South Korean Ministry of Collection, said that there had been 1127 jumps last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices of human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't commented publicly.
Most jumpers from North Korea are offered nationality in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border to North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China views the deshoppers as illegal migrants, not refugees, and returns them with power.
The relationship between the North and the South — which is technically still in war — has improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for conversations on the locked negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between the United States president Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will unilaterally rust first,” said Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court Canditat Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statements in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival, Austin, Texas.
“I could only think that if a woman had acted like that, she would be called hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate’s Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied his sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost shouting and weeping when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats of the Committee and called the allegations against him a "grotean and coordinated character killing" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he can't sit in the Supreme Court since it shows that he's predecessored against Democrats.
"I mean he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh for national court if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority of the Representatives' house.
“I want to say this – if he does not tell the Congress and the FBI the truth, he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (absence rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the question, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he wanted to test certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” Pelosi said.
And women have to handle it.
It is a righteous anger, months, and years when her mind takes over, and she cannot get it out without weeping.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so strange, do you?"
She continues: “I received good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she is also crying when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and began crying, she said to the person she spoke to “you think maybe I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And I thought that was amazing."
Tears are allowed as an end to anger partially because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories from one of my first jobs was in a man - dominated office, and I began to cry with unexplained anger and was caught in the neck of an older woman — a cool boss that I had always been a little afraid of — who drew me to a staircase.
"Let them never see you cry," she said.
"They do not know that you are angry.
They'll think you're sorry and pleased because they managed to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he served as presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to cheating on his spouse on board a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the elections, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing wrong in investigating the possibility of making the presidential candidate himself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were one more.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Since it was close to the end of the campaign, she was left behind with the funding and swore that she wouldn’t stand up if she didn’t get $2 million in.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount, or?" she wonders.
When she gave her speech to announce that she did not want to launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration of the system that made it so difficult to drive money in and to reach electorate instead of delegates, and anger over sexism – that she fell together in weeping.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Schroeder of how the press referred to her.
"You should think that Kleenex was my head sponsor.
I can't believe what they would write on my tomb pillar.
"She wept?"
How the Trade War USA-China Can Benefit Beijing
The opening salves in the trade war between the United States and China were deaf, and even though the struggle is far from over, a long - term break between countries can be beneficial for Beijing, says experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by levying customs on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariff rates on goods worth $200 billion, which means the tax of half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Of course, Beijing has repaid every time, now at the latest with five to ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the U.S. attacks for attack, and the world's second largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
Making Washington downstairs means giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States will be far too humiliating to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can give positive counts for China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic disruptions in one of the countries is actually far more dangerous than the spectators have realized before,” said Abigail Grace, a research colleague focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a thoughtsmie.
Syria ‘ready’ for returning refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeal for help to resurrect the country, which has been ravaged after more than seven years of war.
When he spoke at the United Nations National Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are getting better.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress of combating terrorism,” he says.
The state continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now arranged for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their living.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped from the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, six million people still live in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime will welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that no conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the rebellion would be accepted.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won 2018 Ryder Cup after having beaten Team USA with an end result of 16.5 versus 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times after another on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn made the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was struggling during large parts of the tournament, hurt his tee beats in the water at pairs-3, 16 holes, and had to see himself beaten by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all his rounds and became 1 out of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten out 5 and 4 of the lowest ranked player in the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind them, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most winning Europeans of the tournament through the times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't let go.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful Thomas picked me out and believed in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help", said a emotional Garcia after the European victory.
