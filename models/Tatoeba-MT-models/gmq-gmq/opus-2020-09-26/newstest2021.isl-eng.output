Crying at the World
The market campaign Looks like You Need Iceland seems to have started well, and crying out in nature has started to pull into people wide and wide across the world.
“Your own mystery, I need Iceland, ” says one woman in the big world in commentary on the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another spectator claims to keep Iceland in his heart forever, and a young woman says that she has to get to Iceland as soon as she has her fiancée staying there.
Unfortunately, though, she is in the United States and assumes that she will have to wait for a few more months.
Another spectator asks if the walk to Iceland is good, because there are no planes.
It doesn't follow the story if he comes from another time zone.
Egill Thordson of the Peel advertisement agency, with the International Advertising Agency M&C Saatchi, says that it has been hopeful again.
“ I found many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign has already been graduated.
In the basics, it's about creating PR values, it's getting foreign media to deal with the campaign, and it's gone amazingly well.
Over a relatively short period of time, we have been reviewed in some seven hundred world - wide media that cover more than two billion people.
The value of this review is estimated at $1.8 billion.
It's not embarrassing."
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has gone very well there, even though the Americans are not going to the country in advance.
According to Egil, such market areas as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also taken advantage, such as Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
This resulted in a reaction from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically proposed.
“ These advertisements have traveled far beyond what we expected, ” says Egill, but perhaps more than four million people have watched the material on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have asked for a better start. ”
The pictures on the opening took Årni Säberg, the photographer of the Morning newspaper, at the cover of advertisements carrying the title “Let It Out ” in the middle of the last month.
The roofs were made wide and wide, as in the city of Reykjavik, in the city of Reynis, in the land of Forest, in the mountains of the sun, and in a cave near the head of Hjort.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki the son of Peter, and Gunnar Paul the son of Olaf, of Scott's production, and the taker of fear of the son of God.
In part, the Iceland Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary, played a role.
Thousands of Iceland came to make the advertisements, but at the same time as the recordings took place in South, there was another group in the West and the West.
According to Egils, “Let It Out” is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is planned for a winter campaign with M&C Saatchi.
“ This is just the first phase of this work for the Iceland Lab, ” says Egill, adding that cooperation with M&C Saatchi was very successful.
“ Working with them is great.
In such tasks, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to."
Explosive Spirit: Speaking the position on the labour market, pension funds, and much more
Mr. Åsmund Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, will meet in Bombisand, which begins at 10:00 p.m. on the Wave today.
He is also a Minister for Labour and discusses the position on the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other matters.
He also discusses rural areas and moves to a land that has gone poorly and has been controversial over the past few years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, Chairman of the VR, also participates in the programme, but he will discuss his criticism regarding the investments of the pension funds and presents ideas that the labour movement and professionals will withdraw from the governments of the funds to reduce the risk of interest problems.
Then they will be discussed with Ivar Ingimarsson, a traveller in Austria, and with Joan’s daughter, Director of the Nordic Marketing Agency, on the status of travel services in the countryside.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder if the summer’s success is a misleading precedent for what will come.
You can listen to the scene below, which begins at 10:00.
That's what she looks like today 25 years later.
The actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in all kinds of youth programs.
However, she was world famous for her play as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
Then she also played the Sabrina shows: The Teenage Witch with Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
She has been a little touched recently, but she was motivated to look over the way and express herself about Clueless in Australian television on the days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a great person.
“ I must admit that I was mostly based on girls I met at school who were not good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this person was," said Donovan about his play in Clueless.
I didn't want to leave the police station after a night's stay.
About fifty cases came on the police board in the capital area today, saying in the police diary that things were different.
The day of the police station in District Street began by the police having to intervene with a man who had recently been released from a prison cell after staying there because of drunk driving.
The man would not leave after he was released and did not obey the instructions of a police officer who told him to leave.
The man gained a continued stay at the police station because of his progress.
Then a man was arrested in the morning year suspected of a burglary in a company in Copavogi.
The police also had to intervene with two people in Breiholt because of reports of physical assault.
Then, too, a woman sitting at dinner at a shopping center in Copavogi could not pay for the account after the meal, so she was called to the police.
It was also reported that a car was stolen in the center of the city this morning.
White Renault’s driver looked at her for a moment, and she was taken freely.
The car hasn't been found yet.
The Curse of the Glade Force - The horrible Destiny of the Glory
The theory has reached a flight on the Internet for a curse over the show of the Glade Force, but the actor Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days, thus becoming the third main player of the shows to put life ahead long ago.
The themes about the joy team (Glee) are a popular series of shows about singing, dancing, and joy.
The programs dealt with the so - called joy band of youths in high school, their loves, and fate.
Being in the joy band was not always taken out, but through singing and dancing, the characters appeared to overcome any situation in their lives.
But outside the scenes, there have been great disasters over the players and the staff of the programs, so much that the teachings have been raised that the programs have been cursed.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez, a cheerleader who did not call all his grandmother.
After the series had run its stage, Rivera began to own the actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and divorced them.
However, Dorsey refused to prosecute, and the domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8, last, Riveru was reported to be missing after her four - year - old son was found alone on a boat in Lake Piru, California.
The boy felt asleep in a rescue vest on board the boat, and he could tell the police that he and his mother had swimped themselves, and then Rivera would have brought him back into the boat, but never returned there.
A vast search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police officer in the area reported that we were looking for Rivera’s drowning.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially executed.
It is believed that she had a heavy tide in the water and was renewing her last requirement to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded drunk by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the shows, the American footballer with the angelic voice that played a key role in bringing the Glade Force to glory and honor.
Outside the shows, Moneith wrestled with personal devils.
Since 13 years of age, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his associates felt sufficiently involved, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment, and everything seemed to look for a better way.
Only two months after he finished his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after having gone out for fun with friends.
Banamein was a fatal combination of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that it was a deliberate act.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerability before drug administration had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated was fatal.
He was only 31 when he died.
His death was heavy on his associates, but on the basis of his adversary’s wife, Lea Michele, he was determined to continue taking the shows and devoted them to Moneith’s entire memory and to Finn’s character.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah “Puck ” Puckerman in the shows, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and he had little respect for his fellow students in the Glade Team, or until he got the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles suspected of child porn protection.
At his home, he found a huge amount of child pornography, and the matter soon became public.
Clearly, Salling had gone.
He was then accused and convicted of his transgressions.
He was headed for four or seven years in prison, as well as he would have to have a record of sexual offenders and seek the treatment of childish love.
Before a judge had decided the punishment, Salling, who was then free from insurance, found himself dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just the actors who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
In 2013, only 41 years of age, he was immersed in sleep.
On the scene, a woman named Nancy Motes also worked.
She was a younger sister of Julia Robert’s great star, who had no beauty in her sister’s history, but she accused Robert of great government and disrespectful behavior.
In 2014, Motes, who had a severe depression, killed herself.
She left a letter to her fiancée, where she asked her mother and sister, among other things, was responsible for what happened to her.
“ My mother and my so - called siblings will get nothing from me except the memory that they caused my worst depression. ”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
Recently, she has been accused of mobbing and mobing with her accomplices at the scene and having a superb star.
Jesse Luken took part in the programs in 2012.
He was arrested and charged for drunken driving in 2019, which was very scandalous.
The actress Heather Morris played a big role in the shows.
In 2010, unwrapped computer scumbags were found in naked pictures and published on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played the shows and had a relationship outside the shows.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used violence in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything
When children are allowed to play in the garden with their parents to cultivate flowers and to watch them grow and thrive.
It is also possible to make with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points to.
Just having time with your children in the garden is something that never will be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Buying a boat after tenth grade
“ I don’t think we’re many seamen working at the schools of the country, ” says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, who is fishing on the coast during summer but studying psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter. ”
Coastal fishing is a very comfortable summer work when you are studying.
If the fish are well fished, you can have a good income, and I'm glad to be able to let go of study loans.
And the earnings also do me well in the winter," says Axel, son of Godmund, a 25-year-old psychologist, who hunts in the sea in summer, as in the summer.
Axel was the newest to the dock at the Tálknappe when a journalist got his voice late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“ The wet I was in tenth grade, I took the commanding rights for boats less than 12 meters long, and I bought my boat the summer after I finished my primary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summers since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, John’s son Hartman, and I gave the boat his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being to sea, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat was bearing his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat, ” says Axel and adds that he bought the boat for three million.
“ I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, and the other half at the end of the summer when I had been fishing.
So I had no debt to the boat at the end of my first summer on it."
How, though, could a boy have a million and a half to pay in a boat when he had just graduated from high school?
“ I had put up a job and collected money, I had been working with my father to sea when I was a boy, I was all summers fishing with him, and I got my share.
I also put my peak money in my boat fund."
Axel was born in Issapherd, from wherever all his mothers are: but he has lived in Copavogi since he was a boy.
“ I can hunt here in the west area because I have a legal home at my grandmother’s home at Icefjerd.
I learned in these areas west of the south with my father.
I move between distances depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all the West.
Although I find it best to be in the west, I have also given around the Snow Falls and elsewhere.
I have also given southern, but then most gray drops," says Axel, who always robs one early in the morning and says that he sometimes speaks to the moons and sings to the heavens, in the lonely hours of the ball sea.
“ The online connection on the sea is good, so I can call, listen to video shows, and music.
I don't think it's a problem to be alone.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into danger, but sometimes something has been in the weather, but never a great danger," says Axel, who is lucky to be never sea sick.
He says the length of the day’s work depends on how fishing takes place each time.
“ I’m never more than 14 hours on a fishing trip, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, such as in the rent quote, but I’ve been on a biscuit for a and a half hours at sea fishing. ”
He claims that the sea fishing arrangement enables him to hunt 770 pounds a day, which he finds hampering.
“ Other restrictions are that I must not hunt Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I may hunt only 12 days a month, these four months during sea fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their hunting days by weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is for people to calm down instead of having 48 days over the summer and to be able to choose according to their heads.
So the perimeter could also go for me, and sea spaces that are well located in the fishing areas should be enjoyed," says Axel, who draws most of the cod from salted seas on their coastal fishing, but also only the fuss and exceptional other types of rivers.
Axel works during the winter course of college at Nupi theatre in Copavogi.
“ I don’t think we’re many sailors working at the schools of the country, ” says Axel proudly, adding that he was only planning to work temporarily at the theatre school.
“ I got stuck there because I think this great job.
I hope that my psychology study will benefit me in my future theatrical level," says Axel, who is also advanced in business science.
Registration error prevented retirement ambiguity
An error in a registration paper that people fill out when they arrive in the country caused an individual living in this country not to be re-invited.
A identification number is not required if the person fills out the form in English, as it is when it is done in Icelandic.
“ This will be examined this week, ” says a medical expert in the field of medical care.
Three internal diseases were detected at the Virologic Department of the District Hospital yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the application of the so - called home sickness rules.
Those living in Iceland are then scrutinized at the arrival of the land and again proclaimed in the show four to five days later.
In RUV’S noon news, however, it was noted that the person had followed the old system.
It was negative, and it was not reappeared in the screening for the virus.
Camilla Rut Sigfusdaughter, a medical specialist in the field of medical care, says in a discussion with a news agency that this is a mistake in the electronic registration paper.
If you fill out the registration paper in English, you do not need to enter a identification number, as in the Icelandic version.
In conclusion, this was primarily thought for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person was not automatically invited to show up.
However, Kamilla says that many have followed the rules on the return portal even though they have completed the English registration form, and in some cases employers have also been alert to send people back to show after they arrived in the country.
“ This will be considered in the week how to make it easier for people to get their attention to this process. ”
The man is in isolation, and six have been placed in a clinic.
They all go to a show, but two were beginning to show symptoms.
The three diseases that were diagnosed yesterday are now in progress, mostly due to two reports on Friday.
In both cases, a serial analysis of Icelandic gene analyses has shown that there are varieties of the coron virus that have not been detected in the past.
In another case, the link has been pointed out that Israel, although it is known that the person who transferred the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are now in isolation based on COVID. ice.
135 are in a dilemma.
Four out of five non-associated infections
Five internal diseases have been diagnosed in this country in the past few days.
Of them, four alphas are unconnected and are not yet found at the Rey Cup sports convention yesterday.
Infection is still in progress.
Originally, in the third ten, they were sent to an infirmity, which was reduced to sixteen.
Overall, 34 people suffer from these new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that is diagnosed by sports events and has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Johan K. Johannsson, Head of Public Defense Department, says this slowly, as long as people follow standards and regulations.
“ We are constantly implying to all those living here that individual protection is needed.
We also need to emphasize to those who are attending events that there are certain rules that need to be applied.
Then is it possible to keep an event," says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by exercising individual protection.
In addition, rules and standards are subject to constant review.
“ What needs to be done, and what the public protection department and the local medical office are constantly implying for people is considering these individual contraceptives.
Both at home and at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents infection from going on," says John.
“ We need to urge people to continue on the good road we were on in order to sustain the results we have so far. ”
40% of the victim COVID-19 had diabetes mellitus 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father was to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was caused by sudden difficulty in breathing due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetic disease was indicated on the death certificate as the underlying problem and is Brumfield, also diabetic.
Reuter's reporter says Brumfield's fear doesn't have no reason.
A new study that has been conducted by the U.S. authorities shows that nearly 40 percent of those who have died had diabetes 2 as underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is considered, the ratio increases to half.
A study of the United States Disease Control (CDC) included more than 10,000 people in 15 countries that died from the crown virus during the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, a CDC specialist, says the results are striking, especially for diabetic patients 2 and their loved ones.
Reuter’s slow growth led to an examination and pointed out the answers from the 12 countries responding to comparable proportions.
10 countries, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet reported underlying diseases.
“ Sickness was already pandemic in slow growth.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful age," has Reuters by Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes are more common among blacks and people of South American origin, which have also worsened the corona virus.
One of the best precautions for diabetic patients is to keep the disease under control by exercise, healthy diet, and healthcare professionals.
However, the Korean virus epidemic has made it difficult for many to keep a routine.
In this case, high prices of insulin have forced some to continue to attend the work and thus risk exposure to the virus.
Reuters points out that the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risk that diabetics 2 may be caused by the virus.
In 2003, more than 20% of the SARS corona virus had the disease, and in 2009, this group had a three-fold higher risk of hospitalisation.
In 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were enrolled in intensive care were diabetic.
According to Dr. Charles S. Dela Cruz, scientist at Yale University, because of the effect of the COVID-19 virus, the epidemic could have deprived the cover of many previously unfamiliar complications.
“ I fear that we will see flooding problems when this is over, ” says Andrew Bolton, President of the International Association of Diabetes.
Physicians have warned that the crown virus epidemic could indirectly lead to an increase in the complications associated with diabetes, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new studies suggest that the crown virus may lead to an increase in the incidence of diabetes.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the connection between the corona virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, a system that is already weak in many diabetic patients.
In this case, a high percentage of glucose and lipid in diabetic patients may induce a true “cell signal storm, ” as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged intestinal cells may also lead to inflammatory formation, which can again cause fatal blood clots.
“ This is all one big puzzle, ” says Dela Cruz.
"This is connected to all of the intersections."
The news has been corrected.
"We were invited champagne, and then they left the room"
The couple of Asruna, Michael’s daughter and Atli Bollason, received the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Gargamel’s son to have sex in front of a camera before the artist’s work in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t complicated. ”
So atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and mother, Asruna, the daughter of Michael.
“ I was very impressed by her.
It was naturally just the radiation, but then I thought it was quite insensitive.
And still feels," he says.
Asrún also remembers this end, the husband regularly recalls the first meeting.
“ I’m always hearing this story.
Lastly just this weekend," she says, who also attracted the husband at first.
“ I felt and feel so excited around Atla that I like.
There's a lot going on and much going on, and I was fascinated by it."
Atli says that her husband and wife have stressed it in their relationship to go their own ways.
“ We do not tie our backs the same knots as travelers.
We avoid routines that we detect around us."
There may be a reason why they took the business from Ragnari, the son of Gargamel, just a cheerful artist, even if that would be less than unusual.
“ Our Christian friend Anna contacts us and asks if we can come to eat desert with him, Ragga and Ingi save Ragnar’s wife, at Snaps. ”
They accepted the invitation, met the three oak on Snaps, and had desert wine and each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for a art show that he thought was going to set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris, in the fall.
“ He had a multi-channel video project called Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Asrún says that he described the work as a banal and decadent late in the everyday life of Western people.
“ He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot, and last time he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in. ”
The Senan that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was to show young interclass couples love in a minimal room.
“This is intercourse with the beginning and the end, ” says Atli.
The couple did not know much about Ragnar even though they knew of him and he “but they knew us and felt fit for this.
They had the reputation that they did not want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn't get the right people, but people who got sexual masturbation from performing for others."
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“ When we got out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Are we not just ready to do this? ’
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and all his team," says Asruna and Atli.
"This is about love and the nearness"
The Senan was taken up in a fine apartment on the street.
There was a very small team of films; a cameraman, Ragnar, and a soundman, and the couple.
After the tape had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
“ We hadn’t decided what we should be like.
We received some little instructions, but we tried to forget time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Asroon.
But was that romantic?
“ Yes, it was a little romantic, ” says Atli and Asruna.
“ We were invited for champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved them.
“ When a cameraman looked at it, ” says Atri, “he cried, and he thought it was so beautiful. ”
“ It’s as much about love as about the nearness as about the intercourse itself, ” says Asruna.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother heard the voice of his son at Reykjavik’s Museum of Art and then realized that he was part of the work.
“ Then she turns around and starts to think about it, ” says Atri.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that way, but then Dad just sent me a message and says, ‘ It's nice to meet the little family in Palais de Tokyo, ’ assoon recalls.
And would the involvement of the work have deepened the relationship between Asruna and Atla?
“ At least we're still together, so maybe it deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with my relative, ” says Asruna and laughs.
Asrún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“ I found it a little difficult not to be with you, but with someone else, ” she says and turns to her husband.
“ But it was nice to see this because it’s just one late job, and when you saw it with the other work, it’s really cool.
I could cut myself a little off from this and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach, ” says Asruna, who was pregnant by one of the couple’s children when the late stage was taken up.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Asruna and Atla in love stories at Channel 1.
Swansea with victory in the first game of playback
Swansea won one-0 win at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the teams in the playback to get into the English outfit.
The game took place in Swansea, Wales.
Half-play position was 0–0.
The people of Swansea had a sixty - sixth - minute hell, but Andre Ayew failed by the white point and was defended.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a player of Brentford, received the red card.
So Brentford played the rest of the game less than you, and in the 82th minute, the players of Swansea took advantage of the difference.
Andre Ayew then made up the wheat mess by scoreing great goals and guaranteed Swansea 1–0 victory.
So Swansea leads between 1 and 0, but the second game takes place next Wednesday at Brentford's homefield.
Ambassador-free for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. Ambassador of Iceland, is in the headlight of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted a armed bodyguard, fearing his life.
However, the President of the United States has not succeeded in appointing an ambassador in this country.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned from the U.S. ambassador at the end of April 2009, the country has been ambassadorless for 62 months, over five years.
Van Voorst resigned under strange circumstances, but Kastlys reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falcon word.
On the way to a greeting meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the presidential office that she would not be honored.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international communication with the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst’s successor arrived, in September 2010.
In some cases, Robert S. Connan had been appointed ambassador, but then he resigned.
Eventually, Loius Ariega had served in the foreign ministry for decades.
Then, in the fall of 2013, he resigned from his office as a ambassador in Guatemala.
Then another ambassador took a period of time.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Congress in January 2015, and soon there was no ambassador at that time for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not a diplomat, but had served as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama’s election fund.
He quit his job as soon as Donald Trump took over the presidential office, January 20, 2017, as usual with a politically appointed ambassador.
Trump government was unusually long to appoint both ambassador and highly appointed officials in the Washington government system.
So two years passed until the United States Congress announced Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to ask him his questions and to confirm after the end of his ambassador in Iceland.
In his witness at the Senate he said he had never come to Iceland, but often to western Europe, but his dead wife had been broken by Dutch rocks.
Gunter is politically appointed, previously a skin doctor in California, and has been prominent in the Jewish association of the Republican Jewish Coalition, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded them, but Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, where no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, the longest example of the country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s government was to designate people to a key office and that during the last few years the United States Congress has been working very long, including attending ambassadors.
Thus, since 2009, for more than five years, there has been ambassadors in Iceland.
However, this has not prevented the operation of the Embassy, which opened newly headquarters at Engateig.
The results are considered to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the safety walls surround the building with bulletproof glass in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador with a sense of security, for he is said to be afraid of his life and has desired to have an armed bodyguard.
Former player IBV suffered racism in Iceland - “It was a mistake to come to Iceland ”
Tonny Mawejje, former player of IBV, claims to have suffered racism when he was in Iceland and regrets his arrival in the country.
This is seen in an interview with Tonny, appearing at the Uganda Media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC, who plays in Uganda’s top department.
During the Daily Monitor interview, Tonny discusses many things, including his time in the country, who played with IBV, Val, and Sport in Iceland.
“ When I arrived in Iceland, I did not play in the middle as I used to play.
The leader of the team was in that position, but he also had the T-shirt number I wanted, so I didn't get either of what I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right side of the season with IBV.
What Tonny talks about is racism that he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when playing in Europe.
“ This happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the case, and then I asked my friend what it was about.
Then he told me that my opponent let racist comments fall about me after I accepted him."
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, joining Haugesund.
There he says he made the mistakes he regrets most.
Tonny had not been able to get on the first team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the country team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland for a loan, and he joined Val.
“ It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on a loan.
I think if I had stayed longer in Norway, I would have had the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland destroyed his dreams of getting into a big party in Europe.
Found a worm in the neck of a woman
Physicians at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3,8 - yard black worm in the neck of a woman who searched for it.
Physicians were able to pull out the worm with a tang.
A study revealed that there were parasites.
CNN reports this.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashimi, which is thin meat bites.
The woman quickly recovered after the worm was removed, but such parasites are often in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, sushi’s predication in the West has increased in cases where parasites have been spread.
Fear of the start of another wave in Europe
Spain is now focusing on concerns about the second wave of the crown virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to re-establish the spread of the crown virus epidemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been placed on ice for two weeks, more cities than Barcelona, where infection increases.
Other European countries have also taken action because of the increase in infection in Spain, but in Britain all have to go to an epidemic when returning from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned of travels to Spain.
In France and Germany, there is also a growing number of infections, where governments try to balance the spread of the virus and resume economic life.
The situation in Europe, however, is good in other parts of the world, but the recent world-wide incidence of infection is close to 300,000 per day, the most contagious in America and South Asia.
According to the John Hopkins University, there are 16 million worldwide confirmed diseases, and there are 644 thousand confirmed deaths associated with the virus.
Mosaic Works Are Eventually Fully Enjoyed
In front of the Tollhouse in Reykjavik, there is a large and deep hole.
Above it, men have orange helmets.
There's a big grave too.
And more less work machines.
The gate is closed for traffic.
But the fortress is good, and many now stop and look at the arts of millions of mosaic chips — just as they have never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least not considered that.
So far, the work has been hidden, directly in front of it, was a parking lot that was always enclosed.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped off to do their business in the city.
The "smooth and varied public space" and "attracting city brakes" are guidelines for the regeneration of the current Trouble Street.
The goal is to make the area more beautiful and to allow the Mosaic work of a Holy Door at the Tollhouse to enjoy a better vision.
In addition to the job, the area is well suited as a stay area for passengers.
The artwork will be illuminated and will now make the wood more enjoyable than before on this 142 square meter surface.
There will also be small “clouds, ” some kind of water sculptures, who offer a game and give the area certain mystery.
In this way the reforms are described by the Reykjavik City, which is being carried out along with the Waters.
The renewed water system, heat and electricity will be renewed.
Many of these have come to their ages, but the wastewater and cold - water layers have been since 1925 and have served in the center of the city for almost a century.
Once the street is reopened after it is completed, cars can drive around it again.
However, it becomes a single road, and at the same time it creates more quiet and accessible space for walking.
In a story about the Tollhouse on the customs office’s website, the house was in use in 1971, an architect named Gísli Halldór, the son of God.
Because a harbour reached through the house, 250 square meters of windowless wallpapers were formed to the street.
The construction committee and architects agreed that such surfaces would have a bad effect on the entire street picture, unless special arrangements were made to make the house look good.
Thus, the members agreed to make a permanent work of art.
At that time, a great deal of word was made by the artwife of the Helgadótter, an artist, says in the summary.
If she had done much music in Germany and elsewhere, she would have done much.
The decision was to contact her first before deciding whether the project would be competitive.
Often it had been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the port, for the port had been the life of Reykjavik since it was made.
When discussing with the artist, she had to become enthusiastic about such a work.
She agreed that she would receive drawings and other help before leaving the country, where she would work on the suggestions abroad.
When she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the job.
At the same time, the brothers of Oidtmann, who had worked with them for a long time to set up famous artworks throughout Europe, were asked to make a complete contract with her.
Contracts took place, and the art work was performed in the setup of the offices of the brothers who then arranged for the customs office.
The whole work was outstandingly accomplished, both by the hand of the Helgadótter and by the brothers of Oidtman, says the summit.
Ever since, it has endured a relentless Icelandic weather.
It took about two years to do the work that was done and started in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the customs office was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing to transfer more institutions to the country
Mr Åsmund Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs, proclaims that more official organizations will be moved to land soon.
That's what a minister in the Bombisandi show said at the Wave at lunch.
Recently it was announced that the fire area of the Housing and Manufacturing Agency will be moved north to a sheep farm in the fall.
Six burning specialists work at the Agency, but none of them intend to follow the Agency north and have been criticized by the National Association of Firefighters and Emergency Transporters.
“ I think we should take further steps in this way.
I'm preparing for further steps in this realm.
More transportation," said Åsmundur.
Says he is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more public organizations around the country.
“I think there is a need to make further political decisions on the transfer of official activities to the country, as I was doing with the House and Manufacturing Agency, ” said Ásmundur, but he also took examples of other agencies that have been transferred to the country and were of great importance to communities outside the country, such as the transport of the Food Agency to Selfos, Iceland's Land meters to Akraness and unemployment insurance at Skagaststrand.
All The Greatest From the Second Day of Championship
Iceland’s Championship of Free Sports ended at Thorsparkelli, Akureyri, today.
Some convention records were set on the second day of the race.
While an exciting race was calculated in women's coarse attack in Thordsvangi, Vigdís John's daughter from FH put Iceland Met in a stroke in 2014, which stood until Elizabeth Rut Rwannars' daughter from IR added the score in May of last year.
In the past summer, Vigidis won the Iceland Estimate back earlier and has been in fantasy form lately, but she has threefolded the Iceland Estimate of the summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been injured and has not recovered today.
She had only one valid throw of five, throwing 25.69 yards, which is far from her best.
The longest of all today, or 60.08 meters [60.08 m] in her last experiment, was thrown into a convention.
Her iceland estimate earlier in July was 62.69 feet [62.69 m], so she was quite different.
The carite’s daughter of Hallgrim from the IR had the second best shot of the day, but she improved her best success by throwing up to 50.18 feet [50.18 m].
In a man's group, the FH-man Hilmar Örn Jonsson, the Iceland Meat Sea, won a safe victory, but he threw 73.84 yards in his next last throw, and set a record.
His iceland rating in the article is 75.26 meters.
The God of God, the Son of God, the Olympic Passor and the Iceland Meteoric, won a race in a bullet-cast on the Thorspark yesterday, but today he competed in a broadcast that is his main article.
The Godna Vals is 65.53 meters [65.53 m] of Iceland, which cast the longest 59.13 m [59.13 m] today and secured his victory.
Valdimar Hjalti, the son of Foreign, was thrown the next longest day, but he had one valid attack that worked at the second seat, 49.43 meters [49.43 m].
Havdís, a long - straw sea of Iceland, won the long - to - bet race with superiority, but Havdís jumped at a maximum of 6,25 meters [6.25 m] today, which is less than 40 cm [40 cm] from her Iceland.
In the 200-yard race of women, it was the IR's Godsaving Jonathan Bjarnatótt, who was squirming, but she scored in 24.04 seconds, but her Iceland Met in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Jona’s life was a winner of Akureyri, but she won two gold prizes yesterday, in a 100 - yard race, and in a 4 - x 100 - yard message race, as well as in a 4 - x - 400 - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y - y.
In a group of men, Kolbein Hader Gunnarsson from FH was the first to mark in the 200 - yard race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Oliver Month Samuelsson from the Årmann.
Like Jonathan’s God - saver, Kolbein Hader won gold in the 100 - metre of yesterday as well as in the 400 - yard race.
Don't get a fine for $27 million Bitcoin harvest
The High Tax Committee has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who claimed guilt on a person for neglecting his financial contributions to be made for the sale of the Bitcoin electronic coin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigator had not given clear reasons for the need to indict the man.
The Committee’s decision states that the tax investigator considered that the man had recovered materially incorrect tax statements for the 2016 and 2017 income years.
He would have underlined his financial contributions that would have come from the sale of the electronic coin Bitcoin up to 27 million, either intentionally or with a magnificent lack of care.
Injure the man for his conduct.
The man rejected it in a letter to the Committee.
However, he did not sell electronic coins for 27 million in 2016.
In 2009 and 2010, he would have obtained it with funeral when it would have been easy and cheap with a regular home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the electric coins, the tax resulting from such sales had been substantially unclear and unforeseen.
Such measures could not have been expected by public citizens.
He would not have failed to pay tax on the harvest and would have accounted for his ownership of a claim as an asset on a currency account.
He would have asked both the experts and the governor how this would be done but without success.
Then he felt that he had to be taken into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began burying Bitcoin.
So he would have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities would not have made clear.
Thus, the man felt right that his tax for these two years of income would be redetermined and stressed but otherwise not punished.
Then he reiterated that he worked in Iceland and paid taxes in this country since 2012.
He would never have been planning to get away from his responsibilities in an improper way.
The requirement for guilt was in full measure and would put him in debt.
A pancreas brings about: “This man understands what football is ”
Andersen Willumsson's pancreas has been a bit between people's teeth, but it's also impressed because of the progress that's done with a big time in Pepsi Max.
Blinks will be on the fireline tonight when they meet the IA on the live broadcast at Station 2 Sport.
A pancreas then takes out the ban for four reminders of the season and does not come to play with a new haircut like in the games of the summer so far.
He had been written “bla, bla, blah” on his head for the game at the HK last Thursday, which HK won between 1 and 0.
“ I don’t know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but speaking of the character, it was much better to try the game.
He wasn't hiding.
He wants the ball every time, and if there was someone going to balance this game, I thought he would do it or make it," said Godmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max booty, when counting on the Brown Santa Claus.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ It’s hard sometimes to realize what his position is.
He looks a little out on the left when it begins to pass at the games, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Hjört Havledason.
Thorkell Moon Petersson says to Brynjelf, a real entertainer, delighting to have such a colorful man in the department: “No one disputes that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and to always be ready to come and answer in interviews.
There's a lot of people busy with him, who tells me that this man understands what football is.
“ I am a entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the interviews at Brynjelf, people are paying themselves in and watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Moon.
Player KR says he wants to leave the partner - "I've been in touch with a few teams in B Division"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in Pepsi Max, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to reach the beginning of the period in his home country, but for this, he must first quit his contract at the KR, where the Danish department begins before the Icelandic probability.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and have shown great understanding, ” told Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“ I’ve been in touch with a few teams in the B division, and I’m likely going to change before the Iceland season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark who can allow themselves to pay up my contract at the KR."
Then he says that he is likely to have to face a reduction in his wages in Denmark.
“Companies in Denmark have probably experienced more the economic effects of the virus than in Iceland. ”
Bjartmar has recovered a bike for millions - now responding to DV review
For more than a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had an interest, unlike most others.
He punches up and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric wheels, and bags.
Has Bjartmar gained the name “the wheelshifter. ”
Yesterday, when you published a story about your relationship with Bjartmar, you had a lot of feathers.
The DV then referred to the Facebook group of Western improvements, where it was noted that Bjartmar spoke to the man in Eastfield and said that the vespan might be stolen.
There was nothing else to read from the original writings of the electric shooter than that Bjartmar was the thief.
These texts have now been changed to Facebook and the original DV news headline updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says original news of the case at all not describing what really happened yesterday in Eastfield.
Bjartmar claimed to have received information from the victim of the electric bullets that they were indeed their electric missiles.
This information was received by other owners, but the information proved wrong, says Bjartmar.
“ I saw the guy, and I knew about the shuttle, even though there was a missing electric shell that had been searched for for a long time.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him prepare to drive on the shuttle, I decided to hit the man to talk.
The owner was certain of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Generally, I'm doing a very nice thing about this, but before I got to finish what I had to say, the man had taken it off."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric shell immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the wheel and himself called to the police.
“ Yeah, great, ” said Bjartmar, “Let's just get this straight. ”
Then the owner of the electric shell proved the possession of its electric shell and drove off.
Later, as reported in the previous news, the right owner of the electric shell reported his story on Facebook.
In this more year, Bjartmar has been practicing this practice, saying that he can count the times he landed on the other hand’s fingers.
“ I have dealt peacefully with the most difficult men in Reykjavik, ” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are the longest of the smallest brothers and sisters in the community, addicts, psychopaths, and other people who are on the street for some reason.
“Sorry, ” says Bjartmar, “the addiction is a tough master and somehow the next dose needs to be financed.
“ My dealings with these people are really so good that I have brought many of the good people along with me.
There are examples of people who went to treatment and took on themselves, then approached me and helped me with what I’m doing, ” he says.
Generally, Bjartmar’s communication with bicycles is polite.
Some people know about him and what he's doing, and offer peacefully to show him the receipts, the number of wheels, and so forth.
Bicycle stealing is a major problem that has not been discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even pointing people to talk to him because of stolen bicycles.
Brights disagree with the previous DV news transfer and do not claim to be a self-ordered policeman in personal search for justice.
Asked if he is not now on the hail of ice by his actions, and if this is not the main role of police, Bjartmar so certainly is.
“ Of course, the police should do this, but the fact is that the police are simply not doing this.
I've got to picture watching police run away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
She's purely said in these matters.
“ When the cops are not doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this issue, why not? ” ask Bjartmar.
He claims that he has achieved such a great deal of success in having stolen wheels that sometimes he encounters his “criminals ” on the street that they were just right to the Brighter wheels that they had previously recovered.
The times Bjartmar has called for police help have happened to her simply not be present.
“ It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault and it’s not the owners of the bikes, ” said Bjartmar, and it’s sad that the victims of bicycle thieves have to suffer for the emptyness of police in this issue.
The success of Bjartmars is not shared.
Stories of people can be found thanks to Bjartmar for having restored their possessions.
Even Bjartmar says that the number of bicycles he has returned has long been lost, but the sums will probably run in millions, if not millions.
Weighing there electric sweeps, electric wheels, and electric skirts, electric wheels may cost up to half a million.
Bjarts work on a day until school, and every other weekend he works in a room.
Thus, his search for wheels is unpaid work that he does during his vacation.
Emergency Funds and Long Shadows
In 2019, there was a great birthday year in the history of a pension fund in Iceland.
True, officials had received pension from the king of Dana all the streets of the 19th century, but in 1919 the pension fund was established by officials who eventually became the pension fund of all officials.
The foundation of the current pension funds of general wages and salaries was then placed on a global labour market in 1969, which provided for an occupational pension fund with obligatory funds and a valid fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
Then, in 1974, laws were laid down on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to grow after that.
The payers ’ pension system was not the only drastic change in the labor movement of the 20th century by their battle.
Unemployment insurance had been similarly achieved in historical strikefights in 1955, and the organization gradually met its health and health requirements, significant leave rights, shortening work hours, housing improvements, and other important things.
All these rights cost a lot of struggle but proved to be much more and more lasting than the increase in wages, which disappeared as hard in the huts of inflation, which characterized the postwar period and up to 1990 as many memories.
The attractor to the establishment of a general pension fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although the fact that the funds were actually owned by a fund, the labor movement had to agree that their governments were appointed to represent professionals and fund partners.
In the next few years after the fund was instituted, the majority of workers were required in the management of the funds often for discussion in the employees’ organizations, but it never came to pass, so we still have the abnormal arrangement that the fund representatives are not in the majority of the funds governments.
Article 36 of the Act No 122/1997 on the obligation to guarantee pension rights and activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the Funds.
It says in the number 1 that “a pension fund must be guided by a fund’s interests. ”
Also, the fifth issue says: “A living fund must set moral standards in investments. ”
The shareholders of the Employee Fund include the following provisions, followed by the abovementioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and economic investors in the west and in Europe.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good governance of companies, can contribute to improved investment performance in stockpiles.
Thus, the interests of investors and the goals of society are combined in a wider context.
The LV considers that it is important that companies, especially those registered in stock markets, set a public policy on: maintaining a good governance system of social and environmental responsibilities.
The Value Fund, with the largest stocks of the country, has set “the policy of responsible investments, ” with similar rules.
It's all recalled here as an introduction to the latest fashion word of the Icelandic, "shadow management".
Since the word is new in the case, it is not hoped that it was fully defined, but I now think the following definition is “most taken: shadow management is it when a head of a class community says in the media that he is going to send representatives of the Society to the administration of a pension fund instructions or instructions on how to take their stand in a specific matter.
If they do not comply with the recommendation, they will be dismissed by the government at first suitability.
However, if the leader does not bring this into the media and does not talk about discontinuation, it is not “shadow management, ” since such communications are, of course, always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader consider the way he feels “shadower. ”
In particular, two men have tried to shape this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
These are the hard Egisson journalists of the News magazine, and Ásgeir, the banking manager of Jonsson.
The motive of both occurred after President Bogi Nils Bogason had told President Icelandair of his intention to terminate the association's agreements with airlines and airlines (resigning them), and Mr Thor Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Trade Society, sent them out the recommendation to the representative of the Society of the Life Pension Fund of merchants not to support the potential purchase of the fund on shares in the company, or they could be disfellowshiped.
A few years later, Bogi Nils pulled back his decision, followed by Ragnar Thor’s counsel, of course by Bua’s decision.
Nevertheless, they saw a reason for multiplying the matter in the Friday newspaper News magazine with large words about shadow management, lawbreaking, and a great need for changes in law.
There, though the blessed due had been in a recession mode and was quickly wiped out, small duves were certainly to roll a heavy casing.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the matter itself at the end.
I've been looking at the things in the law on the pension fund that are subject to this matter.
These include the interests of financial corporations and the moral standards of investment, and these aspects are detailed in the agreement of both the Value and the Social Fund of merchants, as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look only at short - term profits in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous policy, and it would not have to be looked for a long time for examples in the past, where large bank loans and cods have flown to immoral adventurers and environmental waste, with tragic consequences.
The President of Icelandair was evidently on the hail of ice when he thought to wipe out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the favor that the company has enjoyed on the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Happily, he saw and pulled it back.
The time shows whether it is sufficient to allow investments in the social fund to be considered accountable to financial corporations at the end of the period.

One of the infected did not perform a return acquis
One of the three reported Covid-19 on the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic Sea on 15 July, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Iceland, who is not habitually resident here, so he was not given clear instructions to maintain a so - called return assay after the arrival of the country and to take another show a few days after the arrival.
He got negative from his screening at the border.
“ But he is in an Icelandic community, and he is actually going to make that choice, ” says Kamilla Josepsdaughter, a medical specialist in the field of health care, and a surrogate of a clinician during his summer vacation, in a conversation with the News magazine today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the identification number and if the identification number is not registered, you are not automatically announced in the second view.”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad, rather than because of his link to the country as an Iceland, he should have used it rather than Icelandic.
But he did not realize that.
“ When the number is not recorded, you have to seek to come in the second display yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this was the right way, ” says Kamilla.
“ Thus, it is clear that we need to promote the information about this while we find some way to make an automatic preaching system even though Icelandic people do not register their identification.
Or then making it somehow more obvious who are members of the Icelandic community of the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, though, the person who came to the country was very few, although he was defined as a member of the Icelandic community, a resident of the Icelandic country.
Only six people have been sent to an affair after he was diagnosed yesterday and were all in contact with him.
They will take a sample, but two of them have shown the symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received negative results from his demonstration at the border on July 15.
Kamilla is likely to say that he was recently infected by the virus that she could not yet be diagnosed when the vision was taken over the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected in Iceland but not carrying the virus to the country.
“ It’s not quite possible to claim that this is definitely imported because it’s been a long time since he arrived in the country that he could have been exposed here, like those two who have caused a little battle in connection with the sports conventions. ”
However, she says that it is very unlikely because of the few people around here.
“ It is really very unlikely, ” says Kamilla, but he states that it cannot be ruled out until Iceland’s genetic analysis has been reassessed by the virus in man.
“ If we get a virus type that hasn’t been seen here before, it is almost certain that he carried it to the country. ”
Piper sprays and bombs against Protestants
There was a conflict between the police and the Protestants in Seattle last night.
The police used pepper sprays and undeadly hand mines, but the Protestants broke windows and set on fire.
45 Protestants were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested in many parts of the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were in support of Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one Protestant was shot to death.
As stated at the BBC, the assailant has been arrested.
In Seattle thousands met in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a building area and broke windows in the city’s courthouse.
As a result, the police claimed that the protests were upset, and there was conflict between groups of Protestants and police.
The demand for justice in Aurora, Colorado, was Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man murdered by police in August last year, the least of the Protestants.
A car drove through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of black troops came together and demanded justice for Breonnu Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman murdered by a police officer in her home in March last year.
The group was armed with firearms and joined troops at closed street conventions, where the police were responsible for the group of protesting protestors and also carrying firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where the Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white owner in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskin, football director Manchester United, doesn't want to overemphasise the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final campaign of the English election department.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea won't lose against Wolves, end Sunshine and his men to the fifth seat and then lose the Championship seat.
However, they should still hope to join the Championship Department by winning the European Division next month.
“ We haven’t reached the end.
If we get a score against Leicester, I think people will say we've now not had a bad period," said Solskin.
“ But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey, ” said Sunshirn, “for we still have a lot to do with the two teams above us. ”
Clearly, at 15 a.m. today, the nerves of people will become thinner, but Sunshirt tried to pretend that each other game was a game.
“ If you want to be part of Manchester United, you must get used to being under pressure during the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is based on the company.
We've made a great opportunity to end the season well, and now it's ours to use it," said Solskin.
“ This is not the most important game of the season; it is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important.
The end does not define our period, we have already had many hours to define this period."
“ The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed much for us, and I think that we are in better shape and much stronger spiritually than in the last season, ” said Sunshine.
65,000 infections per day
The 65,490 new virus virus was detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed from the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
The virus killed 900 people yesterday, but in the last four days there were more than 1,000 deaths per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths caused by the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
A report from CNN reports that according to the prophetic model of the U.S. Disease Control, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000, August 15, next.
Fear of the Second Walk of the Epidemic
The Spanish authorities are now trying to refrain from increasing COVID-19 spread in the country.
The Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID–19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There has been no more 24 - day reports since May, and the reports are coming at the same time as the Spanish begin to remove one of the strictest exit barriers in Europe.
The relapse led to the British authorities now obligating passengers coming from Spain to go to an epidemic when they return.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of certain states.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia, in the northeastern part of Spain, where governments have embarked on wider limits to try to step a step toward growth.
In the capital of Barselona, entertainment sites will be closed for the next two weeks and wavehouses will be closed at midnight.
Then the ban is now valid for 200 thousand inhabitants of the Segria County in the west of Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative effect on the Spanish economy, which is highly relying on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected after the epidemic.
Tui, the largest travel office in Britain, canceled all the flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
The governments in many parts of the world are said to prepare for the second wave of epidemics, but there seems to be little interest in reappearing a wide range of exit ban that has ruined the economy.
For one thing, British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has taken very bad feelings about such things, similar to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then, President Jean Castex, has said that the nation “will not survive, economically or socially, ” if again the national ban was taken.
Many government officials hope that the local resources of individual towns, cities, or areas will be sufficient to keep the virus back in the next round if it comes to it.
Five New Infections in Iceland - Three Inside
Three internal infestations were detected yesterday and two additional to the border.
That's how five people were diagnosed with a positive Covid-19 infection yesterday in Iceland.
In the public defense report, one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football convention.
He has been sent to isolation and sixteen close associations with him in an illness.
The infected was involved in the social work of a sports company in Reykjavik and is, according to the announcement, “only part of the sports team ” in the diploma.
Others who were sickened are related to man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unrecognised and full-time infectious infectious teams of state police officers.
The conventioners of the ReyCUP have followed the advice and regulations of the medical and public health care providers still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
Yet, pictures of the convention were attracted to the attention of a very close association with them to celebrate their good team on the field.
Just before 11:00 a.m. today, the conventioners published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says: “Children, please respect the rules that competitors pick up their own stuff at school.
Parents are not allowed to do so.
"Thank you for your vision of understanding."
Another infection was diagnosed yesterday, related to the infection reported in the previous day.
Says in the announcement: “Iceland’s genetic analysis has a series of the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before. ”
Infection has been developed in this case as well as when it was infected in isolation and 12 in isolation due to the infection.
The third infection discussed by a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15, 2010.
He was detected in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six close associations with him in an illness.
Two of them have already shown signs and symptoms of viral infection.
In addition, two people were detected at the border and are awaiting the results of further studies such as cross-border pathways.
Finally, the announcement states: The National Police Department and the National Medical Office are indispensing people to take care of individual protection.
If there is any doubt whether the Covid-19 virus is present, the same one is asked to take a sample at the next medical centre.
Patreksfjärd says the campsite booked about shopping weekends - directing other guests
The campsite in Patreksfird is booked for the weekend, according to the Western Building Report.
Visitors are advised to examine other accommodations.
Named in the western region of Bilda Valley, Lake Firm, Melanes in the Red Spirit, Hotel Komokalund, and Hotel Breitavik as other options in the situation.
It's time to be at Patreksfird this weekend, for as in previous years, the Shield City, the festival of Islamic documentary in town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in town.
In the field of tents, it can be expected that this year, if the weather does not make a point, DV said earlier today from a despicable prediction.
However, the worst weather in the south can be expected, and the hope for Patreks.
The web bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodations in town were already booked.
A house full of houses ponds down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free of charge at Dunhaga 18–20.
During the period, owners are looking for a building permit for improvement, but their business has been successful in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest, and most expensive areas of Reykjavik City, there is a lofty house on three floors.
On the floor of the house, there is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
Behind the house is the door of two stairways, each containing four rather beautiful apartments.
They are between 93 and 130 square meters, although most over 100.
The house has a lot of history.
It was built in 1959, including a video rent, a school room, a milk store for the Milk Commerce, a Joa gunsmith, a fish sale, and now the last graduate.
The house, for a mild word, has remembered its figs more beautiful.
The house is now under great damage, as can be seen in the accompanying images.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of the D18 ehf. are according to the company register, among others Magnús the son of Magnús and Godrún the Helga Lárus daughter.
Magnus was head of the Borging Group and defended the property fund of the Borging Society.
As part of the owned property company Payment, Steel Ships ehf.
A steel ship may be the Godrún's investment company Helga Lárus' daughter and her children.
Godrún also owns third parts of D18 ehf.
Godrún and her husband, August Gudmundur, the son of Victory, once drove the construction of a Steel ship.
D18 ev. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little or nothing been held with since them.
Neighbors say that the house’s condition has worsened ever since, though mostly in recent years.
On a Facebook site in the neighborhood, one resident says that the house “was not very lively last years. ”
This may include the fact that for a few years the owners have sought to change the house and the land.
Other neighbors say that the house has not been okay for a long time.
“ It’s a long time to do something nice about this spot and boring that it’s been attracted like this. ”
At the same time, he says that he is pissed at the owners of the house for not having driven himself into finishing it, found a common surface with the neighbors of the house, and quit this “school. ”
“Just do this in consultation with the community around so that you can hurry up and finish it.”
The “stable of law” that is prepared to refer to is the organisational process of the field that has been running at least since 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 sought permission to build a hill above the current house and behind the house, a new elevator house, and a one - floor building, plus a basement.
The building permit granted for that implementation was filed to the Environmental and Resources Committee and repealed it in which the implementation was not supported by a divisional organisation and the announcement was insufficient.
Then the city of Reykjavik began with a divisional work and finished it with an announcement in the Government News in July of last year.
That organisation was also prosecuted and repealed by the Committee in March 2020.
Thus, at that point, nearly three years had passed from the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house at the starting point.
At that time, the house had fallen down a number of times, and neighbors began to get tired.
When DV asked the neighbors into the situation and the reaction of neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some understood the purpose of the property of the house, others did not.
Others directed anger to the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but nothing necessarily had to do with anyone.
Others said the parking lots a fighter, but neighbors have new unused parking spaces of Dunhaga 18 to 20 under their vehicle.
One prosecutor said:
“ It’s amazing that we have to go through the process three times.
It's like Reykjavík City couldn't read."
Today, the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
Reminded the city’s tremendous government and the noble expectations of the owner and the many years of the work of the present one.
When a journalist in Dunhaga 18 had a garden, he could see an open door and a garbage pile.
Playstation computer and recent TV were in the middle of another garbage on earth — victims of a Icelandic summer shower.
The opening was in the old office of the college executive and there a number of cats of the lizard smell to judge.
Clearly, someone has been nestling in one corner, but no one is visible.
Staples of sofas and beds and a few boards of geographic pages, which were undoubtedly to become a book, noticed.
At the same time, the stairs of the apartment were open and alive in both of them.
A journalist was so lucky to meet the people of one of them.
There the Romanians were cooking potato dishes for dinner and invited a journalist.
The Romanians work for Ztrongforce's staff hire.
They have been there for some time and simulate DV’s sources that the company has paid nothing for the household except heat and electricity.
Because of the state of the house, it does not seem advisable to collect rents.
From postal positions in the front door of the house, it is clear that there have been a number of foreign workers in the past.
The business of employees has not become part of the Covid-19 state, since the contraction of travel has led to contractions in the construction sector, and these two industries have been the most difficult to make use of the service of employees.
Nevertheless, in Dunhaga 18 homes seemed to have enough to do, and after a long day of the rain, the work defects and mischiefs were hung out.
It should be noted that despite the miserable state of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a reporter said goodbye to the boys in Romania, the sarcasm suddenly became clear: In the best place in Reykjavik, 1,500 square meters of property is devastated.
Owners want to change the house for improvement, and neighbors want to improve the state but argue about the definition of "better".
The city's organisational field is then at the start, the victims of endless appeal routes and complaints in the organisational process and the resolution of the Committee on Environment and Resources.
In the house, such bedside workers, perhaps those who are going to improve the situation, live when the Iceland stops arguing.
The article was originally published in DV, July 17th.
In an overweight response to a coronary virus epidemic
Britain’s Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will give 10 million pounds in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on rapid invitations, after he severely weakened, partly because of his weight.
It says that tomorrow, on Monday, Johnson introduces the campaign entitled Better Health, but during the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bicycle rides for their clients to overweight, and they will also be attacked by the increase of bicycle paths.
Then, according to British media sources, advertisements on television will be banned before 21 a.m.
“CoVID-19 has raised us towards short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must spend time on becoming healthier, more effective and eating healthier food,” said the government spokesman.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was put into intensive care when he was infected with the crown virus in spring, and it is partly because of his weight he is considered to have been so severely ill.
Women Better Introducing Changes
She said that the new Constitution was the greatest step that the nation could take toward greater distribution of power, transparency, and against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“ We need to change gears a little now, and who is better able to lead such changes than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
It's women," said Helga.
“ Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s association.
To stick together and be together in conducting changes
So now's only our turn to lead these changes."
She said that she was a little worried about the emphasis on Iceland that is “the best in the world ” in both gender equality and human rights.
“ Then we are not as ready to see what we need to do.
Like the Germans, they are very conscious of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we come from, know the story, and listen.
Listen to the voices of border groups.
We don't live with the same rules all here," said Helga.
In many ways, she said that women are in good terms in Iceland, but she added that, as in many other places, Iceland has a very male value.
She said that politics turned to photography of their own interests, authority, and authority, which were the forces that maintained discrimination in all communities.
“ Women have now established this group and come together and are just getting a little irritated about the fact that the General Assembly is going to ignore this national contribution since 2012, ” she said.
“ It is these female values that we are thinking about.
Because of human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we all sit at the same table," she said and added that the above values are the basic values of the new Constitution.
“ We are a very rich country of natural estate, and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can divide differently," said Helga.
“ It is ridiculous that there is a natural law that women’s jobs are always less paid.
It's ridiculous that flying girls and nurses have to stand forever in a battle just to get a decent salary."
The signature list for the new Constitution can be signed here through electronic Iceland.
Trying to rob a walking passager in the center of town
A man was arrested in the center of the city last night after he threatened walking passengers and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Årborg, where two were arrested for the case.
The police then stopped the motorcycle driver in the hills where its driver was at a speed of 146 km, with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn this night, and more than 80 cases were recorded in a police diary from yesterday to five this morning.
There was a particularly high level of noise notifications on the part of a party.
On Saturday night, 11 noisey gatherings were announced, and the police’s diary was very popular.
Tonight, however, 22 noises on the police table were disrupted.
Six were stored in a cell last night.
In the rivertown, the police were called in last night when the parties fired fireworks.
However, they had already escaped when a police officer came to the park.
Then nine drivers were stopped for drunkenness and or drug driving.
Four were arrested for fighting in the city of the city last night, one of whom was stored in a prison cell.
Two were then taken to an emergency reception after they fell on their faces, one in the city center, and the other in the western town.
One was transferred to an accident department after he was injured in jumping on trampoline in Copavogi.
Besides, police officers stopped the driver who pulled a wheelchair at Kjalarnesi yesterday.
According to the police diary, the wheelchair’s wheeling equipment was “very bad ” and remained.

The house in which Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his training is now rented on the page Airbnb.
The next night in the house is about the weekends of merchants.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry, Normandie, France.

The house has three bedrooms, two bedrooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If someone intends to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
Based on the page Airbnb, it is next free in a week, on Sunday of the merchant weekend, so it might be ideal for some merchants on a vacation to go to book the painter’s house.
The two nights of the shopping weekend only cost $964, or just over $130,000, as the News magazine reaches next.
Twenty in an epidemic, and some of them have shown symptoms of the disease caused by the crown virus
In the last three days, five have been diagnosed with the corona virus in the country and most of the infected have not been associated.
Thousands of people have become sick because of this, and some of them have started to show the symptoms of the virus.
Three were detected with the chronovirus inland yesterday and two at the border range.
According to a medical expert, the growing number of internal infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading wider into society.
“ There has been a series of differentials from the previous internal infection, and it is a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, so we have no special reason to think that it has been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Camilla Victory Josephsdaughter, an expert in the field of health care in the field of the medical office.
Most of them have been infected with individuals from abroad.
More samples will be carried out in the next few days than some who were in contact with the infected have shown the symptoms of the crown virus.
“ There is no influenza at present, and it is less like other respiratory infections, ” said Kamilla, “so we can be rather liberal about doing these tests on individuals who during the time of influenza would have found reason to do something else first. ”
Infection is mostly complete, but it is not impossible that more people have to go to an epidemic.
Two infected persons were detected after attending sports events.
Has it raised questions whether such events are advisable?
As long as people follow standards and regulations, the public communications manager says that it is very slow.
Kamilla says virtually impossible that the infected were infected at the sports conventions.
“ If there are no more isolation from these individuals after being around them at these sports conventions, we can claim that our convention health care has worked.
But it is not revealed," said Kamilla.
The work of the Public Protection Department is under constant review.
“ We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or limitations, ” said Kamilla.
In over a week, there will be a wide range of limitations to a thousand people.
This new situation could affect the loss of mind.
See Elisha Vidar's menu
Elisha, a daughter of Vedar, is a prominent football player playing with Val.
She is also a master student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a food expert.
It needs much energy for the day’s work and usually takes time to cook good and nourishing food.
My usual day starts by meeting up to eight," says Elisha.
“ After work, I go to the store to prepare my dinner before I get my girl to the theatre at three o’clock. ”
Elisha finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter early in the theatrical school.
“ It’s good to have time with her before I go to the second part.
After practice, it's good to come home and just have to warm up.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one part to empty our mind."
Elisha does not follow a diet.
Since she is finishing a masterpiece in nutritional science, she knows well how to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family, and exercise.
“ What suits me is eating a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates, and fat.
However, I find it the most important thing to have a healthy relationship with food, not to classify food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It's all right to eat everything, just not all of a sudden and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“ I find a certain meditation in standing in the kitchen to cook and so get a lot of it.
I have to say that my confidence is in my kitchen, and I really believe that I am a fine cook."
Breakfast: Havers, chia-seeds, hamp seeds, salt, a little citric juice, put in almond milk overnight.
The top of this meal then by what is available each time.
Usually it is banana and jumping mouse & chapters.
I'm a great coffee woman.
Intermediate: Unbelievable differences, but fruits or vegetables, flat cakes, clean clouds with banana and mouse, bread with a leg, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon up from a box if that happens.
Dinner: I often prepare for all kinds of food - rich salads from what is in the fridge, quinos or barley, falafels, rock salad, superb vegetables with a good dressing is a little what I’m working on.
If the organization goes completely out of hand (which often happens) then the egg machine at work has saved me quite often, and then there are 2 breadbits with butter, cheese and cooked eggs, no more.
Intermediate: Get me some carbohydrate for practice, a bread with a belly, a grain of breakfast, or fruit.
Dinner: Fish are very often choosing in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Fight between police and Protestant in Seattle
The city authorities of Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of rebellion following mass protests in the city.
Yesterday, the police seized a flame bomb and pepper spray to try to eradicate a large area that the Protestants took over and stretched across many buildings in the vicinity of the city’s congress.
On Twitter, the police announced that at least 11 Protestants were arrested and that there was an investigation on damage done at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The city and police authorities say that the Protestants stoned the police with stones, bottles, shell bombs and other loose bombs and were taken to a hospital where he was injured.
However, the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
They were encouraged to show a unity of Protestants in Portland, Oregon, where there has been repeated conflicts between Protestants and heavy - armed federal police forces.
As in more cities in the United States, people gather under the marks of Black Lives Matter, George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on 25 May, protests systematic racism in the American community and demands improvement.
Not revoked until after spelling
Still, it is not possible that their flight mate Icelandair, who will take effect at the next month’s convention, will be revoked.
Iceland Airmaid's Airmaid Company, on behalf of Icelandair's Flightmaid, ends at noon tomorrow.
Godlaug Liney Johann’s daughter, chairman of the Society, says assured that Icelandair will not decide on the termination until the conclusion of the vote.
“ This clearly hangs together, ” says Godlaug Liney.
“ There have been no resignations, and this must be done so that the machines can be made human.
Of course, people are anxious to find out if they will have work after the monthly convention."
The prize is for a contract signed a week ago, in the late 19th of July.
It is assumed to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract previously agreed by the pilots in the vote.
On July 17, Iceland’s Aeronautical Association’s Government and Confidential Council agreed to announce Icelandair’s Icelandair’s Icelandair’s Iceland’s Iceland’s Iceland’s Iceland’s Iceland’s Iceland’s Iceland’s Iceland’s Iceland’s Iceland’s Iceland’s Iceland’s Iceland’s Iceland’s Iceland’s Inefalogue approved it in a vote.
Never came to her, but this was decided after Icelandair’s decision to stop talking to the Airmaid Society, to quit all his flight mates, and to seek for agreements with another class association.
Then the company’s pilots were to take on the job of security officers on board temporarily.
Ask her how she thinks that the vote will take place, Godlaug Liney says that it is difficult to say.
“ After Icelandair’s mission, people are in wounds when all the company’s airlines were dismissed and announced that they would be negotiated with another class community.
Now it will show if it affects," she says.
At the end of April, 940 pilots worked for Icelandair, who had 900 of them, some 95%, quit.
Their resignation period is different, for those who have the shortest lifetime he is three months and therefore ends at the July Convention.
There are about 90% of Icelanda's pilots in this group.
What will take place if the contract is not agreed?
“ Then we wish to continue our conversation with our congregators.
With this contract, we're meeting Icelandair's demands.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the pilots seem to have gone too far."
End of the vote on a cooperative contract and Icelandair presents another quarter of the year tomorrow.
The flying lady's vote for a new contract will end at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's record for another quarter will also be published tomorrow, but the provisional result indicates that the company's income has fallen by 85 percent from the same period in the previous year.
The electric vote on the airline agreement between the Iceland Airlines and the Icelandair Association began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27th, at 12 p.m.
Those who may vote for the contract are Icelandair staff who pay social costs to the Airmaid Society.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new contract on Sunday, July 19, but Friday before, Icelandair had terminated the discussion with the company after the pilots collaborated the previous agreement in the vote at the beginning of July.
Then Icelandair had told all the airlines and airlines on Friday, but they were pulled back after a new contract was signed.
According to a new contract, pilots need to fly five more hours a month for the same basic salary.
The contract is valid for the year 2025, where pilots and pilots have agreed how long to fly on one watch.
The contract was introduced to F.F.I.A. at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday, describing many pilots who were discussed by a press office for their dissatisfaction over the contract.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the agreement would have to be agreed to keep the FIFA alive.
Icelandair’s record for another quarter will be presented tomorrow, but the EBIT Society’s, its financial and tax business, according to the preliminary excise rate, has a negative amount of $100 to 110 million U.S.A., or about $15 billion.
Icelandair sent a preliminary bill last Wednesday, where it said that the company’s income amounted to some $60 million in a quarter or $8.3 billion.
At the end of the quarter, about $154 million have been paid by hand with an equivalent of $21 billion.
Icelandair is also aiming to offer the company’s shares in August.
Icelandair is aiming to conclude agreements with fifteen creditors, governments and Boeing aircraft manufacturers by the end of the month before the partial bid.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“ A new virus simply means that it has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been scrambling here in the country, ” says Már Kristjánsson, a head doctor of the Disease Department of the National Hospital, about the reports that “new viruses ” have been detected in this country.
Three internal diseases were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in the social work of a sports community at the Rey Cup football convention, but the origin of the infection was unfounded and infectious.
A person who came to the country on 15 July was also diagnosed with the symptoms of COVID-19.
Then, yesterday, a virus related infection reported in the previous day and after a series analysis in the Icelandic gene analysis was detected “a new type of virus that has not been detected in the past”.
Infection has been completed in connection with this infection.
Ant says that it is not a new virus, but it is the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new SARS-CoV-2 corona virus.
It is more appropriate to speak of a new variant of that virus than of a new type of virus.
Asking what it means and if it could tell you something about the beginning of another wave of epidemic, Mum says that as if it were a single case, it could be no more.
“ However, if there are cases in the country that do not have the same genotype as this particular variant, they could be drawn to that conclusion [about a second wave], but it is inappropriate to date, ” explains Már.
Happiness in the Hot Cup
Is the secret to Iceland's happiness hidden in the hot pots?
BBC's diplomas lead to the likes in a fun video that sheds light on the land's swimming pool and hotpot culture.
The Icelandic bathing system is unique worldwide and claims that nowhere in the world is the same number of bathing places per population.
The natural heat is its foundation, but also its tradition for sinking.
In 1940, children were legally taught, but older citizens are also diligent in using hot water to improve their health.
Dizziness is described as a solid part of the country’s general welfare.
In the pot, everyone's equal, regardless of class and position.
We’re free to use the mobile phones to talk personally about homes and spaces or to enjoy the gentle power of the water: meditating and loading the batteries of the soul and body.
At the brat to pick up a hundred days in elections
A hundred days are until the Americans vote and choose a president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-election, but he has a brake to pick up.
Joe Biden, the prospective candidate of the Democratic Party, has a high precedence for Trump nationally, taking into account surveys.
According to the AP reporter’s recent survey, the number of Americans estimates that the nation is in the wrong way.
Likewise, Trump’s reaction to a world pandemic of the new crown virus is very impopulation, and more Americans than before think that the President had a poor economic attitude.
In more detail, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right path.
32 percent claim to support Trump’s response to the epidemic, and 48 percent say that he has maintained economic conditions well.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average of FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 per cent nationally followed by Trump 41.9 per cent.
Trump himself has tried to divert the attention from his performance of the pathway to Biden, promoting so-called cultural disputes and pronounce policy to turn to law and order.
However, Biden’s offer puts forth a lot of effort to keep Trump’s attention, counting a great probability of winning if the election is actually about how Trump has been doing in the past four years.
The opposers of Trump seem also to come down to the members of the Republican Party and fear that the Democrats could even reach the majority of the United States Senate, which so far has been very threatening.
Politico reported in the days that the succession of groups and candidates was similar, and that is now the Republican Party would receive its greatest deterioration for decades.
The suburban has been particularly bad in the 2016 parliamentary elections, and now it seems that this development will continue.
Trump has tried in recent days to scare the residents of suburbs to follow him, including by saying that becoming President Biden, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and promote racial conflict.
Among other things, Trump has deliberated a regulation since the time of Barack Obama in the White House, designed to increase the diversity of suburbs.
Then he urged “wifes ” of the U.S. suburbs to read an article from the former New York Assistant State Manager, who claimed that Biden would destroy the suburbs of the United States and took Trump for it.
“ Bide will ruin your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!" said the president.
The population of the U.S. suburbs is a growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half the voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received most votes from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
The surveys have shown that despite the fact that Trump secured a small majority in the suburbs in 2016, his follow-up there has been substantially detracted.
Although there are differences between the surveys, Biden has recommended a fifteen-percenty proximity of Trump in the past.
Regis Philbin is dead.
American televisionist Regis Philbin is dead, 88 years old.
Philbin served as an actor, a director, introducer, and singer for about six decades.

Will the Olympic Fire be the light at the end of the hallways?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, events that have only led to world wars, the president of the International Committee of the Olympics said that the Olympic Fire would be famous “the light at the end of the hallways, ” referring there to the probable world - based corona virus.
There is another year to be prepared, and Japan’s authorities add to the cost of delay.
Everyone, though, keeps his head at great risk.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the scene of the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese representatives were genuinely excited.
They cried and laughed, because Tokyo had applied to keep the plays in 2016, but then they bowed down to RIO in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan would show themselves in the world’s attention.
The games were to take place on July 24 to August 9, which has been postponed for a year and will begin on July 23, 2021 and end on August 8.
If they fail to keep the games, if the crown virus still threatens too much, the games will be stopped.
Yet, no one would like to think that to the end.
The Olympic Games are not a regular sports contest.
There is nothing saved, the show should always be wonderful and endeavor to top the last game.
The selection of the city for Olympic Games is based on the assessment by the election committee of the cities' presentations.
The more magnificent the presentation — the more prominent it is.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to maintain the Olympic Games in 2016, or over $20 billion.
The second time, when the games were applied for in 2020, $75 million, about $10 billion, were put in the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo had been given the games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent $30 billion on the project.
However, the amount is just a drop in the sea, based on the cost of building an Olympic village, the stadium, and in general, to strengthen the country’s invasion to handle such conventions, prepare it, and keep the plays themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which should have been running these days but have been postponed for one year because of the crown virus, would have cost $1.6 billion.
However, a report by a government auditor in Japan published at the end of the last year showed that the cost is almost double that number.
Although the cost of postponing the games will probably not be fully assessed, it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
Thus, total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could run between $15 and $30 billion.
The figures are so high that all the tax revenues of the Iceland were only worth about half the Olympic Games, given the lowest possible cost.
Olympic games are an event of the degree of size that they have often become the subject of economists, who try to examine numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
In short, many seem to have concluded that the effects of the Olympic Games are less favourable to the economy of the cities that hold them.
Short-term effects are some, for example, increasing the number of jobs very much for a short time, but for a long time, cities often live with debt gaps and horrible operating costs of low-used manoeuvres.
RIO in Brazil has a serious debt on account of the games in 2016 and has been in trouble with the maintenance of all the major athletes built for the games.
Numbers have been examined after the London Games in 2012, which have shown that only 10 percent of those who received jobs related to the Olympic Games in the city were out of work before.
This means that there were only little new jobs.
In general, cities have not been particularly comfortable financially with maintaining Olympic Games because of the cost of the manpower built for the plays.
However, the benefits are often thought to be the result of an increase in the traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, which, however, is very uncertain about the 2021 games.
It is also unclear whether all the audiences who usually attend the games will have to be accepted.
The main issue, though, is the honor of the cities, but it is difficult to value money.
In spite of the enormous cost, the joy that the games bring is not the nature of the value of it.
But although the show is often magnificent and there is no saving, it is of course not just money.
It's the sports heroes in the foreground.
For some performers, it is only a pleasure to postpone the games.
For example, the Australian 5 - triangle woman and a gold - prize winner in her article on the Olympic Games page Chloe Esposito is a casolette and would have been far from a good fun in summer, but hopes to be in a race form for the 2021 games.
So it is among the sportsmen who are just rather pleased with the postponement for understandable reasons.
For the athletes who planned to quit after the games this year, if they were held at the right time, the postponement of the games in some cases means that they quit the race before the games take place.
Just don’t trust your body to go through another year of strict exercises.
Few athletes found themselves as thoroughly in the hearts of the audience at the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 as Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his country of America recently to discuss the Olympic Games.
She plans to play 2021, but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top of the games next year, so she will be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a gymnastic woman in the first row.
“ This is a sensitive subject, ” says Biles, but she smiles to another interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee, asking whether she intends to make the 2021 games as long as she did in the Rio 2016.
“ I simply don’t know if I’ll still be on top after another year of practice, ” says Biles.
She has said that her body cannot endure the pressures of gymnastics much longer.
Nevertheless, she is exercising zealously for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop rehearsaling suddenly when the pandemic was at the highest and the classroom was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles, as for others, while all athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find ways to keep herself in shape as others.
Certainly, the basic form is a little better than in most people.
“ We have a rigid plan now.
It was hard to start rehearsaling first after the classroom opened.
We started slowly, but we are fully resumed, and I will gradually increase my exercises as the year ends.
Of course, we do not know exactly what these games will be like, or whether they will be held, but we still practice as long as they will be, that’s all we can do.
I've been working too hard to leave the sport now," says Biles.
With it, as with others, doubts or perhaps more consciousness that the situation may occur that the games will not be held at all in 2021, but in 2021.
Foretelling, though, is hopeless.
In July 2021, no one can know how the world pandemic situation of the crown virus will be, and nothing else to do than prepare for the Olympic Games as they are held in a year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnels.
Deferred Marriage for a Pandemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding for the crown virus.
She was supposed to marry the former Bachelorette competitor Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about right now, ” said the actor in a conversation with People.
“ We really want to get married sometime and have the wedding of our dreams, and we have all those who love us.
However, we decided to put it on time and focus on what is important right now, and it helps us to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look more at world affairs than the wedding affairs these days.
There's a lot going on and we're supposed to focus our attention on what's happening in the world."
