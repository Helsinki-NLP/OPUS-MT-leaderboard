Kate's cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not angry.
There's no doubt about who's being elected.
He got hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep myself motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read the story about the ring-trilogin?

I would do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom set me up.
Tom helps.
One morning he saw a pretty girl.
This tree is not even close to being the highest in the socks.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up.
My father's well.
We can save a lot of lives.
If you don't have any money, you'll have to make it without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.

Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a couple of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should've done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy grabbed the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mosquito bite.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of someone?
I'd like to talk to Tom about a battle between four eyes.
He will fall for the temptation.
The TV's not working.
I can explain that.
She's acting like a child.
How does it look?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all of this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but at least you can accept that there are people who have other opinions than you?
Tom dropped the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you done now?
She couldn't think of seeing him again.
Even during my worktime, I give in secret for my Internet dependence.
I never thought it would be that hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get down to town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Could you freeze it down?
Tom blinked with the full lights.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone says they did.
There's no one here named like that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come and sit down.
It's got to do.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My motor saw is broken.
You think she's pretty, don't you?
He lived a simple life.
This is gonna take years.
I misspelled the word.
I don't like this book.
A octopus has ten arms.
She didn't come before two.
I am.
That was very good.
Come talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
Never had I seen such a peaceful vision.
Tom's fast.

Sadly, Tom failed.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She attached a photo.
The walls in the old house weren't straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the wheel to the right.
I'm at the wind.

I can do it myself!
Don't worry.
She paid seven percent interest on the loan.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to fire you.
Can I think about it?
When did you see Tom?
It's not important!
Strange things happened on her birthday.
Does anyone here speak Russian?
I drove the car.
I've got great news.

Do you know the rules?
I've let the tailor sew up a new suit for me.
I thought it was a joke.
Tom and I, we both miss you very much.
Please.
Tell me why she's crying.
It's an old manuscript.
You wouldn't enjoy it.
I'm talking to the principal.
I opened the door.
Tom didn't pretend to hear Mary crying his name.
I decided never to do that again.
What did they think?
He wiped the sweat from his face.
Wash your face.
When I got home, I discovered that I had lost my wallet.

Here comes Tom now.
If it were just that simple.
I'm horrible.
I'm going to study English this afternoon.
There's almost no milk left in the glass.

You have to pay back your debts.
It's okay with me.
