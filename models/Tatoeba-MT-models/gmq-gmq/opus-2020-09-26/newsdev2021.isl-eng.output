Biden leads viewing studies in three key states
With only 100 days of election, Joe Biden, a candidate for Democrats, enjoys a predecessor in three important fluctuations.
CNN reports today that Biden was over to Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, the Biden is measured by 51% to 46% of the president's escort.
In Arizona, the status is 49%–45% of the Biden and in Michigan is headed for superior Biden, because there he leads with 12 points, 52%–40%.
To win the elections in November, in 100 days, Trump has to turn all these states, and actually more.
Trump is now experiencing a crown - viral epidemic that is taught by his country to a greater extent and says that most of the questions raised by the United States have been unresponsive, or very unreliable at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has caused bad opposition from protests and revolts that arose at the death of George Floyd.
Thinks Trump and his government have reacted badly or wrongly to those matters.
To crown Trump's problem, he is now subject to more serious criticism for ordering federal police to break off protests in cities where city or government are Democrats.
Has it created a tremendous wolf - suffering among the city’s inhabitants, and the wrath is spread to other Americans?
The images of federal police to pluck the Protestants into unmarked cars have not helped the United States.
Attracted the ad The Lincoln Project exactly attention to this, but it can be seen here below.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with a very small vote.
Trump actually won a very many states with a small vote and won the elections with a minority of votes.
For example, Michigan won with only 10.704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% of the population.
Nearly all the polls that political reporters say are showing the same conclusion, Biden is excellent.
A new survey of CNN in Arizona shows that Biden is now preceded by the scan.
The same is the case with CNN and Quinnipiac University surveys about Florida.
Even Fox News, who leaned well to the right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published surveys of the same material in its media.
The President's last hope, according to the findings of the questionnaires, is that Trump could have the hope of returning to important places in the fluctuation state if the campaign focuses on economics.
The United States’ economies took a heavy hit after the Covid-19 epidemic, but the voters do not seem to be linking the economic shock to the crown virus epidemic.
That is, the vast majority of voters seem to blame Trump for having failed to respond to the chronavirus epidemic, but trust him better to deal with the economic shock that occurs at this time.
However, Trump has failed to direct the discussion in the election campaign.
After the revolts that have burned almost continuously since the news of the video, in which four policemen killed George Floyd, Trump tried to direct the discussion against law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order became his unique words.
It now seems to have failed completely, as previously said.
As the polls lean more on Trump, more and more Republicans are more likely to abandon Trump and declare support for either Biden, or someone else, which is Biden, without mentioning him specifically.
This is because in the United States, they are choosing many votes on the same preference.
Thus, the voter can simply mark the second group in the presidential voting part of the voter’s vote, acting alone as a vote for all other candidates of that class on the vote.
In this way, the candidates of the Republican Party are tempting to cut off Trump’s seamless forces and to succeed in the elections.
Dakar’s Olympics Delayed to 2026
The youth’s Olympic Games were to be held in Dakar next year, which has now been postponed to 2026 because of the crown virus epidemic since the International Olympic Committee and Senegal agreed to do so.
However, the postponement of the first Olympic Games to be held in Africa is a shock for many young athletes.
Volunteer arrested for the fire in Nantes
A volunteer in the church in Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with a fire that destroyed the church.
Le Monde notes that the suspect, a refugee from Rwanda who served as a church overseer, admitted to having set the fire on fire.
The man’s lawyer says in conversation with another media that the man cares for his actions.
Among those destroyed in the fire was an organ from the 17th century and historically depicted windows of the church.
The 39 - year - old volunteer who has not been named was arrested shortly after the burn of July 18, which was then released.
He was then returned to the report last night and then put into custody.
“No way out of this ”
I am welcome at the home of Baltasar and Christjana Samper in Copavogi.
The reason for my visit is the new art show of Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, which will be opened on August 1, in the Lada of Little Kambi on Snow Falls.
This is the first time the fathers show up together.
I am brought down to Baltasar’s workplace, where I have a magnificent painting.
Large and drowsy pictures of chicks in the past, but also of flying creatures; eagles on one, birds on the other.
From the lab, the house is expelled.
“ We had a horse here with us that bit the grass, ” says Baltasar.
“ The horse works much better than a lawnmower on these hills and hills we have. ”
Mireya, with us, and Baltasar, tells us how her work rhymes with the works here.
“Introductions, a mixture of paperwork and jewelry.
They're all very white and in contrast to what Dad's doing, because I'm working on the light and stuff," she says.
“ It's been a year since this idea came up.
Then there were certain jobs that I was working on and would have wanted to show there, but they were trapped in Tokyo from Covid.
When my father started painting, and I saw where he was going, I re-thinked my part," says Mireya, but Baltasar’s works have strong pronouncements in Icelandic legends about female chicks and ponds.
“ When I realized that my father was doing this painting with the ladies, I thought it was ideal to make jewelry that is related to them, ” says Mireya, the jewelry that she works with Winning No Bearnson’s golden maker in the store Sign.
“ Then I’ll make a insertion from the jewelry. ”
Last year, Mireya attended the 72 artists of the Academy of Sense at Snowfellsnesi, including in the Lada of Little Kambi, and found the building fascinating.
“ This is a new space, an old load that has just been made up, ” says Mireya, who spoke to Baldvina, a Swiss - daughter artist who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar set up a show together.
“ She wanted us both to show, and then we thought:
“ Why not?
That's a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in 1938 in Spain and attended the University of Arts in Barcelona before his worldwide trip to study art and study.
He came here in Iceland in 1961 and was fascinated by land and nation.
Shortly afterward, he came back to his wife, Christina, and has lived here since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is a prominent artist, has held a dozen private shows, and shows with Christjana in many parts of the world.
He is the most famous for his large wall pictures, such as a wall decoration in the Familiar Church and Fresh in the West Side Church.
“ What affects what I do is the bitterness of Iceland and no other place, ” says Baltasar.
“ This low sun and these shadows are stretching and stretching.
As soon as I came here, I thought, “Wow, here you can work. ”
Mireya is the oldest of the children of Christjana and Baltasar, born in 1964.
“ There was one thing I knew, and it was quite clear that I wasn’t going to become an artist, ” she asked if she wanted to walk in her parents ’ footsteps.
“ So I went to high school for maturity and physics and did everything I could to get away with it.
Then I realized that I was on the run.
Then you just have to give up," says Mireya and laughs.
Like her father, she has shown many places around the world.
A lot in Japan, to picture.
All the children of Baltazzar and Christjana have walked the list road.
“I call it a virus, ” says Mireya.
"There was no way out of this."
Counts Icelandair has been in a grey area when the airlines were terminated
Icelandair believes that he was in a grey area when the company broke up all the airlines in the middle of a nuclear.
Then he says that he asked for a law that prevents firemen from entering an apartment house to be considered after the fire on the Brother’s Trial.
On July 17, Icelandair was advised to terminate all the 38 pilots who worked for the company while the Corelian of the Airmaid Society was still on the level of a State Conference.
The divisions were aware of whether Icelandair had been allowed to resort to these resignations and were prepared to settle the matter for a social trial.
But this never ended with flying girls and Icelandair, after the resignation, together more than 24 hours.
On the other hand, Mr. Ásmund Einar Dadason, Minister for Social Affairs, says that in his view, Icelandair’s decision was in a grey area and went to the right of employees.
“ My opinion is that this is a right to protect payers.
When you're in conversation, when you're inside a negotiator, it's not an option to go this way.
It is quite clear to me that this would not have stood.
I think it's quite clear, in my mind, that men had come into a gray area where this touched," says Ásmundur.
He will thus not predict that other companies go the same way as Icelandair.
“ You can also now see dangerous discussions about the fact that it is just normal to jump this system up to reduce this right, and that is why I am totally opposed. ”
This morning, on the Bombisand, Ásmundur was also asked about the government’s reaction to the fire of a brother’s city course at the end of June, where three were killed.
The Minister now states the study of the matter on the board of the House and the Agency of Manufacturing, to which he has directed recommendations.
“ It is in the law today that the fire will not enter an apartment.
I've asked the House and Manufacturing Agency to examine specifically whether there is a reason to make any legal changes.
I'm ready to make the legal changes needed to reduce the likelihood that this might happen again," says Ásmundur Einar.
You can listen to the interview with Ásmund as a whole in the player below.
United States said increased pressure on North Stream 2 - RT Business News
According to Welt am Sonntag, the U.S. government has made further attempts to force European companies to abandon the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is led by Russia.
According to the newspaper, the U.S. government officials have contacted European entrepreneurs to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to 12 officials should have held at least two network meetings with representatives of the companies in the last days.
Those who witnessed the talk said that the Americans had “friendly ” emphasised that the United States wanted to prevent North Stream 2 from becoming a reality.
“I think this is a very, very serious threat, ” said one desert to the German press.
These threats are in line with the statement by Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Minister, last week when he warned that companies involved in the project would be best to “get out now ” or be at risk of punishment according to 232 parts of the notorious law of Countering America’s Adversaries through the Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy crisis Gazprom, which supervises the development of the project, five European companies are involved.
This is the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-Holland company Royal Dutch Shell, as well as Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with Welt am Sonntag, a representative of the latter company said that the attempts made by the United States to undermine “important infrastructures” were clearly involved in the European Republic.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Representative Congress agreed to a change in the law on land defenses designed to extend the United States penalties against companies involved in the installation of the Russian North Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the carriers of the law-based broadcast, the options can be addressed to companies that provide or provide ships, guarantees, porting positions or interconnection services for such ships, as well as those offering a testimony for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and officials have repeatedly expressed their disapproval of the US's efforts to intervene in European energy by applying penalties against North Stream 2, and some of them have even called for Brussel to act as a countermeasurer.
Moscow officials have also critically criticized the Washington operation and called it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, Dmitrij Peskov, spokesman of the presidential office, said that Russia would set up a new plan on how the project will be completed if the presidents of Washington were to carry out the new penalties.
Preparing further transfers of official agencies to the country
The Minister of Social Affairs and Children intends to move more public institutions to the country next.
In the autumn, the Board of Bodies and Manufacturers will be moved north to the Sheep Crown in which the Minister’s decision has been decided, but experts in the department have previously declared that they do not intend to move north.
Asmund Einar Dadason, Minister for Social Affairs and Children, said in the Bombisandi of the Bay this morning that it would be important for the countryside to be transferred to the public institutions.
Hence, a great variety of value creations.
“ It is nationally important, we are trying to build everything around the country.
Employment building, monetary building, whether in travel services, agriculture, industry, some natural utilization, and this type of work as public works, they are very supportive for that structure," says Ásmundur.
"Creating increased diversity, providing better support for this resource use and the creation of the national currency."
The Ásmunds decision to move the fire-removal fields of the Housing and Manufacturing Agency has been severely criticised by its employees and the National Association of Firecare and Health Care Transporters.
Six people who have special knowledge of fire and work in the department are all living in the capital area, and none of them intend to move their habitats to a sheep’s hook.
“ I think it is quite clear that there is political differences in how hard this should be.
My view is, and has always been, that we should take radical measures to better distribute the official duties," says Ásmundur.
“ We see that our neighboring nations, Northmen, and Danir have been doing this successfully. ”
He is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more spread in the public institutions around the country.
“I think there is a need to make further political decisions on the transfer of public services to the country, just as I was doing with the House and Manufacturing Institute. ”
He takes an example of the transfer of the Food Agency to Selfos, Iceland’s Land meters to Akraness, and unemployment insurance at Skagaststrand.
“ It’s a workplace on Skagast Beach today that matters to that community.
I think we should take further steps into this being."
“ I am preparing further steps in this way.
More transportation."
Fifty of them arrested in Seattle
The systematic racism and the decision of Presidents of the United States to send federal police forces into towns to settle up riots were protested in many parts of the day.
In fifteen decades of Protestants were arrested in Seattle.
The Seattle police used flammable bombs and pepper sprays in massive protests last night, which the police have described as revolts.
21 policemen were injured, and at least 45 Protestants were arrested.
Two months later, after a police officer killed George Floyd, there were protests against systematic racism.
The Protestants were led to a coherence of the Protestants in Portland.
There has been repeated conflicts between police and Protestants after the U.S. President sent U.S. police forces that have driven unmarked cars to unpleasant authorities.
Thousands met in Portland during the weekend, using the police of tear gases and rubber coils when they were struck between them and Protestants.

Moore, known for his participation in the The Real Housewives of Atlanta, had her first child 47 years after technology fertilisation and called her daughter the miraculous child.
“Waiting almost all my life for a baby, ” Moore said to People.

Moore realized that she was running out of time when she was 40 years old.
“ I didn’t want to have a baby alone.
I didn't want to be a single mother.

Moore went into a difficult emperor’s canal and took much longer than a conventional emperor’s cultivation.
“ I call her the miraculous baby, ” Moore said during the interview, “because it was a child that everyone said was virtually no probability for me to have. ”
Feeds arrested in Mizoram with value of 15.4 million rupis of heroin
The value of the heroin on the domestic market was about 15.5 million rupees and was smuggled from Myanmar, according to the police
A man and his son were arrested with 1.9 kilograms of heroin in the Hnahthial district of Mizoram, near the border of Myanmar, followed by police on Sunday.
The value of the heroin on the domestic market was about 15.5 million rupees, which, according to the police, was smuggled from Myanmar.
Duhkima (62) and his son Remthangpuia (33) were arrested with drugs on Friday evening in the village of Ngharchhip, said the police.
They also lost about 280 grams of heroin, the value of some 1.5 million rupees when they swim over, on their escape from the police, as reported by the office.
According to police information, this is considered to be one of the highest levels of heroin held in the state.
The defendants were brought to trial under the appropriate law on drugs and hallucinations (NDPS) of 1985.

The Assam rifle team recently captured 25 cars of loaded Bethelnets smuggled from Myanmar, worth about 40 million rupis.
A Physician ran 35 miles [35 km] with a mask
The British doctor Tom Lawton ran 35 miles [35 km] with a face mask to show that oxygen saturation did not decrease with facial masks.
Lawton is a doctor at the Bradford Royal Hospital. He's been working there during the pandemic.
To deny the theory of oxygen saturation and to encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run to work and back with a mask.
Before leaving, he instituted a collection at GoFundMe for the Trusell Trust, who provides food supplies in Bradford and in Britain.
“ I am a great supporter of everything that keeps us safe.
That is why I have been shocked by the wrong information that has been transmitted between people about the reduction of the oxygen saturation of the face masks," said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had been competing in three times before, but during his pandemic, he had been slowing down.
On Monday, he ran the 35 miles.
“I never took off the mask (no food or drink) and the oxygen saturation was steady 98% every time I looked, ” wrote Lawton on Twitter.

Gottlieb warns us that the unprecedented spread of the crown virus in society makes it “very difficult ” for schools to open in the fall
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the United States Food and Drug Monitor, warned on Sunday that it would be “very difficult ” for school districts to open during a new year of study if the crown virus spreads without delay within these communities.
“ I believe that local school authorities need to examine the extent to which the distribution is within society.
If the virus spreads freely in society, it will be very difficult to open in that condition," said Gottlieb in "Face the Nation".
Since the autumn tour should begin in the next few weeks, Trump’s government had encouraged the school authorities to open their schools to students and offer training at schools five days a week.
However, these attempts by President Trump and the Ministry of Education, Betsy DeVos, come a week after Trump warned that the crown virus epidemic would probably “be worse before he recovers ” and confirmed that school districts in places where the worst situation might have to be delayed for a few weeks.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, the centres of disease protection gave instructions on how safest it was to open schools for students.
The instructions include the distance between people's loyalty, students and staff from schools, the recommendation to use facial protection and the division of students into defined groups to reduce infectious pathways.
However, the centres of disease protection did not provide guidelines for school managers about when to close schools if the number of chronovirus infections increases, as Gottlieb says has been “unhappy. ”
“ When this uncertainty and precise guidance have not been given on how schools will be opened, ” he says, “I think more parents will be careful. ”
“ For this reason, I consider it very important to have accurate information on the precise criteria that the Disease Protection Centers did not provide in their instructions. ”
Gottlieb told school districts to consider the proportion of positive infections in society, local spread, and test ability when decisions are made about whether to keep schools open or to switch the alpha into teaching on the Internet.
If between 5 and 10 % of the analysis gives a positive conclusion, “the problem is going to be difficult”, but over 10% is “the threshold when considering carefully whether to close the school examinations. ”
“ This is a sign that the epidemic has reached its footsteps in society, ” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make parts of Florida, which are the center of the crown virus epidemic in the United States, difficult to open up for schooling in the next month.
Choron virus infection has increased to more than 30 countries and Colombia, but the central center of the epidemic is in the sunbelt called the south coast of the United States.
Gottlieb, however, said that there was evidence that there was a slowing down in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
Yet, although Gottlieb said that there was “a clear sign ” of slowing down in some states in the sunbelt, other countries, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indiana, and Illinois, have become “heated in the coals. ”
Many governors have set rules that oblige people to use masks in public spaces and have stopped the reopening of targets to counteract the spread of the crown virus.
Gottlieb said that governments should consider closing bars, limiting the number of people at restaurants, closing movie houses and other places that offer entertainment indoors, and setting rules on masking use to overcome the epidemic, which enable governments to avoid resumption of the strict limitations set at the beginning of the March epidemic.
In addition to the use of masks by various states, various companies have obliged people to use face defenses.
McDonald's quickbit's is the latest company to make the use of face defense a duty and therefore add to a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and others who have set their own rules on masking.
Gottlieb said that he assumed that more companies would take up a masking duty with him, especially as the danger is considered to be high.
“ If we can really control the passage when winter comes until we receive vaccine or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical process of this disease, we can do it with masks, that is relatively simple, something that we can all do but that does not directly change our lives and allows us to keep things that are very important to us, such as keeping some companies open and bringing the kids back to school, ” he says.
Despite the fact that Donald Trump did not wish to make mask use throughout the country last week, he urged the Americans to use face defenses and said at the White House press conference that “they are influenced. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: “It’s a news to expect ”
The members of the Crystal Palace were shook for the summer when Roy Hodgson, director of the Society, declared that the prosecutor, Wilf Zaha, wanted to leave the company.
The elephant race has played at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now seems to be leaving, but it has been made up with a team such as Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, it will be found whether a team in that quality class is still willing to pay a high sum for him, especially in the financial uncertainty of the sport this summer, after a period where Zaha scored four limits and made five supports for the Palace team that caused some disappointment.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that “the news is expected ” about Zaha’s possible departure after confirming that the prosecutor had“ made it clear ” that he would see his future elsewhere than in the company.
There are still three years left of the parisher’s agreement with the Palace, and last year, the Society indicated that 100 million bucks would be needed to bring him out.
Hodgson’s team ended the period with seven losses in order and a drawback during the last day of the period, which led to the fall of the team to 14 seats.
Zaha found the net mask only once from mid - December to the end of the season with a long - shot loss against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for sale last summer when he tried to get out of the company, but no offer was made to tempt the Palace to sell.
Zaha changed the agent in January, apparently to increase the chance of getting out of the company, and in the next few weeks he will be undoubtedly preceded by social change.
Zaha is the player who played most of the minutes in the English election department for the Palace during the period and was the only player of the team under the age of 28 who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much reconstruction of the team could be necessary to attack with the money available to the player.
Organ Hannah: The Texas Coron Virus State is faced with a high risk of disasters in “double plagues ”
Weather reports have prophesied “coastal floods ” in southern Texas after the two - to - land hurricane of Hanna, resulting in heavy rainfalls and winds up to 40 meters per second.
When reaching the beach on Saturday, he was classified as a first-stage storm (the bottom point of five-point scales) and has now been moved down into a tropical storm, but rain could still amount to 150-300 mm on Sunday, and the wind could reach 26 metres per second.
In some areas rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including Cameron County at the border of Mexico.
Hannah was the first hurricane in the Atlantic Sea in 2020, and weather scholar Chris Birchfield advised people to be on guard: “This is not nearly over yet, and we are still expecting disasters. ”
For the past few weeks, Texas has struggled with a great increase in the presence of corona virus viruses.
The governor Greg Abbott published a disaster announcement for 23 counties on the road to the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All hurricanes are a tremendous challenge.
This challenge is complicated and even harder where the hurricane goes through a region that has become worse because of COVID-19," Greg said.
The hurricane first came to land at 5:00 a.m. on Saturday, 24 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, about 210 miles [210 km] south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far away, in the eastern Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were out of power on Saturday night.
Corpus Christi’s emergency services set up gardens near street fronts to enable them to be used in case of flooding across the streets.
U.S. president Donald Trump said in a hurry that the government was watching the design and hurricane Douglas, headed towards Hawaii in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the coast of Corpus Christi, said that the storm approaching had increased her anxiety over the pandemic.
This 67 - year - old woman had mostly stayed at home because of health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It’s almost like a double punch for us.
I think a lot of people are getting nervous.
We'll get through this.
They're all good and strong, and they're together."
Hearing of a flowering sail in Southern Europe
At some ends, the peasant weather has been exceptionally successful in the South.
Most of them have had the first hit, the second slaughter has begun in many places, and then some are expected to reach the third slice at the end of the summer.
The weather has been playing with southern farmers, like other inhabitants of the countryside this summer, and it does not spoil the peasants.
So hearing has gone well.
The winner of Augustus' son, a cow farmer in Birtingaholt, in the Craneman's Ground, and the entrepreneur in the harvest is happy and happy.
“ Yes, it has just been brilliant, I think farmers must just be steep, it's been fine and it's been very good weather in the last six months.
The ears are very good end the harvest good, and the quality of the hays fine whole," says Sigurd.
Winning says that it is growing, especially in the country of cows, that they are haying in flat pits or outdoors, which have been very well given, but it is the longest thing to do in the roll hearing.
“ It’s a lively, yes, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable now for the last two weeks or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good, and it’s so comfortable to deal with it.
It's much more, it's less stress and it can be stored until the morning, sometimes what could be done today, so it's brilliant comfortable.
But does Victory think that some farmers will strike three times?
“ Yes, I could believe that, the first ones.
We started on June 17, it could be that those who were the first have to take something three times."
Primary solution in the wolves - How to prevent injuries
The Canteen Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English department, is an enormous fast player.
His opposers have taken hold of him to make sure he does not get past them.
This has caused his shoulder to fall out several times, but now the wolves have brought a solution to the problem.
The Sun reports this.
In Wolves' game against Crystal Palace, medical officers could see anointing something on Traore's shoulders.
“ This is something we had to do to protect Traoré, ” says a source of Wolves, but what was going on was a child oil.
“ Making him slimier makes it more difficult for defenders to catch him, and so we can prevent further injuries. ”
Traore's shoulders first fell off when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has fallen out of the team four times, now last against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News of Prince Harry of England: A friend of the Duke of Sussex protests claims in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
Stott said in a conversation with Sky News that the content of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was in no different content of the gossip papers, the only difference was that the book was inlined.
The ex - soldier wants to have more seas directed to the positive things that he and his wife have done, such as their charity work.
Stott said: “I don’t think what is said there is anything different from what we read in the gossip magazines, except now only in a book. ”
“ There is a historian who tells, yet there is no certainty that this is from them. ”
“ I just think this is another attack on them, just like the gossips that persecute them. ”
“ I realize that they are on the scene and people want to know what they are doing, but I wish that they would be more concerned about all the good things they have done and their charity work, rather than their personal affairs. ”
“ Of course, they never get away from it, because of their position. ”
The support of the Duke and the Duke of Sussex overshadowed other members of the royal family, according to an expert in the history of the royal family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family failed to benefit Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
She added, however, that the order of power within the royal family was firmly established, but that it could not be controlled what raised public interest.
She also said: “The fact is that everything they did to support the queen was inclined to obscure other members of the royal family, and this was considered to be a problem. ”
"They are very popular."
“ They had less weddings than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding. ”
“ But although Harry’s and Meghan’s weddings were smaller in shape than with Will and Katrine, news transmission was as much, because of the great interest of the world in the couple. ”
Donald Trump admits that he often regrets his rausing on Twitter
Donald Trump has acknowledged that he often regrets his posts on Twitter that promote war.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the president of the United States told him that his undesirable reimbursement of Twitter records — some of which have contained material from white racialism — would cause him the most trouble.
When journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he regretted his posts, Trump replied: “Oftly, too often.
It was so in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very big.
You put it on your desk and then you came back the next day and said, "Oh, I'm glad I didn't send this," right?
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We send it out immediately, we feel great, and then you start getting calls — “Did you really say this? ”
I say, “What is wrong with this? ” and you find out something.
Last month, Trump caused great anger after reappearing a record (divided material from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages area in Florida, where an elderly couple called "White power!" or "the power of whites".
And in 2017, Trump reaffirmed three entries directed against Muslims, published by Jayda Fransen, the leader of the right extreme group of Great Britain First.
The president told Portnoy that the reimbursements that had put him in the most trouble
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t study it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what it says on your helmet, which is a little bit and you don’t grow it, sometimes – I’ve found that it’s almost always the restoration that causes you trouble. ”
The president often shares praise to himself, his opposers and conspiracy teachings with 80 million of his followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter helps him get through the so - called “false news ” of television shows and newspapers, which he says are transparent by untruth.
But the President’s own lies have often come under the microscope, and now the Twitter records of Trump are misleading.
GPS system may be insecure
Many countries work to develop a different location technology than the GPS system.
Engineeringlektor says that there may be a reason to worry about the safety of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been renewing life.
GPS's tracking us at every footstep.
We use it when flying, sailing, and driving, in land measurements, in industry, and in leisure.
Most people don’t think that it is a military device owned by the U.S. Army, which first opened it for general use in the 1980 ’ s.
GPS devices use coordinates from satellite to 20,000 miles [20,000 km] above the ground, so conditions in nature have little effect on it.
“ But it’s very easy to disturb her.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these marks," says Samundur E. Thorsteinsson, professor of engineering at Iceland University and expert on risk management and security communications.
He also says that it is easy to send a misplace, for example in warfare.
“ The GPS system is owned by the U.S. Defense Department.
They have assured the public that the system is in place at all times.
But certainly they can turn this off if it fell into the head of a very special president to make such a thing, he could probably do it," says Semundur.
Hence, many governments have taken into consideration other systems and location techniques.
Both the Russians and the Chinese operate their own satellite systems, and the European Union is firing the Galileo location system from the stocks.
“Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may be more accurate and naturally controlled by the European Union.
Then it is not one government who will rule it completely, but many," says Semundur.
But many people are also looking back to the old loran technology.
It's based on radio waves and was used from the '60s until GPS technology took over.
The Lóran marks are sent on very long waves from sent down on the ground.
“ It is, then, a new version of the Loran system called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, that people are seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a precaution, because it is a little different laws to disrupt it, much more difficult than disrupting the satellite system, ” says Seamundur.
However, it is probably safest to have access to most location systems.
Experienced Senator Vern Buchanan died by the crown virus
“ Gary was a professional in the middle of his finger and a loyal servant of the public, ” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched so many lives and was loved and glorified by those who knew him.
I will never forget how refreshing he was, the sense of humor, and the joy he received from helping others."
Buchanan’s office published a statement earlier in the month that Tibbetts had no recent contact with others at the office.
Tibbetts, who served outside the office, had served for Buchanan since 2011.
Florida has reported 414.511 cases since the beginning of the pandemic, which are more than 411.200 cases in New York City, according to the health authorities.
Public health data show that hospitals have increased by 79% since the U.S. National Festival, July 4.
The data also show that at least 50 intensive care departments in Florida reached levels on Saturday.
“ We informed him that this could have an effect, ” DeSantis said in June.
“At the same time, police work and making remedies could have the opposite effect. ”
A Flight From Hornafore to Cape Town
Turk doves, roses, ring doves, cross-naves, glitters, and weeping are among the birds that have flourished here to the country this summer.
On the web of the Southeastern Bird Surveillance Station, short news about the complications, where they have been seen, and sometimes their gender can be seen every day.
They are many bird - interested people in Iceland.
To illustrate this, the number of people who like the Facebook page is Icelandic birds.
The members of the group are about 14,600.
It shares pictures of birds and makes it clear that Iceland is rich in good photographers who have the patience needed to make birds.
The brynje of Brynjelf's son is one of them.
Binni, as he is called, is a staff member of the bird checking station at the Southeastern and Southeastern Natural Office, and watches well the bird life in that area.
He speaks beautifully of these animals that enrich the life of Iceland and play an important role there, and it doesn’t matter whether the bird is a large and large bird of robbery or a small sparrow.
In 2005, the bird inspection station was established on the birthday of Half-dead Björnson in the Shrines of the Desert, with the goal of airing and continuing his marvelous natural research since 1940.
“ When he was 13 years old, he began to collect information about birds, ” says Brynjelves in a conversation with the nucleus.
“ We at the bird checkpoint are not doing exactly what Half-death did, but are building on his data by counting and marking birds. ”
A peasant and a population scientist, born on March 14, 1927, was halfdáned.
He wrote a number of scientific articles about plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, almost 90 years old.
Half - dead and his siblings in the Shrines were interested in many of their acquaintances with Icelandic nature.
Among these are Björn Gísli Eagleson, “the employee ” of the Bird Surveillance Station.
Björn grew up on the Trial Valley in a Southern Corps and was richly eager to his neighbor, Half-dead in the Shrines.
What, though, is it really that the Southeast bird Surveillance Station does?
Each year, about 20 March, the Bird Surveillance Station sets up a special bird’s ant in a lonely wooden area within the Harn of Hornfird.
There, standard markings are made on the birds that come into the nets.
The nets are taken down around May 10 when the warp time begins.
The nets are up every day, at least from about six o’clock in the morning to midday.
And they have to visit every hour.
The birds that come in are marked, measured, and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a reporter wonders.
“ Yes, we share it, me and Bæsi.
Since we now have to work for ourselves, this can be a lot of puzzle, but somehow we'll be able to do this," says Brynjelves.
The nets are then rebuilt in the period from August 1 to November 10 — every day the weather permits.
Between guarding the nets and the periods that they are not up there, pancreas and bear mark the crowns, the clouds, and various moobirds where they reach them.
In addition, they take on special assignments.
One of these projects is done in cooperation with the Iceland National Institute of Natural Science and is about collecting birds.
“ The woodsmith jumps on the birds at their winter stations and then takes them to land in the spring.
This happens shortly before they leave, so these ticks are not large when they come to Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find another host when he needs it."
But there's plenty of titanium.
Asking how the birds in the Southeastern Land did it this summer, Brynjeve says that the birds seem to be successful — where she is over her head.
“ The key to the warp here is at Hala, a Southern squad, where everything is going well.
On the other hand, there is nothing left to be found at the river Jackel, where there was a huge garment a few years ago."
He says that a few years ago, there were over 1,000 pairs of worms, but now they can be counted on one’s fingers.
“ When we look at moo and waving birds, I feel that in the last few years, what you feel of them has been reduced.
But, of course, there's always a change between years."
According to Brynjelf, what can explain this great change is most likely about the supply of food.
"Oh, it's all about food."
In that case, man’s work may also have to say about the survival of birds and other animals.
But some birds seem to have a pretty good time in the Southeastern country this summer.
“ One of the positive things that I think is to choose is to increase again after great lowness, ” says Brynjelves, “but during the last few years and decades, the swamps have shredded. ”
From sparrows, it is reported that like last year, the marijuana seems to be going well in its garbage.
Forest twigs and ducks had decreased slightly, but a jewel says it will not appear until in the fall how this summer proved to be them.
But let's turn to the compulsions.
Often they draw great attention, especially if they are very few and even colorful.
These two interesting features relate to one of the most popular complications of the summer: the Rose Star.
“ Otherwise, it has been relatively quiet in the summer of the compulsions, ” says Brynjelves, but mentions that in the country there is now a crying tube and then a ring pigeon has been seen and is now laying down here.
When panoramics and bears get in touch with complications, they also mark them, just as other birds do.
Signs are international, and they are practiced worldwide.
The meanings, such as the winter stations of the birds, the location and routes of the birds, can be made available.
“ It is even possible to see how long they are on a flight, ” points Brownut.
This information is useful in many ways, for example in the case of epidemics such as birds.
“ Knowledge is always being increased. ”
If someone in the world finds a bird marked by the Southeastern Bird Surveillance Station, the information is sent to the Iceland National Institute.
“ We have recovered from Cape Town, South Africa.
There we found a crown that we had marked.
One crown from us was found later in the United States."
One bird is a brynja, especially the mind, and it is the cloud.
“ The forest is our bird, ” he says, pointing out that the Bird Surveillance Station and the Southeastern National Agency are the task of monitoring its survival — which has become quite depressed and now he is on the voyage.
It is difficult to claim what caused the decay, but one of the theories is that the swamp has made itself a top of the sea that was previously disposed of by fishing boats and into the sea, but it is now becoming much more effective and affecting the cloud.
Are you in the best place in the country to watch birds?
“ You don’t naturally get me to say no, ” says a jewel laughing, adding: “Since we are also chasing for a compulsive bird, we must probably go further. ”
Surely, though, the Southeastern country is special when it comes to bird life.
“ This area is like a drag in the land from Europe, and then the birds spread out of here.
Being here looking at birds and birds is very interesting, but there is less to be found of varpbirds than in many other parts of the country.
It's not far from the feast to the glacier, so the area that this is suitable for the observation of birds."
But Brynjelves have a favorite bird?
He thinks about it for a little while before he answers.
I think the question is difficult.
“ I have found nine of the ten that have been seen on the land, ” he finally answers.
“ I now enjoy taking pictures of horse tales.
It's always fun to find birds that haven't been seen in this country before or are rare, so I don't talk about finding a new species for Europe."
But they've both your companions and Bæssi.
If you want to monitor more closely the work of Binna and Bjässa at the Southeastern Bird Surveillance Station, you can monitor their work on Facebook and on the birds web.is
Saudi Arabia – the Sun coast of the future? No alcohol or bikini
In recent years, the tourist industry has grown tremendously in many parts of the world, and now the authorities in Saudi Arabia want their share of the cake.
The government is presuming to spend about a hundred billion dollars of dollars on a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian reports this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that Iceland and I should get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol is not available and women are not allowed to soluble in bikinium.
But how, then, should tourists be lured to this strictly religious Islamic land?
For example, this is to be done by building a new city of white beaches, a moon (made by humans), tractor rental cars, and robots serving people.
The Guardian says it's Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's crown prince who wants to invest.
Of course, the money will be collected from the land’s oil supply.
The crown prince says that it is not a question of women’s freedom to cover shoulders and knees in public places but acknowledges that it is not a simple matter to create a tourist paradise in the country because it is too hot when the sun is high and it cannot be trusted in wind cooling.
But then you may wonder if it will not also reduce the interest of future tourists if they are unable to buy alcohol.
Mr Francois Bozize, formerly cast by the Presidential Court of the Central African Republic, reports of presidential proposition
On Saturday, the former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been cast off, announced that he would be present in the presidential elections in December, despite the fact that the United Nations is carrying out his penalties and that his criminal offence against mankind had been issued.
He announced his offer in a talk in front of a large group of supporters at his class council, Kwa na Kwa (“work, only work”), in the capital of Bangui.
This 73 - year - old former general and general was deprived of power in 2013 in the revolt of the Alliance to the greatest Muslim rebels from the north, which cast the majority of the nation to Christianity into a violent civil war and a severe and long - lasting human war.
“The country needs a man with experience, peace, and conviction, ” said Bozize in a speech that was critical of the current President’s term of office, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
In 2003, Bozize first ruled after the predecessor and served as president for 10 years before fleeing the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for a criminal offence against mankind and for encouraging genocide, but he has not been arrested since he returned from exile in the late year.
It is not clear how the arrest order or foreign penalties affect his offer.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to remedy the retaliation that was initiated in 2014 for the purpose of supporting armed Christian groups of Anti-balaka.
Touadera today runs the country with the support of the UN’s vast peacekeeping system, which counts over 13,000 military and police officers.
He was elected in 2016, and he is expected to prepare for a different period of time, but his offer has not been confirmed.
The first round of the elections will be December 27th.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace treaty with 14 armed groups who generally claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violence has declined, but there are still bloody incidents that are mostly caused by resource conflicts, but the majority of this diamond country is not under government control.
Violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
The situation of Gareth Bale in Real Madrid is “inconsistent for all, ” says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, the center of Real Madrid, says the status of Gareth Bale of the Spanish team is “unacceptable to all. ”
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team and he took little part in the LaLiga celebration of Los Blancos, and now this summer is the plight that the player intends to stay still and let his contract run out, but the company hopes that he will disappear.
“There is no way to avoid becoming unacceptable to everyone, ” said Kroos on Lauschangriff Endlich was my sport.
“ He was not bought to play as little as he is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the company last summer and that the company actually said "yes" but then "no" later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about that.
When asked if the situation had adversely affected the atmosphere of Real, Kroos said: “Not as much as possible.
I've known him for six years, and we've worked important things together."
Chinese give Reykjane’s city 2,000 face masks to support the fight against the crown virus
The Chinese ambassador, Jin Zhijian, delivered two thousand face masks to the mayor of Reykjane’s city last week.
The occasion was the visit of the Mayor to the Chinese Embassy on July 22, last.
Weak news first reported.
The mayor’s visit was to repay the Chinese ambassador’s visit to Reykjane, where he visited the councilhouse and met with the mayor.
Reports that there was a discussion of promoting the cooperation of friends between Reykjane City and the city of Xianyang, but the towns began their cooperation between 2014.
The gift, 2,000 face masks, is rooted in this vicinity cooperation, but the city’s authorities in Xianyang wanted to give masks and thus support the fight against the crown virus epidemic.
News reports that the masks will be used in the sensitive institutions and offices of Reykjane City for both employees and other visitors.
In addition to the flags of Iceland and the People’s Republic of China, a picture is included in the face mask box, which says “Ber is behind each other, except for seeing a brother. ”
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculates by lowering the salary
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from the Champion of Iceland KR, next month and claim to be interested by friends in Danish 1st Division.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and has become an Iceland champion with both Val and KR.
However, this 27 - year - old attendant claims to be missing Denmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania, the daughter of Jacob.
The Danan agreement with the KR applies to the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish company had to negotiate with the KR for a purchase price to get it in August, before the new season begins in Denmark.
Otherwise Thomsen would have to wait until winter to get to Denmark.
“ Yes, I know the Danish branches will start again at the end of August.
It means, of course, that I had to break my contract with KR-ings, but I have told them that I miss Denmark, and they have full understanding of it," said Thomsen to bold.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with a trainer named Rúnar Kristinsson, who had shown full understanding of his position, and Thomsen said that he did not think that the price would be a major problem.
“ I have also had conversations with two members of the first department after that department had finished and had known where they would end.
There has already been a little interest in the coming periods, so it may well be that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic department stops," said Thomsen but added that there are not many companions in Denmark who could buy up his contract with the KR.
“ It is not clear now, but it has been an interest.
I also need to find the best chance for me and my girlfriend, who's from Iceland, and who's coming with me.
It depends on a few things," said Thomsen, and said, "The first of all, look to the harbours of the merchants."
Thomsen said KR-ings don't have to worry that he wouldn't give himself all the time in exercises and games, although he missed Denmark.
“ KR knows what it gets from me, and it is that I do things 100 percent.
I can totally overlook the fact that I miss Denmark when I'm in practice or playing games," said Thomsen, who clearly says that he's going to lower his wages by leaving the Iceland champions in the next department of Denmark.
“ I’ll probably have to lower my wages only because of the crown virus crises, which seem to have devastated the Danish companions a little more than the Icelandic.
But I am also studying, and one solution may be that a partner provided me with a job.
The majority of the members of Section 1 have an agreement with sponsors.
I'm learning sports management through the playback organization, and I'm finishing the bachelor degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been in the first team of KR in two games in the Pepsi Max squad during this season, but in five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games for the last year and scored seven limits.
The KR is equal to the scores of the Pepsi Max squad, but the team is meeting KA at Akureyri today.
Arrest the crown virus on the bus when a driver gets into a hot fight about face masks
The video shows passengers and drivers aboard an Arriva bus in Liverpool.
The driver may explain to a woman that it is not his job to tell passengers to use a mask.
The driver said: “It’s not my job to tell everyone who steps up in the car to use a mask. ”
Regarding the incident, a Witness said: “A man and an older woman began to get involved with her, and there was a lot of quarrel. ”
“ The driver had to leave his seat and came to ask what was going on, and he told one woman that she wasn’t even using the mask properly. ”
“ This woman then ran out of the carriage and said she was going to report the incident. ”
A spokesman, Arriva, said: “The security of our clients and of our employees is our priority.
“Our clients are already obliged to use masks when using public transport (except for the use of masks).”
“Clarified instructions and meanings for customers regarding this, and all other distance rules are on board the buses, the social media and our website.”
Since June 15, a masking duty has been valid in public transportation.
More than 16.3 cases of COVID-19 have been identified worldwide.
More than 6500,000 have died.
Worldwide, more than 9,90,000 people have recovered from the crown virus.
Most cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls after Hollywood hires people with disabilities more often in their roles
The actor is taking part in a new effort to increase the participation of people with a disabilities in the recreation sector.
The campaign is taking place at the same time as 30 years have passed since the U.S. law on people's rights with disabilities, which occurs on Sunday.

“This is why it is so important to hire an appropriate actor in an appropriate role. ”
Spencer spoke of the effect she experienced when she watched the show “Good Times. ”
The programs shown in CBS between 1974 and 1979 were made by Norman Lear, and they made the first comedy shows showing two parents of African origin.
An organization against hunger push Yoho to the side after an incident in the Senate
WASHINGTON (AP) – Regardless of a Christian organization who wanted to end the hunger, on Saturday they said that they had waited for the congressman Ted Yoho to resign from the government of the organizations, and that after what they called “attack ” on the congressman Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez, he had done so.
Ocasio-Cortez, Senator of Democrata, New York, accused Yoho, Senator of the Republic of Florida, of using a lowly and male reproach when he rebuked Yoho when they met at the stairs of the Senate last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed that the wording was as she described it.
Bread for the World stated that the government of the organizations met Yoho on Friday and sought to resign to “justify our commitment to standing with women and skin - dark people, inland and worldwide, leading us to the world with increased involvement of all races and increased justice. ”
On the Web site Bread for the World, their “co - Christian voice ” pressures the Congress and governments to bring an end to the hunger in the country and worldwide.
“When Bread for the World is independent of a Christian organization that has the objective of reducing hunger and poverty by trusting public policies, the organization maintains the respect, dignity, and concern that Jesus asks us to show when dealing with people in positions of power, wherever it is in the political spectrum, ” says the Declaration.
“ Our assessment reflects recent activities and the words of Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, not the moral requirements for our government members. ”
During the story, Yoho’s spokesman had not responded to an e - mail offer.
In an amazing speech at the House of Congress last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez dramatically spoke of the incident and directed her words against what she called a man - class teaching that “accepts violence and violent speech against women. ”
More than a dozen of her colleagues agreed with her saying that the incident was an example of overly common men’s behavior.
Yoho described the incident as a short discussion on policy and said that “no one had been bothered, mobbed, or attacked. ”
He said that he regrets showing “happy attitude. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in his first period as a prosperous congressman and has received both praise and reproach for her cleanness.
The 65-year-old Yoho is one of the most consolidating congressmen and will sit on a sanctuary after his fourth term.

Players Real Madrid are exempted from the rules on the application
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to come to England in their second game with Manchester City, in Europe's Championship, without having to go to a two-week diploma.
The British government has decided that tourists from Spain have to go to a two - week epidemic in order to block the spread of the crown virus.
However, there are exceptions, as in the case of high - level competition teams.
This confirmed the Department of Sports athletes at Sky Sports.
The Ministry says that the persons exempted from the rules will only be in restricted areas at the doors of the closed.
This applies to sports stars, judges, trainers, medical teams, and media.
The Madrids can therefore meet Manchester City on August 7 without having to stay long in England, but they are 2 to 1 in the dual after losing in Santiago Bernabea on February 26.
The winning team will proceed to the 8-point final in Portugal.
Continental rains and the land of the weekends of traders
From the news of overwhelming hotels and tent areas, in the smallest south, it is clear that Iceland has been diligent in traveling inland this summer.
Have those who have landed at the same time been very lucky with the weather and the weather dealers of DV in one case that the summer was just plainly said, so far, at least.
But now it is a commercial weekend that has been the greatest weekend of the year.
However, compared with other weekends, it is not clear how it will be this year, since events that have led to a large number of people in the usual year have not been held.
For example, there is a nation’s celebration.
The weather will, of course, play a major role, but now it looks like a rainfall in the whole country, but especially in the south and southwest.
The weatherroom predicts the rainfall from Thursday evening and at least Saturday evening.
For example, long - term prophecies are not sacred truth here in the northern Atlantic Ocean and are likely to change.
In his prediction on his weather tissue, Bliku, the weather scholar knocked on the son of Einar Sveinbjörn, saying that the weekend of trade is declining.
Says he: A low - temperature in the sky, with the cold belonging to it, too often reaching the surface, leads to a low temperature from the southwest, when warmer air is approaching, only with wind and rainfall.
Of course, a warmer air that is “fucking ” in the north too.
Ones publishes his prophecies in support of it and says: “A small waves from America flow to the east and with it a summer - warm air.
As it approaches, it “blooms ” in the form of lowering air pressure and considerate summers. ”
The big prediction, the European calculator to the left on the map, and the United States GFS predictions to the right are quite in agreement with this development.
Knowing the humility goes over late on Thursday and early on Friday with stormy A and raining on most of the country.
The downtown of approximately 985 hPa is followed.
This time, on Saturday and even Sunday, there's a rather warm air in the North and Eastern countries.
However, it may be inspiring.

Followed an actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
“I was in love with her as you get such youth shots, ” says Birna Kidn Björn’s daughter of Mariska Hargitay, the principal actress Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so obsessed with the actress that she came to the scene and waited for her for hours just to say hi.
When Birna Kidn Björn daughter, owner of the Pink Iceland traveling office, like many Icelendings, looked at the Law and Order tension program: Special Victims Unit from the ages, she collapsed to the main actress of Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her meetings and the actor in the series Love Story at Channel 1.
When Birna was a teenager herself, at the age of many people who began to develop violent love shots, she did not experience it as her peers did, for she was struggling to suppress her own feelings.
She pretended to be interested in boys ’ bands and young delaying heart cramps from movies, but she did not.
“ I was cutting out pop papers and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that sometimes it is said that when people come out of the closet, they go through a late puberty season.
“ We spend our teenage years suppressing these teenage motives, these shots, and stuff.
I think it was one of the things that drew me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just in love with her."
When she was in New York a few years ago, the actress ran on the wire.
One of her best friends, Erling Frykt Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie in that city and gave Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helga Godjóns son, to assist in the shooting.
“ We were working in 30 bands and spend a lot of time with strangers.
This is a naturally intimate atmosphere when you spend so long a day together, so it was spoken of everything and nothing."
One day, Birna is a great fan of Mariska.
One of the women in the band says his friend knows the actress because he was on the footage of the show.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and regularly ask her new friend how her friend likes to work with the actor, and if Birna can see her.
“ She tells me to stop. She doesn’t know if she can let it happen, ” says Birna.
When the movie is finally finished, the group will bowl and Birna will try to convince the woman for the last time to try to get the meeting around.
“ She had had a few glasses and said that she would just make it. ”
A few days later, Birna sends a message to her wife and asks if something is happening.
The woman is not responding, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning she wakes up with a long - term message.
“ I look at the phone and scream over me.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up with the screams, and I say, "I have to take a shower, and I have to make myself fine and go to town."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actors, and the law and order were present at a hotel at Times Square.
“ I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, good luck to you, ” says the message, and Birna dresses quickly, asking in the reception where the roofs go and take the lift up to the 45th floor where the group is gathered.
Birna sets up and waits until a woman in her staff comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if she can help.
“ I say I'm looking for Jason and asked the wife to tell him that Birna from Iceland was here. ”
When the friend finally arrives, he looks surprised at Bearna and asks how she got all the way to the place and was supposed to be a strict security guard.
Birna explains that she just took the elevator and asked to meet Mariska.
“ Yes, I don’t know.
Sit here," says the friend and Birna.
Aside her, an extra player sits in the shows and they start talking.
“ I say to him, ‘ I am a fan, but you, ’ ” says Birna.
"I played it like it was the most natural thing in the world."
It's time, and Birna's waiting.
The actors appear regularly when they take a break, take a talk, and Birna look around and look for Mariska, which is nowhere visible.
Finally, the friend tells her he's sorry to leave.
Birna asks him to get in the hands of another employee, and she did not intend to go anywhere immediately.
It is surprising that the friend accepts it and reaches another employee.
“ He brings one of his friends and says, ‘ This is the woman from Iceland who really wants to see Mariska. ’ ”
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend will be running to Birna.
“ He says: ‘ Hurry.
These are unusual situations today, there are journalists with her, so she won't stop.
She's going the straight way to the car with them, so you have to take a chance and go downstairs and find her wheelchair.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry."
“ Then I look right, and I lose my face ” Birna vomits off and take the elevator down to Times Square.
There it finds about forty wheelchairs, some marked and some not.
However, Mariska’s wheelchair does not find it, and then desperately she begins to be squeezed.
“ I feel the bows pouring over me because I had spent half a day on this, but I thought so well, I tried.
That was fun."
Badly, Birna is going back to the hotel, where she sees through the window the camera team watches herself with pity, but she realizes that Birna did not succeed.
Birna accepts fate and it starts raining.
“ I go under a shelter to cover myself for the rain.
Then I look right and I lose my face."
Only Mariska Hargitay was in her panty suit, and Birna was well - known — but Birna was hardly able to move by emotion.
“ I look at my body and my hands, and now you have to move.
Now you have to go towards her."
Birna does so and urges herself to dick in the shoulder of the actress.
“ She looks at me, and I can hardly say anything.
But I'll just say hello, "Birna thinks.
“ I say I'm from Iceland and a great fan.
She says, "It's so nice to meet you."
The conversation did not go much further, for Mariska’s car is here and it is whispered.
Mariska turns to Birna and says: “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you. ”
Birna pronounces the idol, watches the car drive away and then breaks down.
“ I call Erling and Gunna, and they didn’t think it would have worked.
But I was crying of excitement and joy.
I say, 'Yes, I'll meet her. 'You'll have to meet me now.
Then we poured out water and tequila," says Birna.
She will not regret anything even though she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ It is like this once in a lifetime, to sacrifice such time and energy to make such things happen.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Birna Kidn Björn's daughter in the series Love Story at Channel 1.
The police don't spread the virus.
There is no reason to worry that the crown virus can be transmitted by the police’s alcohol talks.
This is what a police officer at the police department in the capital area says in a conversation with a member of the United States.
There have been indications from people who are concerned about the use of the same mouthpiece for all drivers when the police are taking up, setting up on a roadway, and letting all who are going through the road blow.
The police, however, say the most sanitary hygiene.
“ It’s not really a special mouthpiece, ” says a police officer, “but we recommend cups that people blow into. ”
“Some people want to lay their lips on this, but we guide people to keep a little distance, up to a dozen centimetres. ”
Asking if it's sufficiently distant, a police officer says so.
If a sample is positive, the police will use it at a different level.
He has a mouthpiece, which comes from a sealed plastic bag and is used only once.
Abdominal distension: Among other things, anís can be absorbed to reduce pain
The relationship to depression is not a coincidence.
Subjects suffering from bowel inflammation, a disease characterised by abdominal pain, cramps, thumbs, wind passage, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to a worsening of the symptoms of anxiety and depression in the United States (ADAA).
“ This is because the colon is partly controlled by the nervous system that responds to stress, ” explains ADAA.
If the skin does not decrease, there may be an intolerance to food.
A Judge tries to stop a decision to release children from the custody of immigrants
In his decision on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee canceled the future time limit by saying that the importing and customs authorities in the United States do not have to release children unless it is possible to do so in any of the three ways described in its previous decree.
However, Gee also stressed the obligation of the importing and customs authorities to release children without undue delay in its decree.
The three routes Gee proposed are to release families held by immigrants and customs authorities, put children into the hands of a responsible person, or release families by a federal decision.
Shalyn Fluharty, head of the agency Proyecto Dilley, who provides families in the legal service, condemned the decision and said that she put it in the hands of the migrant and customs authorities to decide whether to keep children in custody.
“The main point is that children are kept incarcerated and they are not released unless the emigrant and customs authorities agree or families agree to be split apart, ” said Fluharty.
Families are held in three locations of immigrants and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas, and Karnes County.
The children in these places are between 1 and 17 years of age, according to lawyers and lawyers who provide legal assistance.
Gee, who supervises the implementation of the Flores Convention on Child Care in Prison, said in June that “the rules on masking and social distantness were not or uncompliant” were important to transfer children from these stations.
969 persons in custody of the migrant and customs authorities have been diagnosed with the corona virus and are under isolation or surveillance from 23 July, according to the migrant and customs authorities.
Of these, 25 cases are confirmed in Karnes, one in Dilley and two in family prison centers.
Over 3700 cases have been confirmed in custody
Will Review a Legislation on the Independence of Governors
The Prime Minister does not suggest that pension funds set aside in their investment policy on the rights of workers.
Comments from the Bank Manager on the need to ensure the independence of governments of pension funds, possibly by law, will be considered.
After Icelandair broke up with the Iceland Airmaid Association and resigned from all airlines, the VR declared that governments appointed by the VR in the management of the Citizens' Life Earnings Fund, or voted against participation of the Life Earnings Fund in Icelandair's prospective share-financing bid.
Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, chairman of the VR, went on to say that governments would be replaced if they did not respond to the recommendations.
Ragnar Thorr withdrawn his statement three days later and also the control of the VR.
Assgeir Jonsson, bank manager said in the news of RUV on Friday that it would be necessary to ensure the independence of the governments of the pension funds in the funds' agreement and possibly by legal change.
The Prime Minister, Katrín Jacob’s daughter, says that the governments of the pension funds are independent, but they already consider it secure by law.
“ Now, ” she says, “the manager of the Banking Bank, who of course deals with the financial services involved, has said that if something needs to go over there, we will have to look into the rules of this independence, ” she says.
Katrín says that according to the law, pension funds should set moral standards in their investment policy.
It is desirable to discuss the social and moral standards they want to highlight in their investments.
“ I didn’t think anything abnormal was that pension funds also set aside in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
But I believe that such decisions are made through policy, not through exceptional investment decisions," says Katrín.
“ An irritable road block at the Alfous Bridge, ” says the president of the city’s city government
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the city of Årburg, says a traffic block that is formed at the Alfus Bridge on Selfossi every day completely irresistible.
He hopes that an invitation for a new bridge over the River Alphus will take place in the fall.
Today, when Iceland is traveling through its country, the roadways of the country are making daily roadblocks at the Alphus Bridge when drivers are on the way to Selfoss or through the community.
Long rows form at the edge and can take the patient of the drivers to wait in order.
“ Yes, it’s totally irritating, it’s one traffic block here and not just on Fridays, because it’s just been in working days too.
There are long beds, sometimes quite up to Hellisheeds for those who want to get past here on their way east to the land and those who are coming west, so it gives us an eye that we need a new bridge and not later than yesterday," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City.
Helgi says that the city authorities recently met with the President of the Road and the Designer of the Road, and that meeting was very positive.
“ If you have ever been optimistic about working on these matters, I think I can say it now because it is really working on this and we should be able to see that a new bridge will be invited out in the fall. ”
But is there any counsel to the drivers who are in the queue of the Alphebruary all day over the summer?
“ Yes, it is possible to go through the narrows and through the Earlands, but those who are going eastwards, it cannot be pointed out to them to go the Lyngdal plain, but those who are going to the upheavals should use Mosfells, The Assembly, and the Lyngdal Sheet. ”
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the city’s city government, which says the traffic block, formed at the Alphus Bridge of Selfoss irresistible.
Long beds are formed every day at the Alfous Bridge, and drivers often need to wait for a considerable amount of time to cross the bridge.
Then the only advice is to take a deep breath and think something positive.
The Future of Coal Bears in the North of Brisbane is subject to Organization Judgment
In addition to the vital home of the coal bears, the squirrels, and the grey spik, it was an important link between the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
Professionals have appealed against the rejection of the City Government to the Court of Justice of Organization and the Environment in order to argue that the structure is consistent with the law on urban organization since 2014, would meet the organisational and social needs which have not yet been met and could be carried out without an inadmissible effect.
There is great opposition to these planned projects in the suburban environment.
They argue that even though the proposal is fully in line with the organisation, it could be changed if it does not meet requirements rather than reject it.
At present, there are many stages, including service stations, childcare facilities, and 39 apartments.
There were more than 120 public submissions at the time of the convention, and most of them objected to the proposal because it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The minority leader of Brisbane said that the city had to buy the land to protect the Coal Bears.
“ Adrian Schrinner has to stop wasting taxpayers’ money in the fight with the managers for judgment and buying this country to protect the natural and animal life of Brisbane, ” said City Commissioner Cassidy.
“ This is one of the most important homes of coal bears in the natural area Mountain to Mangroves, where there are many coal bears. ”
Schrinner said this week that the city government wanted the local coal bears to be protected.
“We didn’t feel fit for the area, ” Schrinner said.
“ I understand that this is going through the judicial system, and clearly we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will keep our home. ”
Schrinner said that a map of the local coal bears was the joint responsibility of the city and government, but that the government was responsible for accurate maps of coal bears’ homes supported by local authorities when they apply for applications for treatment.
Sunshine: Next step is winning something
Ole Gunnar Solskin, Coach Man Utd, was a hoping fighter with the team secured a third place in the English outfit today.
The team will therefore play in the Championship of Europe during the next period.
The United needed equal or victory against Leicester today and was the result of the Red Devils 2 to 0.
“ A great achievement for the players to reach third place according to the situation during the period.
I think we boys might have crossed a spiritual sound by winning such a big game, since we've lost twice during this period.
We knew we needed a final today, now we can have the next chapter that these boys will have to win titles," said Solskin winners.
Manchester United still has the possibility of winning a title during this period, but the team plays in the European Division in August and is almost in the 8-point final there.
A cease-fire starts at midnight in war-contained East Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine — Ukrainian Army and Resistance in eastern Ukraine are now preparing “a complete ” arms break that will begin at midnight and as representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after 6 years of conflict.
On Sunday, representatives of opponents said that they had ordered their soldiers to resume their arms, and they issued a decree for banning arms use.
The Ukrainian Army said that its army had “prepared ” for the cease of arms.
If this was achieved, it would “bear the way for the implementation of other provisions ” of the Minsk peace treaty, as stated by the president’s office of Ukraine earlier this week, where the cease-fire was called a time-limit.
The aim of the Minsk peace treaty, made in 2015 by France and Germany, was to settle the conflicts between Ukraine and the apartheid who enjoy Russia’s support, which began in 2014 after Russia’s membership of the Cremskagans and the country’s support for apartheid.
More than 14,000 people have died in the fight.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine welcomed both the arms break on Sunday and stressed the importance of the agreement reached at the Paris Summit in December.
Vladimir Pútín, President of Russia, expressed concern over the call from Kiev for the Minks Convention to be reviewed and said that the position of Mr Selenskij, President of Ukraine, about “the unchangeableness of the Minsk Convention, which he renewed in this call, should be reflected in real actions. ”
Selenskij, on the other hand, stressed the need to take more action to deliver the Ukrainian prisoners of rebels in East Ukraine, in the limbed Krim and in Russia, according to the President’s office declaration.
According to the agreement from 2015, Ukraine can only have jurisdiction over borders with Russia in the areas in which apartheids are in power when they have received widespread right of self-control and when elections have been held in the territories.
The convention reduced conflicts, but Ukraine’s armies and rebels have continued to be interfering.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany met in Paris in December to hold other talks, the Minsk Convention was supported and agreed to resume the peace process.
Selenskij, who won the elections in 2019 with promises to bring an end to the conflict, wanted Ukraine to have jurisdiction over the borders for the first regional campaigns, but the Kreml government demands that the agreement be implemented without any change.
The new arms break agreement was reached on Wednesday by a three-sided group of representatives of Russia and Ukraine, as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by EU officials.
At the conventional Sunday greeting of Peterstorg, Pope Fran also referred to the cease of arms, saying that “rebuild the trust and lay the foundation for very necessity and long - long - suffering peace with the people. ”
Police: A man shot to death in protests in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A man was shot to death in protests in Texas when he approached a car and the driver in his car fired his weapon, according to the police.
In the early Sunday, Katrina Ratliff, a spokesman of the police, told journalists that the shooting took place just before 22:00 a.m. in protests in Austin.
The man was taken to a hospital, where he was later decreed dead.
The car had whistled, turned down the road, and then speeded up the journey towards the Protestants, said the Witness Michael Capochiano to Austin American-Statesman.
According to Capochiano, the man with a rifle approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver drove away, said Capochiano.
Ratliff told the reporters that the first news was that “the victim may have had a rifle, ” adding that the suspect was in custody and willing to cooperate with the police.
According to the news offices, the group had gathered for the Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday.
The testimony was streamed directly on Facebook, where the flake of the car and a few shots were fired.
Blika’s first victory in July
In a moment, the first division wins from June 29, when the team killed the IA, 5-3 at Pepsi Max section of men at Copavogs tonight.
On the other hand, traitors lose their third game in a row in the department.
After winning his first three games in the department, Breatagen played five games without celebrating victory and had lost three in a row for the IA game tonight.
It was, therefore, to do enough or to die for Blika, who was involved with great effort.
Alexander Helgi Victory’s son led the team with a fine delivery in the 11th minute after Kristin Steindor’s son had sent him through the defense of the IA.
Six minutes later, Christine doubled the lead after the very fine preparation of Gisla, the son of Eyev, on the left side.
In the first half - game, no land and no beach could be reached, since local high - pressers made it difficult for them to link transmissions together.
The flashes had all the power of the field, and the third mark was harvested in the 36th minute, when Dan Thomas Mikkelsen smote the corner of Höskulder, the son of Gunnlaug.
Then the son of St. Steindors scored his second mark and the fourth mark Blika just three minutes later.
However, the story of the first half game did not end there.
For the second time, when Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson cut out a wattage shortly before a play break, Kwame Quee had broken Viktori Jonsson in the rim of Blika.
Thus, 4-1 was the situation for a Break moment when the semi-player balloon was defected.
Only three minutes had passed from the second half of the game when the Skags scored again.
Then, the Hlyn of the Savar son was alone and unequipped on the market Blika and easily guided the ball to the net by the corner of Tryggva, Harald’s son.
On the other hand, only three minutes later, when he broke Alexander Helga, there was a breach within the IA.
Vitisspyrna was convicted, and Thomas Mikkelsen challenged safety to move the moment 5-2 over after only seven minutes of the second half.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's mark, Skagamen scored again.
Anton Ari Einarsson, a target watchman of Blika, was pressed by Viktor John’s son, and gave the ball to Viktor’s foot from which the ball was rejected in the network.
Unbelievable 5-3 positions were seen when less than 10 minutes had passed from the later half-play, but it slowed down the market challenge followed.
Despite a fine chance for both teams to add to the limits, including two deaths of Kwame Quee from the Break Break, they were no more, and 5–3 successes of the Breaky Game.
A moment, then, won his first victory for less than a month, since June 29, and has passed after the victory with 14 points in third place, two points from Val above and three from the KR top.
However, the KR and Vals are both involved in Blika.
The IA has to accept the third loss in a row in the division, but the team has ten points in eighth seats, five points from the falls.
Despite the White House’s comments, the puppy team is not in danger
The producer of the Puppy Team was right yesterday not to stop showing the child material in the near future.
The statement follows Kayleigh McEnany, a media representative of the White House, that the factors involved in law enforcement dogs were victims of “decommissioning cultures ” (e.g. cancel culture).
The Canadian producers responded quickly to McEnany’s words, stating that their fans had no need to worry about the future of the Puppy League.
A number of television shows that discuss police work have been taken out of a show in the United States lately following a protest against police violence.
The puppy band, however, is not part of it, despite the reputation of that material on social media.
At a press conference in the White House on Friday, McEnany said that President Trump was opposed to “unexclusion culture, ” especially when it came to the police.
The term refers to the fact that the comments or actions of individuals or firms cause a severe reaction to the media and is called after the object is dismissed in the objection.
“ We saw a few weeks ago that the puppy team’s show, child - care programs for cops, was stopped.
The same is true of the Cops and Live PD," said McEnany on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish toy manufacturer Lego took a lawman’s set from sale, but there is no foot for that claim, according to Lego’s defense officers.
However, it is true that the realities of Cops and Live PD have recently been taken out of the Western Sea.
Both sections are controversial for showing videos of real police work without permission from individuals present there.
Together for 29 years — Sometimes jealousy and suspicion occur
Christian Thomas ’ daughter, a family treater, answers a reader’s questions about matters related to family, children, and love in the Family Corner of DV.
This time, she responds to readers who have never been single.
We've been together since we were 15 years old, we've been together for 29 years, and we have two children.
We know nothing but to be together and feel good, but we both feel like we're missing something.
We have never been with other people, and we have no comparison of how this could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust when it comes to whether the other person is looking around, thinking of adultery, or even divorce, and changing.
When we talk about this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is such a bruise that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for the great question and I am so glad that you have such open communication that you can discuss your complexity with your relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking this one in each corner, you couldn't talk about this and even take some steps that you could later regret.
Everything on the table, isn't it always the best?
A strong self - image has the greatest foreseeable value of happiness in the future and the stronger self - image you have, the more likely you will be to have a mate with a strong self - image.
The reason that relationships that begin during adolescent years do not last all the time is often that people develop in each direction, but in those cases in which they become captive, individuals can become stronger than many others.
Since your relationship begins to form during your greatest years of forming, it can be concluded that you have matured together and have a positive influence on each other’s self - identity.
For example, we are molded by our relationships.
The way I talk, shaped by the way you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
Relationship shapes who we are.
Would you turn the case around and think, ‘ What do we have that others do not have? ’
What does these many years of specialty give us?
I agree to claim that the advantages can be much more than the defects.
You have formed each other for years, and as a result, you are customized in millimetres.
That is more than many can say.
That worth it?
You talk about your experience of missing something, but it is important to remind yourself that big changes, such as divorce and new relationships, are also related to what you are not necessarily excited about.
You may miss starting up again, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and setting up families.
These include new challenges, different problems, and potentially something new and exciting.
But this does not just include pink clouds and happiness, no, at your age, this can become a complicated project, which may never be as well as you have already done to each other.
Is it worth it?
Rather, why not put your focus on what you can do to increase tension, unforeseenness, and newness in your relationship?
You haven't put your shoes on the shelf yet.
There are so many things you can do to deepen your long relationship.
What experiments can you make in this regard?
What do you need from your mate that you are not getting?
What can you give to your mate that you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and define your relationship again.
Would you like to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today, much more tolerability to various forms of relationship is being defined by couples in various ways, such as open relationships, multi-friendships, or temporary interruption.
I'm not telling you at all what to do, though no expert on your solutions, but possibly it would lighten this heavy fat that is coming over you, if you face this and think about solutions.
What need you so distrust and fear disappear?
You've been together for 29 years, that must mean you're capable of things together.
Take advantage of it as strength and hold hands towards your solution.
We urge readers to send their questions and spectacles to Christian by e-mail at: Joinbandssaela@gmail.com.
The questions will then be answered here in the Family Corner, of course anonymous and confidential.
Lost the cup and broke it
Despite the great experience that Branislav Ivanovic has in lifting the cups and celebrating titles, he lost and broke a magnificent award in joy after becoming a Russian cup champion yesterday.

It's a war!
Coleen Rooney advises Johnny Depp attorney in the Wagatha Christie rim to Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against the accusations of injury against Rebekah Vardy.
After conversations between the soccer mates, their acquaintances expect a dramatic finish
Coleen Rooney has hired the star lawyer in Johnny Depp's injuries to defend himself in his so-called "Wagatha Christie" legal dispute with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday simulates that Rooney has assigned David Sherborne to defend herself against the accusation that she had been injured against Vardy, claiming that personal information was leaked to the media by its closed Instagram access.
A few days after data were submitted to the Supreme Court, Rebekah Vardy, married to the attorney Jamie Vardy of the Leicester City football team, suffered physically and spiritually according to Coleen Rooney’s claims.
The magazine reports that the 38 - year - old mother, five children, “has had severe frustration and anxiety attacks, so she was afraid to leave the house, ” and that Vardy, then seven months later,“ had been hospitalized three times... because of an anxiety caused by the entry and its consequences. ”
In addition to being a lawyer of Depp in his injuries against the Sun, because of claims that the actor beat his wife, Sherborne, 50 years old, goes with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their private case against Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Mail on Sunday.
After negotiation between the two two soccer friends failed, those who know of dramatic ceremony in the courtroom are expected to fail.
“ If you felt the Depp trial, do not underestimate the prospective war of the football boys, ” said a source.
“ Now this is a real war, and Coleen gives no notice, nor Becky.
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone who used the Instagram access of Rebekah Vardy had leaped up a story about it to a newspaper.
She was named "Wagatha Christie" after clarifying how she spent five months in slowly limiting the number of friends who could see updates on Instagram stories, until only Vardy's account was left.
Coleen then claims to have set up an invented story on Instagram, which had then appeared in a gossip.
In the records of Vardy, who refuses to participate in the case, she claims that it was made a blunder after Rooney published the accusations “to be deliberate, with the objective of causing great harm and tremendous suffering. ”
Coleen’s lawyers have questioned these words and say that claims about her suffering are only presented to the media and distracts the facts.
A source commented: “The documents from Becky are misleading; it’s all inventory. ”
It is the lawyer Paul Lunt at Brabner’s Lawyer at Liverpool, who deals with Coleen Rooney, who has four sons with former England champion Wayne Rooney.
Vardy is at Kingsley Napley, London, where she may not have hired a lawyer yet.
Coleen Rooney’s spokesman refused to interview.
Bidens’s campaign team refuses the “Fox News Sunday” interview one week after the Chris Wallace interview with Trump
In Trump's interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump doubted that the future presidential Democrat, Joe Biden, would handle the questionnaire that Wallace dropped on Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question — at least not at the moment.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the audience that the Bidens election team had told Fox News that he was “not free ” for an interview.
“ In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his adversary in the Democrat class, Joe Biden, would plumber in similar circumstances, ” said Wallace.
“ In the week, Bidens’ election team asked for an interview, and they said that the former Vice President was not free. ”
“ We keep asking each week, ” he added.
Trump’s campaign has been criticized for months by Biden for avoiding election meetings and press conferences during interviews during the crown virus epidemic.
Although Biden recently started his election tour again, Trump and his companions continued to mock the former Vice President for hiding in their home in Delaware.
However, the reluctant Bidens to attend public events has not damaged his offer, since the latest surveys show that Biden has a good predecessor at Trump, both nationally and in major war countries.
Mean Real Clear Politics indicates that the President was 7 percent below in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all four states in 2016 when he turned them over to the Republican Party when he won the fight for the White House.
In the recent Fox News Poll survey, Biden has a predecessor in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, in all cases.
The surveys also indicate that Biden has a little precedence in Ohio, North Carolina, and Arizona, three other important fighters in these elections.
And the surveys indicate that states that were formerly trusted fortresses of the Republic of Germany, such as Texas and Georgia, are now divided between Trumps and the former Vice President.
Presidential elections in the White House are often voting for that president — and this seems to be the case now in 2020 in the battle between Trumps and Bidens.
The main topics have been the crown virus and the economy that is low due to the epidemic – and the performance and history of the President in both cases.
Kanye West and his wrestling with the moods
Today, musician Kanye West asked his wife, Kim Kardashian, for apologise for the speech he made in a pitiful way.
The chairman of Psychiatrics believes that he is taking his creative force in the psychiatrists, but a psychiatrist says important that people take medicines to keep the disease under control.
The Rapper Kanye West is not just one of the most original and most influential musicians of the time, but he is not less famous as the husband of the reality star Kim Kardashian.
His personal life has largely been preceded by openness.
Earlier in this month, he announced that he was presenting himself to the president of the United States, and he held an emotionally crushed speech.
Later, on Twitter, some strange scratches appeared on Twitter, claiming that his wife was trying to put him in a hospital.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram, where she asked people to show their husband and family understanding; he had bipolar disorder, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want to seek help himself.
Since then, he has made public apology to her.
This famous family is not the only one who faces this problem.
Approximately one percent of people are expected to have mental reactions.
Ferdinand Jonsson, a head doctor of a psychiatrist in London, knows well about the disease.
“ This disease can make individuals, especially their families and loved ones, so uncomfortable.
This pride or mania can destroy relationships and work and cause a tremendous grief.
And then the other side, the depression, it's often extremely dangerous, because there's a high rate of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was beautiful that she said that.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
Unnsteinsson, chairman of Psychiatrics, has himself wrestled with psychiatric disorders — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very fierce imagination.
If we are four strings of earthly counterbass, he is a hundred strings of heavenly harp.
And he's so incredibly creative, incredibly powerful and clearly in his powerful connection thought, because you're going to be aware of this connection thought that we who've been given to try it in a state of pride know so well."
Kanye West does not want to take antipsychotics, because he thinks they're reducing his creativity.
He's been discussing the moods, including the Ye record.
It is said that it is his choice not to take medication.
“ A lot of people feel that this creative element is staggered by this unreasonable connection thought and the superb creative power of the fire he has, but so are natural defects of this often great suffering, and the waves and dark basements and darkness. ”
However, Ferdinand says that it is important that people with bipolar disorder are treated.
“ If you have a lot of pride or mania, you don’t make anything wonderful, you’re just on the side.
And as when people get into severe depression, people are completely paralyzed by that condition," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medicines?
"Absolutely," says Ferdinand.
“ And in particular working with someone to find the right doses and this way to balance the use of the drugs to help him as much as possible, destroying him and his ability and his creativity. ”

Delhi Metro casts the first pillar at the fourth stage of implementation
Delhi Metro reached an important stage at the fourth stage of implementation when the first pillar was cast on the road between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg, which is under way, according to officials on Sunday.
The pillar was cast into Keshopur and on an elevated part between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday night.
“Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) stepped another important step at the fourth stage of the implementation when the first pillar at this stage of the expansion of the train system was stunned by the road between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg, ” stated DMRC.
In spite of a considerable lack of labour and other organisational challenges caused by the pandemic, this “important implementation phase” was achieved, according to staff.
The average height of the pillars on this way is 10 meters.
On the other hand, the pillars will be 20 meters high at Madhuban Chowk, where the road crosses 1 and 25 meters at Haiderpur Badli Mor, where the road reaches 2.
With Haiderpur Badli Mor, the bridge road will be 28 meters high, which is the largest height of Dehli Metro’s history, as stated in the statement.
The highest point of the train system is at Dhaula Kuan, where a bridge road leads 7 to a height of 23.6 feet [3.6 m].
In the context of construction engineering, pillars are vertical pressured works that support the adjacent end of two paths.
They form vertical works that carry up the elevated bridge road of the train system.
These train - system pillars can be seen on the countless major roads under the Deli train - tracks.
The number of the pillars now plays an important role in identifying addresses in the Deli city area.
The 28.92 km long way from Janakpuri West to R K Ahsram Marg is an expansion on the Magenta route and on it will be 22 stations.
21.18 km of the road will be raised and 7.74 km underground.
By December last year, the construction of this part began.
July 17 began working in the underground part of the road when the construction of a crochet wall was started at Krishna Park Extension train station.
On June 24th, DMRC began to cast up U-bursting pieces that would later be placed in an elevated part of the road.
At the fourth stage of the implementation, 61,679 km of new trains will be set for three different routes by 45 train stations.
These new parts will provide connections between the part of the train system already operated by Delhi Metro.
Of them, 22.35 km underground and other parts will be raised.

Ambassador wants a gun, a armored car, and a stunning vest - said subscribers are the ambassador of the “deep state ”
The political ambassador of the United States, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, is said to want to carry a gun in the CBS news story today.
Starting the news of CBS: “Despite being located in one of the most secure states in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter is“ paranoid ” about his safety since he arrived in Reykjavik last year. ”
Points CBS to 12 diplomates, diplomats, and former representatives, as well as individuals who know the case.
The conclusion of Gunters was to demand from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs that they requested permission for the ambassador paranoid to walk around armed in this country.
He should also have asked for an armor - guard car that traveled with him between places in Iceland and a stud - vest.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to state whether any threat caused the safety of the ambassador, but the representatives of the U.S. government said that the ambassador was told that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
Yet, a bodyguard had been advertised in Icelandic magazines, says CBS, and if this is part of meeting the ambassador’s demands.
CBS reports that the Iceland State Department did not want to talk to CBS about the matter.
However, the U.S. news agency, according to its sources here in the country, has made no wish for the governments of this matter.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of walking around armed as it would offend the Kingdom of Iceland.
The ambassador received his rank as a reward for supporting Donald Trump's elections in the 2016 presidential elections.
Earlier, he was a skin doctor in California.
Since Gunter took over in Mai, when he said that he had created an “impossible ” working environment in the Embassy, and he has already had seven subordinates, called Deputy Chief of Mission, subscribers of the Ambassador, who are also posted diplomats.
It was all experienced diplomats from the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The first one was sent away by the ambassador “because he did not like his appearance. ”
He had already prepared for a year and learned Icelandic.
The next one lasted for only six months.
Afterward, a rotation of staff was created, and the thought was to let Gunter be like most of them until he looked at one of them.
Furthermore, CBS says that Gunter was expecting the ambassador’s staff to go for the “deep state ” and to have undermined him with regard to the Washington D.C. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Heads of the D.C. Foreign Ministry are well aware of the situation in their Reykjavik ambassador, but have hesitated to seize the control of the ambassador's anarchy in view of the connections of Gunter with the White House.
It is also said that Gunter had difficulties following the orders of the Washington Foreign Ministry, and he was said to have refused to return to D.C. while Covid-19 epidemic.
He left the embassy in the hands of his staff for months.
When he was told to work from his home in California, except by the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Finally Turning Back
Having finally received the order, Gunter would return to Iceland in May.
His new commander, Michelle Yerkin, came to the country this month.
CBS has not received any answers to their questions to the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to communicate with CBS, nor did the DV question.
Gunter is one of a number of politically appointed ambassadors of the Trump government that has drawn attention to unusual behavior during the last few months.
To illustrate, when the day came, Woody Johnson was trying to move a British open golf championship to a golf field owned by Trump.
The Ambassador in South Africa has also convicted his number two and then tried to appoint her son to the job.
42% of the U.S. ambassador is politically appointed.
30% were politically appointed to Obama government, and 32% in George W. Bush government.

Poland will report a European Convention on the Prevention of Violence against Women
The Polish Right Government says that the country will withdraw from a European treaty to prevent violence against women.
The Istanbul treaty is the first binding legal act in the world, which aims to prevent violence against women, but the Polish Minister of Justice, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as “injurious ” because it requires schools to blame children on gender from a social point of view.
Ziobro said about the weekend that on Monday he would start preparing a formal process for the country to report the contract.
“This ideological element is related to attempts to change education in schools and leisure work, to study, attitude and conviction of the younger generation of Poland, based on the conclusion that we consider to be wrong, that biological sex is old-fashioned and that everything is really about social sex. ”
Ziobro considers that the provisions of the Convention on Education of Children and Young People and Family Relations in the context of the LGBTs are inappropriate.
“We also reject the LGBT feature in the discussion on family affairs, because this is an opinion held up by left activists or groups of homosexuals who want their opinions to become binding law, ” he said.
On Sunday, the European Council said that it was “surprising ” that Poland was reluctant to share the agreement.
On Friday, Warszawa, some 2,000 people, including groups of women and other groups of rights fighters, protested outside the offices of the Right Officers of Ordo Luris, who supports the fact that the country is declaring the contract.
“We will not be victims, ” they called them.
Protestants also took place in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul treaty to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and fulfilled it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, engineer in Honor Palace, dead 81 years old.
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, a member of the Quarter Mile Traffic Empire, including Lee’s father and his brother Richard, who was the first machinemaker taken into Nascar’s Honorary Hall, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family didn't give up his cause of death.
His funeral has not been reported.
While his other family members were commended for their skills behind the steering wheel, Maurice Petty won his nickname “The Boss ” for his skills with the screw key.
He helped his family to win 198 races and seven titles in NASCAR’s excellence department, and also built machines that secured Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton’s victory.
“ The manager was one of the most prominent engineers in NASCAR’s history, ” said the chairman and manager Jim France.
“ He brought the power that helped Petty Enterprises to achieve his superiority in the field of sport.
Although Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also played various roles behind the tents and did what was necessary to get his cars on the winning track."
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939, in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the raceway when he was little, and his knowledge of engineering soon became a major factor in the winning of Lee Petty in 54 races and three championships.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR cup between 1960 and 64, seven times in the top five seats and 16 times in the top ten.
However, he soon decided to focus on what would happen under the engine shield rather than behind the steering wheel, which proved to be fine to his older brother, who relied on his machines during his victory.
Richard, then called the King, won the first championship title along with the Boss in 1964 with the Plymouth car.
Again, in 1967, two years in a row in 1970 and 1971, they won three more titles before the end of the 1970 ’ s.
With these seven titles on their backs, they share the score in the highest number of titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“ Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers of NASCAR and was involved in Petty Enterprises in building one of the top teams in NASCAR, ” said Winston Kelley in a statement.
“ Although Petty’s winners are recorded as 212, he is entitled to more than 250 wins if taken with all the machines he built for his competitors.
The boss will be remembered forever as one of the best engineers in NASCAR's history."
Lee Petty died in 2000, and Patricia, Maurice Petty’s wife, died in 2014.
He was also cousin to the former driver and to the mediaman Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, Lieutenant in the car race.
“ Although we now say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and skillful pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his heritage and name will be kept in our memory, kept up and preserved forever, ” said Kelley.
“We send our deepest sympathy to the Petty family. ”

Serbia wants to increase the number of military planes in growing tensions on the Balkans
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its army and seek to buy more military planes for the tension of the Balkans, said the president of Serbia on Sunday.
Aleksandar Vucic said that “some deliberations ” were under way to buy fleets of battleplanes, accusing the United States and other Western states of armed neighbourhoods of Serbia, which are in NATO, as well as Kosovo, who were formerly province of Serbia.
“ Americans, Turks, and Germans take care of their beloved offspring, ” said Vucic, referring to Kosovo.
He said that the United States had recently delivered to the Cosovo security troops a number of armored cars.
On a campaign for the Serbian Army Army, Vucic said that his people could not compete with NATO’s “contributions ” to the arms armor of their neighbors and that“ that’s why we’re up to ourselves. ”
Vucic did not specify the type of Serbian military planes, but the media of loyal governments claim that his government officially requested 20 attack planes from the United States.
It appears that Washington did not receive an answer to the request from Belgrade and that it is likely that attack aircraft of the type of Sukhoi-25 will be purchased from Russia.
Serbia, prosecuting a military neutrality policy, has recently received a high - level air protection system from Russia, which has also provided battleplanes, attack helicopters, and armored vehicles.
China, also a Serbian Alliance, has delivered the state to use in warfare.
U.S. officials have been openly discussing the launch of penalties against Serbia if more weapons come to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could jeopardise the safety of neighbouring NATO Member States.
In the western and neighboring countries of Serbia, people are concerned about the armaments of Russians and Chinese in Serbia.
The tension is now increasing on the Balkans, where civil wars in the 1990 ’ s were devastated.
The Atlantic Alliance intervened in Serbia to stop Serba’s bloody operations against the Cosonova-Albana separators in 1999.
Although formally endeavouring to join the European Union, Serbia’s populist leader has further strengthened his political and military relationship with Kreml and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, do not acknowledge the independence of Kosovo, which has been acknowledged by the United States and most Western countries.
Heart attack: The likelihood of this fatal condition may be reduced by eating chocolate once a week
A new study suggests that certain goodness may be good for the heart muscle.
And how could this reduce the chance of a heart attack?
Scientists have analysed coronary artery disease for over 50 years.
The main symptoms of coronary artery disease (also called ischaemic heart disease) are three: chest pain (angi), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptoms may include palpitations and severe shortness of breath.
“Succulated contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoide, methylxanthin, polyphenol and steric acid, which can reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol.”
Good cholesterol, also called high-density lipoprotein, collects “bad” cholesterol – a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart – and transfers it into the liver.
The “bad” cholesterol (low concentration lipoprotein) is broken down in the liver and then separated from the body.
However, the new study does not investigate the dose or type of chocolate consumed.
It is not clear whether participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or other chocolate snacks.
The results were based on an older study that concluded that cocoa consumption (which is found in chocolate) reduced the risk of heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve vascular function.
Vascular function refers to how well the blood disperses oxygen and nutrients through the body and disperses waste.
Lifestyle factors were not mentioned in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said about the evidence that those who had admitted to eating chocolate were more likely to have a healthy body weight.
She added, then, that they could exercise regularly and experience less stress.
“Each of these factors could affect the health of the cardiovascular system independently, ” she added.
Coles replaces plastic toys with books in a new collection campaign.
“ We have really listened, ” Ronson said, “and that was a key factor in preparing a project. ”
“ We do not believe that people want to recycle the books — we think they will want to have them, but they can recycle them at home if they want. ”
Ronson said that the new campaign had been underway long before COVID-19 came into existence, and despite the epidemic, it believes that the timing of the new campaign was “no good ” because of the amount of time parents are now spending with their children.
While analysts have expressed concern for the fact that consumers have become tired of the constant toy collection campaigns of the largest supermarket, Ronson says that there is no sign of fatigue yet.
“ We haven’t seen anything like that yet, ” she said, “but we keep our eyes open to this. ”
“ We report a lot of data, from week to week, month to month, to make sure that what we surrender is in harmony with our clients.
It was Cloes who paved the course for collecting campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, but the first of my year 2018 was the driving force behind the best quarter sales of the supermarket from the beginning.
Woolworths followed with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the supermarket to expand its sales, and now, last time, offers the environmentally friendly introduction campaign Discovery Garden customers to free plants and flowers for planting.
However, the new collection campaign could have a lesser effect this time, since UBS analysts predict increased sales in Australia’s major markets during the 2021 financial year.
Ronson said that customers can expect more multitude of future collection campaigns and that campaigns such as Little Shop are likely to be more uncommon.
“ There is a lot of gathering campaigns around the world that we look at, and we are constantly coming from other countries, ” she said.
“ We need to do this to make sure that we’re doing more and more with our customers. ”
I've been five rounds around the country this summer.
The photographer and the material manufacturer John Ragnar Johnsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, has been more and reminds us of a wander of Iceland since the pandemic.
Jon completed a business study at the University of Reykjavik a few years ago, but he is now working on travelling and producing products for individuals and companies.
The summer began early at John, or April, when he traveled throughout the West feather and stayed in his car.
What's left of a year, he's gone about five or six circles around the country.
Besides, he's been on countless day trips here and there.
What trip has been made?
“ For someone like me who's always on a wander and has seen everything, it's hard to name a favorite place.
It's more the weather and the company that matters.
Having recently traveled highways after the opening of the roads in June.
These travels are always upward, for it is such an adventure to reach their destination.
The last trip there is the possible favourite journey of the year, but then we went 25 together in 5 large cars up by Riverside and from there to Elf Lake."
What is ahead of you this summer?
“ I’m very excited about time, but I was just finishing a diving course with DIVE and now taking diving trips here and there around Iceland.
Then I was adding a surfboard to my “dotass ” so I'll be more out into the sea than before.
I am heading on a 10 - day “solo ” journey with everything I need my back, but later this summer, where I go.
Otherwise, I'm going to be very high in the next few years, since there's no way to check that area all year."
What is your favorite place in Iceland?
“ It’s always hard to choose one place, but the Jack’s salary has been a part of my life since I remember.
Every summer, my family and I went to a dwelling place at the roots of Breamerkjölk, and since then I’ve always had a good time in that area.
I think I'm safe to say I've been there over 100 times."
With what place in Iceland do you recommend visiting people?
“ I’m going to bring one pearl from each part of the country, but it’s: Molecular Juvels in the South, East, Aldeen Falls in the North, Red Assassinates in the West, Snowfall in the West, and last but not the last... Rainfall in the Highlands. ”
What is essential for the journey?
“ I don’t go to the land unless I have the following in my car: good pocket lights, hanging room, lope buckets, hunting knives, eagle cushion, chilling boxes, and beetles... those who know me know what I’m talking about. ”
Searching for 24 rodents fearing drowning from the island of Malaysia
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) – The Malaysia authorities said on Sunday that there were searches for 25 roaming refugees who fear to have drowned after jumping off a boat from the tourist island of Langkawi, north of Malasia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a high official of Malaysia’s land sanctuary, said that the first information police showed that only one of the routers 25 jumped off the boat had swimped to the land.
According to Zawawi, the survivor sought help from a police officer late on Saturday and has been held under further investigation.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim rodents have escaped Myanmar because of military operations, many of whom live in overwhelming refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of the people in Malaysia, which has been a timely destination of boats that promise refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and airplanes were used to search.
He said that the seafarers in the area and the authorities in the neighbouring Thailand will also be alerted to help with the search.
He didn't give any more information about the boat.
In the last month, the authorities in Malaysia held 269 roach refugees in custody and found a body on board a boat suspected of being used to smuggle off the coast of Langkawi, who claimed he was deliberately damaged so that he could not return to sea.
Later, Malaysia’s patrols reported that the 269 individuals were transferred from a larger ship with dozens of people who were thought to have died and that their bodies were thrown into the sea.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said that Malasia could not accept any more refugees because they struggle with economic conditions because of the crown virus epidemic.
He said, however, that those already in the land would not be sent back to sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants live in addition to some 180,000 refugees and refugee seekers — including 101,000 rodents — registered at the United Nations Refugee Organization.
Inhabitants of Aswan collect, watch, and return a cargo of chocolate to Sudan by car rotation
The transport car is on the way to Sudan with many tons of chocolate on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the street front of the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver fell into a coma due to a temperature.
The villagers grouped to help the driver where he was lying and to save the goods that had been oiling.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, described his position so that the driver “was walking past our village; we could not just pass by.
We're supposed to help people in distress, no matter where they come from."
He added, then, that the villagers had come for an ambulance to get the driver and then tried to save the car car that is estimated to be three million pounds of Egypt.
Bahr said the villagers were in the field from morning to evening and saved as much of the cargo as they could.
“ What we thought most important was saving the driver’s life, protecting the cargo, and reopening the international road, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the injured driver with water and shelter, said Bahr, and they added that they wanted to make sure that he could get to and from the village safe.
There were already profanes in the Senate, and the crown virus could make them worse.
“ The world epidemic alone calls on our elected representatives for the leadership and vision we expect in times of trouble, ” says a report prepared from the series of interviews held by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communications at the American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
“ But we are also faced with other debts that relate to the inherited sin of our nation and to the racial inequality that has plagued our land since its establishment. ”
The study examines familiar material in connection with the pathetic state of the Senate: the lack of real links between categories, a timetable limiting communications opportunities, excessive integration of authority in leadership positions, continuous financial requirements, comparative cooperation between categories, the negative impact of media operating throughout the day, the fact that the most important elections for parliaments are often precognition and finally the silence of minority groups.
It is also warned that the Senate is moving more into a world of networks because of the pandemic, where such a system, which allows the elections by surrogates of representatives without having to travel to Washington, could further increase the problems that exist.
If the idea of a distant meeting reaches its footstep, it would be a serious relapse for attempts to increase inter-group communication, as the report says.
“ For the sake of the world epidemic, the Senate was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet, and we certainly understand why, ” says the report.
“ But even though it was necessary, it should not be interpreted as virtue. ”
The paper says that the Congress needs “more than no less communication between congressmen, face to face. ”
They need to learn more about each other's districts, have polite conversations to find common surfaces and build up links based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
This week, when Ted Yoho, Senator of the Republic of Florida, attacked Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez, Senator of Democrata of New York, and his companions in the Rebound Group agreed to attack Liz Cheney, Senator of the Democratic Republic of Wyoming, with hostile words.
Congresswoman Val Demings discusses the Vice-President, let Trump hear it for grace.
The Congresswoman Val Demings (democrats, Florida) was not shy about discussing its interest in the office of Vice President of Joe Biden’s potential government and expressing sincere gratitude for being taken into account for the office.
This respected member of the Black Group was interviewed with BlackPressUSA on the direct broadcast for #FIYAH! Live Theatre, and told her about her story, activity, and commitment that has brought her to the place she is today, and started with the words “You know all my story; I grew up as the daughter of a worker and housekeeper in Jacksonville, Florida. ”
Demings was one of the four prosecutors of the Congress of Representatives at the Donald Trump trial in January.
Regardless of whether Trump is a conviction, it will be recorded in the story that he is the fourth President, accused.
In an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, the former prosecutor of the Assembly of Prosecutors said: “Was this worth it?
She added that despite the disappointment of the decision, Democrats had been obliged to follow the case after any outcome.
In the interview, Demings made it clear that she is opposed to the pardon of Trump of Roger Stone’s Stone prison sentence, who was convicted of lying before the Senate (in addition to other criminals) as well as his pardon for other criminals who were convicted of similar crimes, when she said: “The lack of lawlessness to accommodate your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover up your iniquity. ”
Deamings is at the top of the Joe Biden list of potential candidates for Vice Presidents, which also contains CBC Chairman Karen Bass (democrats, California), Stacey Abram's former Congressman Georgia, Senators Kamöla Harris (democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (democrats, Illinois), Mayor Keisha Lance Bottom, Mayor Susan Rice, U.S.A., and several others.
However, she stated that only one person would decide who would offer Joe Biden the fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she drew her hand to her mouth while she laughed and pretended to whisper to those who watched the direct broadcast, and added: “If you want to call... you can do it for me. ”
There is no doubt that regardless of political views, history books will view this as a time when American politics and attitudes developed.
It didn't miss Demings.
She pointed out that the number of women offered to the Vice President of the United States is an opportunity to break through the rest of the “glass roof ” — especially for women of African origin.
“ It’s exactly these opportunities that I’m working so hard on all my life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money, or that they’re of the wrong kind, ” she said.
The Congresswoman decided to ensure that the National Committee of the Democrats and Biden’s election team would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to get as many people to vote as possible.
“ I will call Tom Perez (president of the National Committee of the Democrats), and I will put this on top of my list, ” promised Demings.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the campaign.
When she replied to the words of former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost his elections, and another editorial that says that the President is preparing to recover himself, lived over Demings: “As much as suggests to make myself feel sick. ”
“ But who would ever do it except Trump?
I think he hates this job.
You should not be able to escape from breaking the law and ignore the Constitutional Rules in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he hates losing.
I can believe that the President will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to handle it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those who make it happen."
Bottles for children
There are bottles for children who want to drink to their parents from young age in bottles that fit the table in better days.
No doubt there are now some parents who rejoice — or the parents who have been bored with the childish skirt with decorations.
Even so, children are the ones who are reaching out for their parents ’ glasses, for they are more thrilled to see their feet.
These discussed glasses we encountered on the modernhouseessentials.com page, which contains various gold mills.
The bottles have good stumps, stable legs, and suffer good heat, so children can enjoy drinks whether they are hot or cold.
Each bottle contains approximately 150 ml.
Those who want to examine the glasses can look into the home page here, but the glasses are on the offer of these days in a small amount of $1,400 (U.S.).
Alibaba and Jack Ma are brought to trial in Gurugram for the deputy of the former staff.
Gurugram, July 26: Alibaba’s company and its founder, Jack Ma, have been brought to trial in Gurugram after claiming that his former company staff had been fired for protesting inquiry and false news in the company’s programs.
The case is addressed in Gurugram District Court, and the private court judge Sonia Sheokand has issued a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma, and more than 10 others, asking them to come to trial on 29 July, according to news reports.
The judge has also requested written replies from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who worked at UC Web’s office in Gurugram until October 2017, is charged with $268,000 for damages, according to legal documents.
“We are in line with the company’s commitment to the Indian market and the welfare of its employees, and its policies are consistent with the applicable laws.
We cannot express ourselves on the current proceedings, ” UC India stated in a statement.
“ In the appeal, ” says Reuters, “there is also a list of “sensitive words ” containing passwords in hindi and English such as “the borders of India and China ” and “the war between China and India. ”
Last month, the 59 Chinese cell phone programs, including UC News and UC Browser, were banned in response to increased tension between the two countries.
Deputy of the Firefight New York City says it's "absolutely" okay to exclude a white firefighter from the honourable guard.
A New York Firefighting Officer says it's "absolutely" okay to keep a white firefighter away from the honour to make flagbers black, according to new news.
The White Firefighter Daniel McWilliams has appealed for racial discrimination after he was taken out of a group of flagbers at a memorial meeting in November 2017 to commemorate the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, a brethren of black firefighters.
The main representative of firefighter in the field of diversity and availability, the lawyer Cecilia Loving, also defended the decision in the hearing of the New York State Human Rights Department, according to the New York Post.
McWilliams, one of the three firefighters in a historic picture, appears to lift the American flag at Ground Zero on the days after the 11th September attacks.
According to McWilliam's deputy department, the firefighter had chosen him to be alone to the flagberries in honor at the Memorial.
Being a flagber on this ceremony was “a great honor and privilege ” for McWilliams, as stated in the CNN prosecutor.
When he arrived at the ceremony, however, he was prevented from participating in the honour of the then Vulcan Society President, Regina Wilson, for she had claimed that all flagberries at the Mass would be black.
She then asked McWilliams — a 29 - year - old firefighter in New York City — to help in another way. ”
Among the things claimed to have asked him to do, it is to escort civilians and to set up characterized firemen away from the Mass.
McWilliams claims that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the honour because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was, he said.
Wilson, who has served in the New York Firefight for 21 years and also participated in the rescue work on September 11, will have replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliams claims that he abandoned the Memorial “to spare himself for further shame, humiliation, and shame, ” when friends and colleagues heard their interference, according to New York Daily News.
When the black Loving witnessed in court, Mr. McWilliam’s lawyer, Keith Sullivan, asked her: “So asking for everyone to be black in honor is not a discrimination? ”
“No, it’s not, ” said Loving, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it was okay to ask for all to be black in honour, which she answered, “Absolutely. ”
Loving explained that it would be okay to replace a white person with a black person to “cultivate our specialty and different origins to create pride, solidarity, and support for one another. ”
McWilliams first filed a complaint on discrimination based on race in New York Firefight in January 2018.
He then appealed against Wilson, the firefighter of New York City, New York City, and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliam’s annulment, Wilson’s supporters have avenged and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have put hands on McWilliams and said: “I have heard about you, they told me that you would behave like that, and now you know who I am. ”
In an excerpt, Sullivan wrote that it would have been “happy ” to exclude McWilliams from honor at the Mass and that one thing was not applicable to the whole firefight.
“If you are a black person and discriminating against a white person at work, ” said Sullivan, “you are mostly reminded. ”
According to the prosecutor, Wilson was “advised for one hour ” because of her treatment with McWilliam.
In the meantime, a white person who discriminates against a black person receives “a severe punishment, ” wrote Sullivan.
“New York City’s fire has created a policy and process designed to please members of the Vulcan Society, who act in a racist manner, forgive their actions and help them ... and this has to be stopped,” wrote Sullivan.
Daunted a Walking Passor and Required Money
One was arrested in the city after a robbery attempt, endangering a walking walker and trying to get money from the person.
The man was saved in a prison cell.
Then a man with a knife was reported in the city center.
The knife was confiscated and reported by the person.
Over eighty cases came into the headquarters police board from 17 to 05 p.m. and were stored in a prison cell this morning.
Among other things, the police stopped a driver who drew a wheelchair at Kjalarnesi, where the wheelchair’s wheelchair was in a very bad condition.
The wheelchair was still, and the owner intended to provide a transportation device to transfer it to the city.
Then the police stopped the production of drugs in the Urban.
Two were arrested for the case and were released after the recording.
There was also a announcement of individuals who fire fireworks in the Urban.
When the police came to the place, they had already left the scene, “the shame is likely to be known to them, where it is still quite a long time at the end of the year. ”
Thousands of Khabarovsk’s inhabitants still demand the resignation of Putin
Thousands of the city's inhabitants were hosted by the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday and protested the arrest of the governor in the constituent province, south in the eastern Russian country, and the inauguration of his successor, who has never lived in the province.
The former governor, Sergei Furgal, enjoyed great popularity, and tens of thousands of citizens protested when he was arrested and put in custody in Moscow earlier this month, accused of having ordered murder in three businessmen fifteen years ago.
In the recent week, Furgal was formally replaced by his 39 - year - old brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, who had little impression of the locals.
Is Degtaryev said to be inexperienced and, worse, without any connection to Khabarovsk and called the inhabitants after his abduction.
Degtaryev’s calls have been overwhelmed by the ears.
Yesterday protestors were fewer than in the first protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: the liberation of Furgal and the resignation of Vladimir Pútin, President of Russia.
“We want the governor to be released, because we think his arrests are highly likely to be unlawful, ” the AFP news office after 30 years of protest, Alina Slepovu.
She claims that Kremlers had Furgal arrested “to protect their own interests, not the interests of the province. ”
In spite of the cloudless violation of the current observance of meetings for the Korean virus epidemic, the police in Khabarovsk kept Protestants free of harassment.
In Moscow, however, the police arrested at least ten people assembled at Pushkin Square to show protesters in Khabarovsk support in action, says the British Guardian report.
The Furgal Group, the Free Democracy Group of Russia, is a group of hardline nationalists, and is considered to be somewhat loyal to the Kremlar Government in most cases.
However, the same political reporters report that the victory of Furgal in the Governor’s elections two years ago — which was great and uncircumcised — was a significant shock for Pútin and United Russia, while suggesting that the powers of Crems in the eastern provinces were weakening.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and moved to Moscow, where he awaits trial.
He is accused of ordering three murders between 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were slain, and the third went out.
Sarah Rainsford, reporter of BBC, Moscow, says that Furgal’s followers, who enjoy great popularity at home, are convinced that the accusation and arrest have political roots.
They want to know why the government has waited with him until now," says Rainsford, 15 years after his alleged offense.

Homeless women with disabilities are involved in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman trained as a dresser, visits 250 homes every day to diagnose people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large Covid site in Chennai, where there have been about 10,000 cases.
She starts working early at 7:30, and ends at 4:00 p.m.
It measures the heat of the inhabitants, asks for symptoms, and teaches them the importance of using masks, washing their hands regularly, and keeping them away from others.
In fact, her work has led to the diagnosis and treatment of contamination in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of the 16,000 people of Chennai City who do their homes but are not health professionals.
According to the authorities, the project has contributed to a reduction in positive cases by 50 percent, in the daily count of Chennai, while increasing in other regions of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says not all of the inhabitants are cooperative.
She adds: “Most people cooperate when a woman with disabilities approaches them.
Some, though, become irritated.
But this is not to worry about.
I think people should be safe.
When I come back the next day, the people are polite.
It helps to build a good relationship."
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the city's gistimate for women with disabilities and fight against Covid-19 teams.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, also with disabilities, has also participated in the campaign as a supervisor.
Although Cavitha has a specially equipped wheel, she walks to meet people and holds her chickens.
“ I’m happy, ” she says about the reduction in infection, but she adds: “I want to see them go down to maybe 100 a day.
I'm sure we can make it."
On the first floor of the gistimate where the two live, Matilda Funceca, a basketball woman using a wheelchair, and Manimekalai, a teacher, and they send all the data from about 40 women into the Chennai City web site.
Matilda says she is not afraid to be infected with the corona virus.
“ When we help others, ” she adds, “God protects us. ”
When Manimekalai is asked what measures she will take, she says: “I use a mask, keep away, and often wash my hands.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a siddha drink that promotes the immune system."
A few months ago, when the crown virus first arrived at Chennai, these disabled women spent their time and skills sewing masks for health care professionals in the city.
As Dr. Aishwarya Rao and the director of the gistry, as well as the Dorcas study station, said: “They will adjust to the needs of each hour.
In the past there was a lack of masks, and they did not leave behind.
Now is the time to intervene in society, and they answered the call."
Tamil Nadu’s coronavirus infection has now reached 200,000 after 6989 new cases in the last 24 hours, but the most commonly reported number of infections is also reported on one day, according to official data.
Eighty - nine have died and 7758 have recovered within 24 hours.
The total number of diseases in the country is now 206,737.
Police are trying to reach the last trip of a teenager in Helensburgh
Investigators investigating the death of a teenage player in Helensburgh are now trying to set up a timeline for his last trips.
The body of 19 - year - old Kirk Allan was found in a home in Johnson Court about 6:25 a.m. on Saturday.
A 30 - year - old man was arrested, and on Sunday the police confirmed that he had now been charged with death.
He'll be in court at Dumbarton on Monday.
Inspector Steve Martin said: “Our mind is with Kirk’s family and friends in these difficult times.
Police will continue to work with society and support it.
Our studies are looking forward to getting a full picture of what happened, especially of Kirk's journeys in the last days of his death, but we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death."
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox tell about their experience of discrimination
The last few weeks have become clear that many skeletons are still in the closet in relation to racial rights in sports in South Africa.
Upbuilding conversations need to take place, and action must be taken to welcome everyone in sports.
Ashwell Prince, former cricket star at Proteas, told his white former teammates about it and accused them of racial prejudice by saying that he and other black teammen were “cotplayers. ”
Prince said that Proteas’ black players were officially called “cotplayers ” of their white teammates.
He added that it would be sad that even though black players such as Machaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada had the highest scores in sport, some people still associated them with the quota talk.
Prince, now the coach of the Cape Cobras team, had this comment fallen at the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisations (UCSCBO) on Thursday night.
The aim of the organizations is to continue the fierce discussion of historical racial rights in South African sports.
“ As I said when I lightened up on social media, it is not my intention to come and drag people's names into the field, but this is a real incident...
“ You’re doing everything right, but you’re getting infected ”
Paul Roberts, a former musician and carpenter who became a programmer at NASA, now works for a software company.
He and his wife, former nurse at the Methodist Hospital who considers themselves a optimist, kept out a hobby magazine on the Internet and attended Comic Con events earlier in years.
Once a week, they're busting them with their two daughters, their son-in-law, and their 7-year-old grandchildren, and they're playing a sexy Uno game.
“ They are amazing nerds, ” says 38 - year - old Roman, about their parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65 years old, is aware of the dangers of the epidemic — her diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put her at increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a corneal vein that has previously been blocked.
“ We’ve been so careful, very careful, and stay away from people, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband began working away from home this spring, when the epidemic struck hard on the Washington State, New York and other areas across the country.
Paul has occasionally gone to a supermarket in “old days, ” and their only real date during the past months was, according to Sheryl, when they began to check wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter was also careful.
Then, on the middle of June, she sneezed home from work and felt that she was allergic.
Soon she had cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea and lost all taste and smell, which are typical symptoms of the corona virus.
She said: “I don’t know what's going on, Mom, but I had a mask, had gloves, washed my hands, ” Sheryl said.
“ You do everything right, but you get infected. ”
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with positive corona virus viruses, did not become severely ill.
Yet, her parents had a much worse situation.
Paul Roberts and his wife began to sneeze and then cough, like their daughter, and then suffered warmth and pain in the body.
Then he became “very sick, very quickly, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
On June 22, he was confused.
She was worried about his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency reception, for the second time in two days.
The former royal couple felt “ignored ” in the Queen’s Christmas talk, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Bretaprin found their grandmother, British Queen, “reverting ” them in their Christmas talk.
The New Life Story of the couple, “Finding Freedom, ” shows that they were found to be overlooked by those in the gallery that appeared in the Christmas talk.
Pictures on the desk at which the queen sat, among other things, showed William Bretaprin, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl Bretaprin, and Camilla’s wife, as well as Prince Philip.
But Meghan and Harry were nowhere to see, despite Archie’s birth in May, but the boy was referred to as her Majesty’s “daughter of grandchildren. ”
The new book, published in August, also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton “ never were friends ” because they “have difficulty in getting past superficial politeness ” and only met a few times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that the conflict between Harry and his brother Wilhelm began some years before his relationship with Meghan began, but that it reached a climax because of Willlm’s and Kate Middleton’s marriage.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was a “sharp ” at events with his brother and Kate Middleton, and it is said that “he wanted to change things long before Meghan came to history. ”
The Conservatives accuse workers’ leaders of wanting to keep officials “home forever. ”
The Conservatives accuse workers' leaders of wanting public workers to be “world forever, ” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work
Activity officers were accused of wanting staff to “keep at home forever ” after protesting Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work.
Congressmen of the Conservation Team were angry when the public and public workers told their fellow workers to kick their feet when their commanders ordered them to return to their workplaces.
Andrew Percy, former minister, said “unacceptable ” that the necessary public service, such as the version of passports, was stopped while the public market staff had worked hard to keep society walking in the crown virus epidemic.
“ It is unacceptable that people refuse to return to their work while the workers of warehouses and factorys throughout the country have continued to work so that official staff can eat during this period, ” he said.
“ Many of these employees now want to go on vacation but can’t do it because of the people who refuse to go back to their workplaces, although safe.
Employee officers cannot maintain this policy of staying at home forever – especially now when we know that people can return to work safely."
At the request of the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, the newly appointed manager of the public service, announced that the Ministry should “revert the work of officials from their homes and speed up their return to their workplaces until August 1. ”
The public and public work community expressed their fellow workers, counting about 2000,000, that they did not have to comply with this requirement, and that this is about politics.
A spokesman of the Labour Society of Public and General Staff, the largest work community in Britain, said that the requirement to return to workplaces was “not presented by the health and safety of our social partners, or to strengthen the economy.
This is simply done because of political pressure from the Conservatives who demand that public service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to fellow workers is clear: If you do your work at home and someone in your department asks you to come back to the workplace, do not take it that, of course, you need to do it."
The issue is due to growing dissatisfaction with the late release of passports because employees work at home, but about 4000,000 people are now said to be waiting for their application to be completed.
The Ministry of the Internal Affairs has now announced that it will “seek to speed up” applications from the UK for travel in the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport release for more than four weeks.
The public and public staff association has acknowledged that some have had to wait up to 143 days for passports, but maintains that “little and often narrow offices” make it difficult for 4000 staff of the viscist service to keep the necessary distance.
The former government minister, David Davis, urged the leaders of a trade union to “behave sensibly ” and to seek ways of cooperating with governments to get people back into their workplaces.
He added that if he was in a government, he would ask a labor officer: “What do you want people to be home all summer? ”
However, some of the largest companies in Britain have ignored Johnson’s recommendation to return to work.
A study of larger jobs with a total of about 400.000 employees revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
Highlighting on History can play an important role in peace
The gap has expanded, but understanding and reconciliation should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this shortage of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught by Australian history.
The fact is that without radical action, the only teaching article that specifically deals with our history — “Australia Story ” before the 12th grade — will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in the Victorian State completed a study in Australia’s history of a total of 49,324 graduates, or just 1%.
Over the past six years, this number has almost fallen by half, but nearly 100 fewer students are enrolled every year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about Australia’s 12th grade history is that little has been done in the past years to interest them.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls within the wider “science. ”
Therefore, students in the 7th and 8th grade only complete one brief unit on “the originals and islands of Torres and their culture. ”
During the 9th and 10th years, Australia has another unity in world wars.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is taught about Australia’s history during the early school years.
During the 9th and 10th years, another optional unit is 1750-1918.
It is important to take three steps to save Australian history in Victoria’s schools.
First, history must become an independent study article such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is taught only as part of mind science, it has little room in the study schedule.
It is usually taught by people who have a general education in mind science but have not educated in history.
Historical skills such as the analysis of information are complex.
To ensure that such skills are taught in an accessible and exciting way, we must employ more specialized historians.
Third, Australia’s history from 1788 to 1914 must become obligatory.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s history in the 12th year of study, since they would have had to learn the material from the ground.
Knowledge of history alone and seeing a bridge does not deepen racial gaps.
But without it, as we can see clearly in the Victorian Bible study program, the project is hopeless.
Dr. Matthew Bach is a Senator of Freedom in the Victorian Congress and the former Deputy Head of Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar.
Aaron Elis in a European Seat Championship — Isaac in half a game
Aaron Elis Threshold Son has come to the final game of European seats in the Danish High School of Soccer.
Isaac Bergmann Johnson played only the first half with the peak of Norrköping against the bottom of Falkenberg, Sweden.
Aaron Elis was on OB’s team in Denmark when the team continued to play a final game of seats in the European Championship.
The OB will meet the AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, which depends on the end of the teams upwards after the final cycle of the top of the Danish election department later today.
Aaron Elis played the whole game with Horsens at the end of the day, with the OB winning the first game of the teams in the home field, 3-1, and thus won a total of 4-2.
Isaac was in the beginning of the North Creation, which was unexpectedly 2 – 0 below after the first half-play against the Falkenberg troops in the Swedish elections department.
At the beginning of the second half - game, North Creation was one of those who had to deviate.
Norrköping scored, but Falkenberg reached 3-2 over 89 minutes.
However, there was still a time for Norrköping to recover from hell at the last moment, 3-3.
Norrköping remains on top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elf City, and five points ahead of Malmö, who plays for good later today.
For now, Falkenberg was able to get off the bottom, but there is a step above Helsingborg and Kalmar who plays a good game.
Gathering Documents on the National Festival in the Chronavirus Times
Anna Lilja Winning Daughter set up the Facebook group “My National Festival 2020” to gather papers about the festival of the islands that will be held next weekend.
Many are going to camp in their gardens and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja spoke to hvata in the series Helgen at the Wave.
“ There is nothing yet that is very exciting, too, because there are 600 people in the group, so people are clearly going to do something, ” says Anna Lilja.
There's something about the islanders going to have tent parties at home in a garden.
“ People have talked about having their own [festival], perhaps tenting in the garden, and hobbing the family together, as people always do at that time, ” says Anna.
“ You assume that you will spend time with your people.
However, she is likely to say that many will simply not be present, “but still to celebrate a little National Festival somewhere else. ”
The National Festival Committee is now working hard to repay the tickets purchased, but Anna thinks that many locals are more likely to secure tickets for the next year’s festival.
“Men are even investing in the tickets now and are allowed to apply by 2021. ”
“ I am a great National Festival, love the preparation, and all around it, but sometimes something comes into life that you do not control, and that’s just how it is, ” says Anna, but according to the fact that people have been asking whether the Islands can’t release the National Festival “such once. ”
Anna Lilja claims that she has not established the group for herself or to encourage people to hold their own National Festival, but to collect information about the Festival of Trade in the Islands this year.
“ What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in something or anything but then someone who uses such sources in something but I was just creating some area where people can install what they're doing."
At the same time, a fire has been uploaded on the Incorporation, which is turned on every year.
“ I think many people are excited to get burned on Friday evening.
The only thing that, of course, makes a point in the account is that the prediction is nothing specific."
“ This burn will be incinerated, ” says Anna Lilja, “but it just needs to be found how it will be. ”
You can listen to the interview with Anna Lilja as a whole in the player below.
Will Prince Andreas be mentioned in new documents on sexual offences?
The British Royal Family now prepares for responding to possible new information in legal documents on his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A U.S. Judge has ordered that secret documents on Epstein and Maxwell be made public.
Among these 80 pages of documents are parts with Maxwell’s testimony from 2016
The display of these pages could also put great pressure on Prince Andreas where there is communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, a claimed sex slave of the scorned American financer, claimed in 2015 that she had been forced to interact with Prince Andreas.
Prince Andreas now prepares for defending the possible publication of information this week with even more damaging accusations of his friendship with the child abuser Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged co-worker, Ghislaine Maxwell.
The U.S. district judge Loretta Preska ordered the publication of 80 secret legal documents in connection with Maxwell and Epstein, which count hundred pages.
The display of these tremendous documents would be shocking for 58 - year - old Maxwell, where they have large portions to store with her witness to lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be “inclusive questions ” about her sexual history.
They could also put great pressure on Prince Andreas, where one of the documents contains communications between Maxwell and Epstein as of January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, meant the sex slave of the scorned American financial agent, claimed in 2015 that she had been forced three times to interact with Andrew.
Andrew has repeatedly rejected these claims.
E-mail from 2015, which has been leaked and BBC published last year, seems to indicate that Andrew asked Maxwell to help with Robert’s claims.
We have no doubt that the Duke will be revolted
There he said to the superior woman: “Let me know when we can talk, and I have some questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell replied, “I have information, and call me when you have time. ”
Last night, a related source of Andrew said: “The captain of Jorvík has done nothing wrong, so we are not worried about the opening of legal documents.
As the U.S. courts have tried to point them out, this does not mean that a accusation is true if it is presented in legal documents.
The U.S. courts have encouraged the media and the public to take full care of the accusations presented in the legal documents.
We fully agree with that.
We have no doubt that the Duke will be fully rebelled in the next few weeks."
Maxwell is now in custody in Manhattan, waiting for a trial to find and lure some of the victims of Epstein who were under the law from 1994 to 1997.
She is also accused of sanctions for refusing to report his abuse.
She rejects all the accusations.
Maxwell last spoke with lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Robert’s head of injury, now under the surname of Giuffre, which she recorded after marriage.
Some 40 pages of 418 were made public last year, but after the decision of the judge Presna of New York last week, more parts could be opened first on Thursday.
Maxwell’s lawyers were given one week to make an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in New York last year when he was in court for sexual offence.
Detectives are looking for a gang for violent attacks on Edinburgh streets
Three attacked a man in Edinburgh and hurt him, which could prove permanent.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked in Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 a.m. on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been taken to the royal hospital with serious injuries.
Detective Dale Miles, in charge of the investigation, said: “It was a violent and relentless attack. ”
The suspects escaped to Newtoft Street.
One of them was considered to be in his 40 ’ s, about 180 cm high, and heavily grown.
He was short - cut and dark - haired in a white shirt, dark pants, and dark shoes.
Detective Miles said: “I pray to all those in this area when the attack was made and saw something suspicious about surrendering. ”
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland.
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the U.S. Ambassador of Iceland, wants to carry a gun here on the land and wants to increase security.
He is said to have been “a paranoid ” about his safety since his arrival last year.
This is noted in the CBS report, which also states that this is what Gunter wants, despite his work in “one of the safest kingdoms in the world. ”
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ask the Icelandic government to carry a gun.
Then he has asked for a armored car and a vest to protect him from stabbing.
However, CBS’ sources say that the Department has repeatedly announced to Gunter that he is not at risk in Iceland.
CBS reports that the State Department of Foreign Affairs did not provide information on whether a request was received from the United States for Gunter’s potential armaments, because the authorities did not express themselves on the security measures of foreign foreigners.
Although no request was made, the sources of the news office say that there was no request.
Then, too, CBS has it since his sources were told that Gunter should not want to carry a weapon, because it would be taken as offense here in the country.
Gunter is an unerfaren ambassador who has been a skin disease doctor in California for years.
He's active in the United States Republic of America, and he's a powerful supporter of President Donald Trump.
He recently attracted attention here in the country when he cried about the “invisible China Virus. ”
CBS’ sources also say that Gunter was seriously depressed by the U.S. ambassador in Reykjavik.
He already had seven second - commanded staff in the Embassy since May of last year.
Among other things, he has accused them of belonging to the “Deep Empire, ” which is to be the network of American officials working against Trump, and he resented the fact that one was carrying snow into his office.
The ambassador traveled to Washington DC in February before a conference and refused to return to Iceland for a few months, according to CBS.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but eventually Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Minister, had to order him to return and did so in May.
The home game form is key to Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has easier games to play when his fans get back in a game.
With Jose Mourinho’s help, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game in the homefield since the excellence department started again, but he says that it would be much easier to maintain a good team at home if the audience were allowed to play.
Questions have won 12 wins at home during this season, but they have lost four times — only one of the six teams above them has lost more in the home field.
The coach Portuguese said that even if such a victory was possible without the fans, it would be easier to maintain it if they were there.
“We have to do this with the fans, ” he said, “without them a fortress of some kind can be built.
“ But I think it would be much more powerful to do it with the fans, because it adds to the emotional side of the game, which is only achieved by fans at the home stadium. ”
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitors, it will be increasingly difficult to maintain the long triumph periods in his homefield from Chelsea, or Liverpool, who have built up the last three seasons.
However, this is also a key factor in determining whether the past reaches its goals at the end of the period, especially in matching games and neighboring laws, where the atmosphere of the field can make a difference.
“ I believe the policy of the excellence department is that it is now becoming increasingly difficult to beat this unsatisfactory record, because the past has become good. ”
“ On the other hand, it is important to be strong in the home field and have at the end of the season brought in a number of ladders with wins in home games. ”
“ I’m pleased with the finals of home games recently, without fans, but we need them back.
I can imagine a victory against Arsenal with the field full of Tottenham fans.
It's a feeling that's built up gradually."
Buyers excited about the desired style of life in Lovely Banks
“ Greater is better, ” is evidently the motto of new owners of huge property in Lovely Bank’s neighbourhood, which was recently sold at $1270 Australian dollars.
Interesting buyers in search of lifestyles near the centre of Geelong went to explore this 1.35 acres land, where 14 cars, pools and views of the Corio Bay can be found.
Joe Grgic, a real estate vendor in Harcourts, North-Geelong, said that an offer in the land that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of its placing on the market.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove back to sale
Home Options for Isolation
“We received a number of offers from various parties, ” said Grgic.
“The property was sold to a homeman who is very excited. ”
The land is accompanied by four two - floor rooms, including a special bath room large enough to bed a sofa.
The new owners have a choice of three rooms and can use a kitchen and update an outdoor area with a view over the pool.
“This was how the property was composed, that it was three fields, and that it was in this place, ” said Grgic.
“ There were interested buyers from Melbourne who wondered what the property was in the middle but still in the countryside.
“ I have people who missed and buyers who are still looking. ”
He said that the wider storage area, which includes a double garage and a free - standing shelter of 10-12 vehicles, is perfect for industrialists or for the storage of wheelchairs and trailers.
Counting its security threatened in Iceland
“ Despite being appointed as one of the safest lands in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been paranoid about his safety since he arrived in Reykjavik last year. ”
This is how the CBS News begins a detailed discussion of the U.S. ambassador in Iceland, which imitates a number of CBS records from the U.S. Foreign Service.
CBS claims that Gunter requested to the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs that he would be given special permission to the Icelandic authorities to carry firearms.
Then he should also have asked for an armored car, as well as for ideas about a vest that could protect him from stabbing.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to state publicly whether Gunter’s safety is really threatened in Iceland, but according to information from officials, Gunter has been repeatedly expressed that he is not in any special danger.
Nevertheless, the U.S. embassy in Iceland recently announced after full - time lifeguards, including the Morning newspaper of July 18, but CBS’ records simulate that it is done to seduce Gunter’s concerns.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not express itself on a number of safety measures related to its ambassadors, but always states the objective of preventing security.
The Ministry does not answer questions regarding Gunter's wish to arm and the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not want to say whether the United States formally requested that the ambassador bear a gun, and usually claims not to express itself on the security issues of foreign agencies.
However, CBS notes that the request was never made, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was deprived of these plans, where they could offend the locals in Iceland.
CBS also discusses the various problems that have been adhering to the United States Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will have already replaced his warehouser seven times.
Thus, the first Deputy Minister is said to have prepared for his work for a long time and learned Icelandic only in order to have been denied the position at the last moment because Gunter "does not find him" at their first meeting.
His successors haven't been much better under Gunter's control.
The governments of the United States Department of Foreign Affairs are told to be aware of the position of the Embassy in Iceland, but are reluctant to intervene in close affairs of the President.
In addition to all this, Gunter is told to refrain from following the various rules of the foreign service and respecting the order of power.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in a Washington conference, and it is said that he has refused to return to Iceland afterward, leaving his temporary surrogate for months, in the middle of a pandemic.
Will Gunter even have wanted to do his work in remote work and claimed not to return to Iceland unless the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, specifically asked for it?
According to information from the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take personal permission at the end of the conference and the crown virus epidemic delayed his journey further, but according to CBS, many within the Ministry have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, which he did not until May, after Pompeo contacted him and asked him to return to the Embassy in Iceland.
The CBS review also reports the impopulations of Gunters in Iceland, especially in connection with the thwarts, where he calls the coron virus “the invisible China virus ” and has been highly criticized.
Gunter is one of a number of almost inexperienced ambassadors appointed during the reign of President Donald Trump of the United States.
Sachin Pilot against Ashok Gehlot; the Bharatiya Janata Group says government crisis in the state; the Congress Group wants vote payment
Ashok Gehlot said that if this was needed, the Congress Group would have to hold a session conventioner outside the home of the Prime Minister.
On Saturday, the day after a peaceful protest against Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister Rajasthan, said that if it was necessary, congressmen would have to meet the president and material to speak outside the home of the Prime Minister to bring the crisis into the state.
At the Congress Council meeting, Gehlot indicated that it was planned to hold a vote to check whether the majority of the members of the Senate and his co-ordinates were in the power struggle.
“ He said the government had a majority and wants to vote, ” says Mahesh Joshi’s statement after the meeting.
The meeting was held at a hotel, where the Senate supporters of Gehlot have remained in the last days.
“ The Prime Minister asked us to be prepared to stay longer in the hotel.
If necessary, he said, he would meet the President and also hold peaceful protests outside the home of the Prime Minister," said a party leader.
Mr Rajasthan's Prime Minister can summon the Congress together and let the Congress party demonstrate its majority, said on Friday, class leader Rahul Gandhi, suggesting that the plan of the Bharatiya Janata group was to cast Ashok Gehlot's government off the chair.
“ The country is now governed by the law and constitution.
Governments are formed and operate with the public authority.
The plan of Bharatiya Janata to cast the government of Rajasthan has been discovered.
This is an offense of 80 million people in Rajasthan.
The Prime Minister must convene the Congress to bring the truth before the country," said Gandhi in the thunder of Hindu.
On Saturday, Mr Gehlot, Prime Minister of Rajasthan, told congressmen that he was prepared to go to a meeting of the President of India to ensure that what he calls "Bharatiya Janata's intentions" about delaying a declaration of trust by voting will not succeed.
Gehlot, who protested for hours at the home of the governor Kalraj Mishra on Friday to press for a meeting, met with congressmen and government on Saturday and after the meeting, new proposals were constructed and agreed by government.
Mishra asked Gehlot last night to return the session request and referred to six objections.
The proposal will soon be sent to the governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of delaying the meeting, where he is “under pressure” to delay the vote that determines the trust of his government.
When Gehlot met his government, the Bharatiya Janata ambassador meeting the leader of Satish Poonia and the leader of the government opposition Gulab Chandra Kataria with the governor to discuss the position of COVID-19 in the state.

The actress Spencer Grammer given a channel outside the Manhattan restaurant
NEW YORK – The actress Spencer Grammar said that he was trying to calm an excited man when he cut her arm and stabbed her friend in her back outside the restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammer, 36 years old, told US Weekly that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation as they had been trying to prevent the situation from getting worse when attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend sat at dinner at the outdoor table at The Black Ant in the East Villagetown of Manhattan at 23:30
on Friday, when a man came up to them, and demanded to be paid, the restaurant was being closed.
Grammer and her friend were injured when they tried to “resolve a conflict between an unknown man and other local guests, ” according to the police.
The man ran off the ground after wounding Grammer's right arm and stabbed her friend into the back with an unknown sharp object, said the police.
No one's been arrested.
Grammer, who speaks for Summer in the "Rick and Morty" shows and played in the "Greek" series of ABC Family, is the daughter of the "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer and the actor Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said that both her and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered severe internal injuries, she said.
In a declaration to US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who responded at the scene and the staff of the Bellevue Hospital who listened to them and mentioned the “fabulous battle ” of this staff in the crown virus epidemic.
“ We were deeply touched by the opportunity to thank them personally, ” Grammer said.
“ I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic evening on UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now named as the next star of UFC after enrolling in the history of Fight Island, but he says that he is not heading for exaggerating his wealth in an arrogant way, like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev carried the North Irish Rhys McKee's superpower in their battle in a volatile Abu Dabi on Saturday night when he defeated his competitor when three minutes and nine seconds were gone out of the first round by blowing him down on the floor.
The winner recorded the name Chimaev in UFC’s history for the shortest time between winners in modern history, where only 10 days had passed since he defeated British John Phillips in a similarly decisive way.
Chimaev, who has a winning rate of 8-0, received a bonus of $50,000 for the evening’s performance against McKee and has so fully captured the attention of the MMA world that it is now called “Khalib 2.0”, which can be said to be an inevitable comparison because of the great probability between Chimaev’s superiority and the UFC master in lightweight and where he is born in Technenia, near the homely Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite the newly found fame and financial gain, the translated Chimaev has said that he would not be willing to flag his wealth like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his peer in the box world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I’m not just doing this for myself, I’m doing it for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or something like that.
I want to help people," answered Chimaev when he was asked at Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
Among other things, he has noticed Conor McGregor’s teammate and the active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social label that he could “easily ” defeat Chimaev with a handout.
It did not stand in a poisonous response from the warrior under the name “Borz, ” or“ wolf ” in his native language, who said that he would “male Danis with his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, who is now in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the country when he is 19 years old, may not be in favour of his financial power, but he is evidently reluctant to clothe his martial skills.
“ I can grind anyone...

Israel continues to object to Prime Minister’s Reactions at Pandemic Pandemics
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israel protested against the Prime Minister in many parts of the country on Saturday and were the largest protests outside the official residence of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for a few weeks, but they began because critics believe that the government neglects to respond to the crown virus epidemic after having at first managed to keep the threat of the virus under control.
Prosecutions against Netanyahu for corruption have further promoted the protests.
“ Bibi, go home, ” stood on a sign of the Protestants.
On another board, “All see that the emperor has lost his clothes. ”
Hundreds of Protestants also gathered outside Netanyahu’s coastal house in Caesarea’s wealthy town.
Last week, the police used water guns to scatter groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called the rapid and unorganized reopening of economic life in May, the average number of new cases per day increased to 2000.
The country's economy has been struck by the limitations caused by the virus and unemployment has grown to almost 20%.
Protestants say that the government’s financial assistance was nowhere near enough.
The protests took place in a shadow of the court of corruption charges against Netanyahu, which began again during the month.
Interrogation begins in January.
He is accused of betrayal, disloyalism, and bribery in order of scandal.
Hundreds of Protestants gathered in the middle of Los Angeles to show unity with Protestants in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – About 300 Protestants met in the middle of Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon for the support of two - month - old movements in Portland, Oregon, where attention was drawn to federal police officers after fighting with Protestants.
Similar protest meetings were held throughout the United States, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The protests in Los Angeles were organized by the groups Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front.
The team went to the headquarters of the LAPD on First Street and Main Street and then to the center of the city area.
The participants also moved over to the Alameda departure at Route 101 but left it later.
Parts of the people were seen breaking windows in federal buildings in the center of town, and misunderstandings were written on public markings.
At least one person was arrested in the protests.
50 men in mosquitoes at the Eid Festival, and no prayers in Eidgah, says the government of Karnataka.
The festival Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, takes place on July 31 and August 1st.
The authorities of Karnataka have announced that only 50 can be gathered in mosques for the sake of Eid-ul-Azha, and have forbidden prayer meetings at Eidgah and other places for the crown virus epidemic.
Guests who wish to pray in mosquitoes must have masks and keep them away, according to the order of AB Ibrahim, Ministerial Director of Minorities and Wakf.
The Order states that the Hilal Committee decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also called or Bakrid, was held on 31 July in the provinces Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodaga, and on 1 August in other parts of the State.
The prescription states that even if prayer meetings are one of the most important rituals of Muslims at the Bakrid festival, such events will be banned at Eidgah and other places because of the COVID-19 epidemic.
However, prayers will be allowed in mosquitoes provided that there are no more than 50 people involved at a time.
If there are more than the time of prayer, says the Ministry of Justice in the directive.
Prayer meetings may not be held anywhere else, such as meeting houses, social centres or “Shadi Mahal, ” as stated.
The Karnataka governments allow temples, mosquitoes and other prayers to be opened to those who want to pray since June 8, provided that they are well protected for the purpose of COVID-19.
The American Ambassador wants an armed bodyguard.
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the U.S. Ambassador of Iceland, thinks his life is threatened here and wants to carry weapons.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. Embassy repeatedly advertised by bodyguards in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to the evidence of Knick, the main reason why these jobs were advertised is that Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter thinks his life is threatened in Iceland.
A light has been discussed with sources in Iceland and abroad who tell the ambassador that he is in great danger, and the reason is that he is Jewish.
What the threat is, is not as clear, but Clusters said that Islamic terrorists had been called a threat.
The TV station CBS discussed the matter on its web this morning and notes that Gunter is insane, demands to carry his own weapons, to get a stunning vest, and to be armed alongside a bulletproof car.
According to CBS, Gunter has repeatedly been told that there is no threat and that the "body Guard" advertisement is only for sleeping Gunter.
By the end of June, the positions were not determined by the Cluster, but an application deadline ran out to February.
According to the evidence of Clumsy, the US Embassy has not received a formal case for these changes.
No formal request has been made for an increased care or for a warrant for lifeguards to walk armed outside the ambassador’s walls.
Icelandic law is decisive that this is not allowed except with special authorization from the governor.
Reasoners in the control system say there is no information on any kind of threat.
The latest risk assessments by the Governor are somewhat decisive to threats of terrorism.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and there is no evidence that terrorist or extreme groups are working here.
The prerequisites for authorising the arms of a foreign embassy in the streets of cities and towns in Iceland are not available, according to the sources of Cluster.
Gunter attracted considerable attention here in the country when he shared the championship of the United States President and called the COVID-19 “China Virus. ”
Then he had the American and Iceland flag.
A radioman in Seattle who mocked Trump's reaction to protests says he has to get a gun after Starbucks café beneath his apartment was destroyed — RT USA News
Paul Gallant has gained a new perspective on violent protests after blaspheming the United States President Donald Trump in June for saying that anarchists were burning and robbed Seattle City.
The only thing that had to be done was to move closer to the participant’s home.
“ I feel like I need to buy a gun, because this will clearly continue to happen, ” said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that savages had “destructed ” the Starbucks café at the bottom floor of his house.
“ That's enough, it looks like a street party down the street from me.
The difference was quite different when Trump complained last month that the mayor of Seattle was allowing violent Protestants to take over the city.
“These liberal Democrats have no sense, ” said the president.
“ The terrorists burn and rob our cities, and they find it just wonderful, even death. ”
Gallant, a co-ordinator of the “Danny & Gallant ” project at the Seattle Co-operation Radio ESPN, replied:“ Go through there for curiosity last night and did not see any burning, robbery, or death.
Gallant said last night the police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks café.
He showed pictures of the damage and said, “Goodly done, you idiots, ” and said that he had also seen fire a few blocks away.
"I have no idea what's going on, but we're going to find out to the cat."
The reverse did not pass people who mocked Gallant for his previous opinion and threw messages such as “Just Relax Lax, ” and “Jah, maybe Trump was right. ”
Jason Rantz, another radioman in Seattle, said: “I don’t think we’ll finally go on this viewing trip that we discussed. ”
Gallant went along with the joke: “Woke up and saw that a lot of people were whipping, “Slap in the salmon, ” I laughed. ”
He said he stood up to his previous claim where he had walked through the CHAZ Automated Area of Anarkists and though it wasn't as bad as it had been declared as.
“ So it was burned and robbed after all, ” he said. “ Judgment made. ”
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, searching for apartments with his 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, started together at the scene of the White Lines, which dealt with the sighing and boasting of Ibiza, but during the past week their appearance was different and calmer, far from the party life.
The couple who plays a sibling in the Netflix series were seen viewing a magnificent countryside in Oxfordshire, which is for sale at £1.2 million.
They came to the Range Rover area, which Laura, 34, drove, dressed with jeans and a white shirt, and met a real estate vendor that led them to a visit to the five - room house.
In the White Lines last fall, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who met the darker side of Ibiza when she investigates the murder of her brother, Alex, who is played by Tom, 28 years old.
They did not discover their relationship until earlier in this month, less than a year after the end of the six-year marriage of Laura and Sam Claflin, but he is known from the Hunger Games movies.
Together, they have the four - year - old son, Pip, and the two - year - old daughter, Margot.
When they announced the divorce in August last year, Claflin, 34, wrote in Instagram: “I have decided to divorce Laura, with love, friendship, and deep respect for each other, and we will continue our cooperation in the training of our children.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 in an audition, and Sam, who has also played at Peaky Blinders, described their wedding in 2013 as “without delay one of the greatest achievements of my life. ”
Before Laura got her role in White Lines, she had played in the first Inb betweeners movie, and in the criminal drama The Capture of BBC, which was shown last year, where she played the lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom had a role in the second Inb betweeners movie and in the series Brittania from Sky.
Counts too early to claim about other waves here on the land
An expert in the field of health care in the local medical office says too early to claim the second wave of the epidemic.
Three new inland diseases were detected at the hospital’s virologic department yesterday, and a dozen of them have become sick.
Two internal infections were detected on Thursday, one in a man of thirty years and the other in a man of twenty years.
Then there had been no diagnosis since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, there were three more internal diseases, one of which had been at the Rey Cup football convention in Laugardal.
Johan K. Johannsson, a U.S. Marshal Intelligence Officer, says in a conversation with a news agency that fewer had to take a sample for that infection than was initially thought.
The second is the infection of a person who came to the country from abroad on July 15.
At that time, rules on the so - called home port had been applied.
However, Kamilla Rut Sigfusdaughter, an expert in the field of health care at the National Medical Office, says that he or she followed the old process.
His vision was negative when he arrived in the land, but he became sick, is in isolation, and six have been infested.
They're all on their way to a show, but two of them are starting to show symptoms.
The third infection is then related to the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and has been associated with it with 12 illnesses.
It has been found that there is a new variant of the corona virus that has not been detected in this country.
“ We don’t know exactly where these viruses come from, but we haven’t seen them before.
He who is believed to have carried the virus into the land had been in Israel, but also in other European countries."
It considers it too early to claim that the so - called second wave of the epidemic has begun in this country, just as other countries in Europe are afraid.
“ While the majority is still traceable, it is not deliberate.
But we're on our toes and we're watching, thinking about ways to fail if something like that could start."
Megan Fox expresses himself on the relationship.
Megan Fox says he found his twin soul in the machine gun Kelly.
“ As soon as I met him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I'm interested in starmarks, and I knew right away that my twin soul was about to be," says Fox, 34 years old.
“ Twin soul is when the soul has come to a sufficient degree of existence to divide it into two different bodies at the same time, ” explained Fox.
“ So, I think, we are two half the same soul.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away."
“ After we had known each other for two days, I asked him to meet me for lunch, and I taught him about the star signs and asked him into his life.
I decided to go to the depth immediately."
Machine Gun Kelly's in the same line, but they met with a movie.
“ I had started hanging outside her wheelchair, hoping to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
Just two months ago, Fox left his husband for ten years, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim.
The American musician, the tinchologulent, and President Kanye West have apologized to Kim Kardashian West for his public statement on family matters.
“ I want to apologize to my wife Kim for having discussed personal matters publicly, ” he wrote in the Twitter post last night.
While considering the situation of their relationship, Kanye has recently spent a lot of time in social media and during a mass meeting that he held last Monday, he discussed the birth of his daughter North West and claimed that he had almost killed her.
Then Kim came to Wednesday and published messages to her followers at Instagram, where she discussed her husband’s disease, who is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not previously communicated publicly about the husband’s illness, saying that it is, among other things, because of the children of their husbands and the rights of Kanye to privacy when he comes to his health.

Increased Pregnancy in Racist Protestants in the United States
Protestants have walked through the streets of many cities in the United States to draw attention to racial rights.
There have been protests for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd killed a police prisoner in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent federal police to Portland, which is still responsible for the protests.
Protestants now also object to the presence of the federal police officers in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, the police used flame bombs and tear gas and arrested 45 people after a protest conference to support the protests in Portland was dissolved in violence.
According to the police, more than 20 officers were injured.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was released into the Black Lives Matter demanding walk.
The media reports that the man may have walked up to a car with a rifle before he was shot.
“ The point is that it is horrible that someone dies in protests, ” said Mayor Steve Adler, in a statement.
Adler claimed to be “sworn and speechless. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in the case of Breonnu Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when the police broke into her home, with permission to enter without banking, and shot her.
Taylor's boyfriend had first shot to the police because he thought they were burglars.
One police officer has been fired for Taylor's death, but the other police officers have not been charged.
The NFAC group's predecessor, a armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in a police investigation on Taylor's murder.
According to the police, three members of the NFAC were injured on Saturday when accidentally fired by the rebel army.
Potential seal group infection
Five people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside the border.
Two of the infected were diagnosed with an unevident virus variant, and the origin of three of the five infections seems to be quite vague.
It is not true whether the individuals were infected by a returning tourist or the asymptomatic Iceland, who likely infected much more.
The surgical surgical surgeon says that a possible group infection may be in a seal in connection with one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 on the country last Thursday, with each type of virus.
The origin of the infection is still unclear.
Three were diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by one of those diagnosed on Thursday, one came to the country last 15 July and was probably infected outside, but the third one is also infected with a vague origin.
After a series of gene analyses, the two subjects diagnosed with the virus and associated have a new variant that has not been identified in this country.
Camilla Joseph’s daughter, a medical specialist in the field of health care, and a surrogate of a medical surgeon, says that an Icelandic gene analysis is now going over where is most likely that this type of virus came from.
“ The other case was similar to a virus that has been running in Switzerland but not exactly the same.
They're going to examine this and try to map it better and lead the likes out of which part of the infection comes," she says.
"This seems to be here on the side of the Atlantic."
Therefore, the infection is unrelated to the two who arrived early in July and were driven to the United States.
Are you going to assume that this new species is on the outside rather than being mutant in this country?
“ Yes, it’s different from what has been found here before that there’s really no chance that it was something wrong here, ” Kamilla answers.
“ There is every chance that these individuals have somehow come to a close contact with a person who has just arrived somewhere outside, without knowing it. ”
The question is that as yet, there is no evidence of where this new virus might have come from.
“ It could naturally be a traveler who has left the country again, but there may also be someone who does not have any symptoms and who does not realize that he has been infected and could naturally cause more infection.
We'll be on our toes the next few days to watch it."
“ At present, there is no clear group infection.
However, there are individuals who went to an epidemic in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and have already been sampled," Kamilla continues.
“ We have not yet reached the conclusions of them.
So it could possibly be a group infection in a seal."
Do you expect this to be a social centre now?
“ That is not impossible.
It has not been in the past, but it is not impossible because we do not know who has carried this infection in these individuals, who were diagnosed on Tuesday and yesterday."
Could it be said that this is now starting a new wave of the virus?
“ No, not yet.
But naturally, we need to be very alert, and we need to keep this in mind, even though there are so limited limits to how much of the vision we can take in people.
We do not take samples from unspecified people, but first that we are getting infections that seem unrecognizable, we need to be given a little more loose hands by taking samples from people with symptoms," she says.
Thus, in the next days, the hospital’s bacterial and virologic department can be expected to give in the samples to try to identify the situation in the country.
Does the Diamond have the ability to increase domestic displays and to carry out screenings at the border?
“ Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there needs to be some basis for taking a sample in individuals who are not in the screening work; the person must be in an illness and have symptoms or have had symptoms and suspected that he or she has been in touch with someone who has just arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
It states that the diseases identified yesterday are still in progress, and that there is now much work to do in obtaining information on the travels of individuals.
It says that the origin of the internal infection seems irreversible, but does not exclude that some of those who have now been infected can provide evidence that eventually leads the infectious team to the original infection.

Green was a member of this historic rock band, along with Mick and Jeremy Spencer.
Despite the fact that Green left the band in 1970, before reaching her peak with records such as Rumours, Mick has praised this former orchestra member and assured its fans that “his music will survive. ”
“For me and all the former and current Fleetwood Mac members it’s losing Peter Green a great memorial moment,” said Fleetwood in a conversation with PA.
“ Peter was the man who established Fleetwood Mac, along with me, John McVie, and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever joined Fleetwood Mac without deep respect for Peter Green and his talents, and the fact that the music is to shine brightly and be moved by unshakable passion."
“ Peter, I will miss you, but make sure your music will live, ” added the 73 - year - old rock star.

Prince Joakim Dana, the younger son of Margaret Thorhild, Queens of Danad, and Prince Henrik, are still in a hospital in Toulouse, France, where he was under surgery the previous day because of a blood clot in the brain.
The Danish State Radio, DR, notes the speaker of the Danish court that the length of the 51 - year - old Prince’s condition in the hospital is uncertain.
A report from D.R. explains that the blood clot is currently investigating the effects of the blood clot on the Prince’s health.
It is noted by the doctor Peter Qvortrup Geisling, who deals with the health of DR, that the consequences of a blood clot in the brain are often not observed until 24 hours after surgery.
“ It can be from negligible symptoms to death, memory problems, or problems with expression, ” says Geisling.
He says the prince could wait for months of rehabilitation.
Prince Joakim Dana, who is the full name of Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and also a Count of Monpezat, stayed on the family vineyard, Château de Cayx, in Southern France when he got sick on Friday night.
He was first taken to a hospital in Cahor, near the farm, and then moved to the University Hospital in Toulouse, where he underwent surgery because of a blood clot in the brain.
Google Pixel 4 can form the galaxy
Double optical attraction enables the extra lens of Pixel 4 to be seen in three dimensions and thus brings a better impact in the background with facial setting than in previous Pixel phones, which relied on the alpha software to achieve these so-called "bookeh" effects.
To demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google’s legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz was enrolled in a field to discuss his experience with Pixel 4 in the last 12 months.
Engine study is still in the foreground of all features of Google’s new smartphones, and on this phone, “computer-managed photography” is new to improve the HDR+ setting by merging up to nine different images.
New dual description controls offer different slides for lightness and shadow and enable users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also relies on engineering to offer better automatic whitening and an improved “Night Sight” night setting, which is so sensitive that it can capture the galaxy on the night sky.
In addition to another camera device, Pixel 4 Soli introduces “road-saw chips” on the front of the phone that detects the Motion Sense movements so that users can release a track, turn off time speeches, turn the alarm on the sleep, or turn off the sound of the phone by wavering the hand.
All the Motion Sense calculations are carried out in the device instead of connecting to the Internet, and the same applies to an improved Google helper, where the technician now stresses shortening response time and improving user privacy.
Google's continued emphasis on using its engineering capabilities fully has also resulted in a new voice recording app that rewrites live sounds without sending data to the Internet.
The app is available only in English, but more languages are expected.
Pixel 4 will also be the first phone that supports Google Stadia, the game scene in the cloud that will be released from the stocks of November 19, but still report the date for Australia.
In addition to new Pixel phones, Google also introduced new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and other generations Google Pixel Buds listening tools.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart hearing tools, which are expected to be next year, are completely wireless and have a sound adaptation that listens to the environment and consistently sets the sound to the greatest degree of clarity.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart hearing tools are completely wireless and set the volume according to the noise around you.
Google also announced an update of its conjugated Wi-Fi home bones in the Nest WiFi line with special bones, together with many bases working together to improve the wireless connection within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest name, doubles its predecessor and adds a built-in microphone and speaker to use the Google helper at each base station of the home.
It is sold in Australia on November 5th and costs 399 australian for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or $549 for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but the new 79 dollar Nest Mini improves the sound quality by double the base and has received a built-in wall mounting.
All Google smart speakers will get a new call system capabilities for communication between devices in the home, as well as the ability to call the Nest Mini outside the home using the Google Home app.

A fisherman “saving a bottle of beer in seal ” in Devon
According to a charity organization, a fisherman threw a bottle of beer into the seal when he disturbed the fishing line.
Images taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay seem to show a man on a rock that throws a piece towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the grey seal was hunting when the hunter emptied a bottle and threw it in the back of the animal.
Kenny called this “fare and unreasonable behavior. ”
He said he was picking up garbage in this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning, along with other people in Seal Project, when he witnessed the attack.
“The seller tried to get into the hunting line, ” he said.
“ The fisherman stretched the beer, emptied the bottle, and threw it in the seal.
"The liquid landed on the back of the seal and he swim off."
Teacher said that “fortunately, it was selling strong animals, ” but that the seller simply did what was inherent in him.
“ By throwing a bottle of glass into him, ” he said, “you stop him hunting. ”
The Seal Project Company said that this was “not a unique event ” and that it had recently been “a lot of reports of this aggressive behavior. ”
The Facebook record says that its volunteers collected 12 bags of garbage in the collection at Hope's Nose on Sunday and that “many examples of antisocial behavior ” had been seen.

Expecting Great Floods for Hannah
Hanna, the first hurricane of the Atlantic Ocean in this year, reached a country in Texas, U.S.A., last night.
Hannah quickly lost power and became a storm, but despite that, there has been a great rainfall in the region and is expected to be a vast flood.
It is expected to rain up to 30 inches [30 cm] in one day, but in specific places it could reach up to 46 inches [46 cm], according to the AP News Service.
Especially is it warned of dangerous sudden floods that might occur because of the rain.
The area where Hanna reached the land has been struck by the great distribution of the new crown virus there.
In addition, seas have been landscaped and damaged.
Now there are at least 43,700 people without electricity, and there have been an open - up mass relief station in the area.
The U.S. president Donald Trump was thrilling the storm last night, saying that people listen to experts and adhere to instructions.
This morning, the photographer of the AP news company captured videos below.
Houses burned, shops robbed and interior damaged
More than sixty are dead and sixty more are wounded after attack in the village of Masteri in the Darfur region of Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the latest in the series of serious security incidents in the last few weeks in which houses were burned, shops and marketed were robbed, and damaged, ” says the United Nations Human Defence Office in the capital of Kartum, which was sent out today.
Abdalla Hamdok, Prime Minister of Sudan, has announced that security forces will be sent to the war - stricken province to “protect the inhabitants and the harvest. ”
Only two days ago, an unknown army in the area killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in another attack.
“The rise in violence in different parts of the Darfur region is leading to an increase in roots, jeopardises agriculture and threatens people’s lives and livelihood, ” says the United Nations.
The conflict in Darfur, in the western part of Sudan, began in 2003 when rebels, most of the Arabs, resurrected against the governor of Kartum.
The military forces of governments and Arab troops who tried to destroy the rebellion have been accused of widespread cruelty, but some 3000,000 were killed in the fights, according to the United Nations estimate.
Omas al-Bashir, cast from a chair as the leader of Sudan, is called for by the International Criminal Court for a suspected war crime, genocide, and crime against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, new governments in Sudan are now trying to negotiate peace with major rebel groups.
A TV Newswoman Thanks a Spectator for Noting Cancer Hud
TAMPA, Florida (AP) — A TV newswoman in Florida thanks an observer for having noticed a knot on her neck and emailed her that she should be checked.
Victoria Price, a reporter from WFLA, Tampa, followed this advice and had cancer.
Price said on Twitter that she was going to surgery on Monday to allow the tumour, thyroid and several lymph nodes to be removed.
“The doctor said it was spreading, but not too much, and we hope that this will be my first and last operation, ” she said.
The audience sent Price email last month and said that the node reminded her of a node that she had had.
Price, a 28 - year - old researcher, said this week that her TV station’s slogans were “8 on your side. ”
“ But the roles changed recently when a viewer was on the team with ME, and I couldn’t be more grateful, ” said Price.
“ I will be forever grateful to the woman who made an effort to send me an e - mail, a completely strange woman.
She had no obligation to do that, but she did.
Speaking of being with a man in a joint."
Part of the outdoor area Jeronimo Open Space closed temporarily after two plaque wolves attacks – CBS Los Angeles
Two were bitten by coyotes near the Oso Creek route on the Jeronimo Road of Mission Viejo on Saturday morning and had to close the route temporarily.
Laura Wittmer says she sees coyotes almost every morning, and usually she tries to avoid them just, but on Saturday morning one came straight to her and bit her in the foot.
The walkway has been closed while the attacks are investigated.
Mission Viejo City published a thrill, which said: “Today two different members announced that a coyote bite a person; the animal welfare service Mission Viejo is working on the matter in cooperation with the branch of fish and animal life, and part of Jeronimo Open Space has been closed; be careful and watchful when traveling with wild animals. ”
Wittmer tried to beat off the coyote with a bottle of water.
She called the emergency line to get a ride to her car, but she was able to drive to an emergency clinic.
The pry wolf disappeared in the hills, but officials hope to fire it and test it for rabies.
Wittmer will be treated for rabies as a precaution for the next two weeks.
She said this terrifying incident wouldn't keep her from the morning runs, but from now on, she would choose another place.
The situation of the other person who was bit is not clear.
Protestant racial hatred matches the Seattle police
A conflict in Seattle on Sunday between police and Protestant against racial hatred ended with arresting a number of people, but displeasing public demands because of the United States president Donald Trump’s plan to send a number of federal policemen into major cities.
Protesting racial hatred and police violence has arisen after the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis in May.
In Seattle, protestors cut wheelchairs and broke windows in wheelchairs on Saturday’s protests, causing the police to declare a state of upheaval and empty the streets with pepper sprays and flash bombs.
Protestants also set fire to wheelchairs in a building area for an anticipated teenage prison.
The police claimed to have arrested 45 people, but 21 police officers had been injured.
The protest was held in support of the protests that prevailed in the neighbouring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the field light after Trump ordered very controversial radical action by federal police officers, in unpleasant local authorities, who say the police use excessive power.
Protesting marches have been held in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of the state of Texas, one was shot to death in armed conflicts in the city on Saturday night, according to the police.
Concomitant with the Protests, Trump is increasingly difficult to fight for re-election in November, and has adopted a harsh law enforcement policy.
