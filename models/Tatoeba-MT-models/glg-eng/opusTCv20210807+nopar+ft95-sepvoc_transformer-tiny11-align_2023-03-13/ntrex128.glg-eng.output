Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned with "to take them for monkeys"
Consternation among some of the members of the Assembly, currently called AM, for the suggestion that they should change the name by MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate arose by plans to change the name of the assembly by the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole landscape fear being the object of ridicule.
A Labour Party member said his group was concerned that the new name "mall with Twp and Pwp".
For those who do not know Welsh, "twp" means "parvo" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the group's set "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group maintained a "very open" on the name change, but noted that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to Yorkshire's English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently writing legislation to introduce name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act granted the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation carried out on these proposals that showed much support for the name of Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the matter of the title of AM, the commission preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but MWP's option received a majority of support in a public consultation.
It seems that AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to achieve consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, which is expected to deliver the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules of disqualification of the AM and the design of the committee system.
The AM will get the final vote on how they should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians join the polls in referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to resolve a dispute that has already lasted for decades with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim from its territory and repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership requests.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he will listen to the vote.
However, the advocates of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no more at the price you have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells remain silent while Harlem churches continue to fight
“The elders I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“Today, not one thing or the other.”
He said he could understand that the bars disappeared.
“Now people are socializing in other ways,” he said.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money of the sale of assets does not last as long as the leaders wait, and "before or later they will return where they began".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners full of the type of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain shrines.
“The vast majority of the people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore, will accelerate the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners become members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation changed in the 1930s.
A black congregation was built with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125 Street stores, a Harlem shopping street that was aimed at hiring and ascending black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as father Johnson's parishes made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptized the carillon as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called him otherwise: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it to the largest carillon of Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took its place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin for the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some taken by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish board, the body that governs the parish and which is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing him his concern why the latter "pretened to regain the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the hiring of the architects and the contractors who sent the diocese.
Some of the parishes complained of the lack of transparency by the diocese.
A shark hurts a boy while fishing lobsters in California
Police reported that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while practicing underwater fishing in search of lobsters in California on the first day of the season of that crustacean.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel narrated KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been about half an hour diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help screaming, at which time he was born with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only emotion for fishing a lobster, but that he soon realized he was screaming, "I was treated!
They brought me!'
He had the crushed collar." Hammel said he realized when he came to the boy.
“I threw everyone out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!” said Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady children's hospital in San Diego, where he is admitted to a critical state.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that they had seen a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but who had determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
The officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake research and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debesthams with beauty corridors similar to those of large warehouses full of expert assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the UK beauty market, which amounts to 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow while sales fall in fashion and household products, the largest runners with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and then they will pass to others next year if they succeed.
Beauty investment occurs at a time when supermarkets seek to fill the shelves that in their day occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty products until reaching 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those that can be seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are suitable for vegans, something increasingly demanded by the younger clientele.
In addition, the perfume store, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon in southern London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores implies that supermarkets have to do more to convince people who visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said the establishments will increasingly look like shopping malls, as supermarket chains try to compete with discounts stores such as Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Inhabitat sales points in hundreds of stores, as he bought the two chains two years ago. This has strengthened edible sales and surrendered the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but association came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute pharmacy revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business formed by 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for ?25 million three years ago.
Lloyds was noted that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transform the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff that can be attended to ask for advice.
Our product range is designed to adjust to all attractive and practical needs and locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges the old shopping habits.
Peter Jones "fuious" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from $11 million business
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "fuious" after television presenter Holly Willoughby had retired from a ?11 million business with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for his brand of home clothing and Truly accessories.
His company had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwynedd Paltrow.
The 37-year-old John's presenter used Instagram to announce his farewell.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones throwing sparks away from his lifestyle mark in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "furious" when the television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that he no longer had time to devote him to the brand of home clothes and accessories of both Truly.
The business came compared to Goop, Gwynedd's brand, and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, he resorted to Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed to one of his holiday residences.
One source said, "Truly was different from Holly's priorities.
It will be your long-term future over the next two decades.
His decision to leave left atonites to all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of goods in the Marlowe offices ready to sell.”
Experts believe that the abandonment of This Morning’s presenter is among Britain’s most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, due to considerable investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and textiles for the home, and that could further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are three-child parents and have a close amized with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples were on vacation and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a host in the ITV I'm a Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night that “We shouldn’t comment on his business affairs.”
A difficult conversation “and then we fell in love.”
He played with the criticism he would receive by the media for making a comment that some would consider "little of a president" and being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he put his voice as a “journal presenter.”
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in maintaining a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a big step towards North Korea denuclearization.
But the negotiations for denuclearization spread.
More than three despite after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that the North does not see the "correspondent response" by the United States to the first measures to disarm North Korea.
In contrast, he said, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump has adopted a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
“Things with North Korea are fine,” he said.
“We’re going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship.”
He claimed that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending missile tests, help free the hostages and bring home to the remaining American soldiers.
He defended his unusual strategy by talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheater, we would have about 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd he had right ahead.
A earthquake and tsunami devastated an island in Indonesian leaving hundreds of deaths
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organization were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition to catalyze international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they will not apply for international help, so it is a challenge,” Mrs. Summbung said.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for disaster management, said Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to their help.
Given the earthquakes that constantly endures Indonesia, the country is extremely poorly prepared to face the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not common to find them on other coasts.
Although an alert was issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, traveling between many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been highlighted in Lombok to cater to the victims of the earthquake is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around improving Indonesian infrastructure, and provided money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a large lack of funds on the final straight to the re-election of next year.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continued sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a way to live the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were murdered and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the confrontation in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, which use machetes, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the goal of the draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before throwing a shot to the second stick.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced to the upper left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling on a Kepa Arrizabalaga that jumped into the air and entering the net.
“I just tried to get to that position, organizing us, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as long as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I came to Kante and say a touch without thinking too much and just shot.”
Chelsea won 1-0 in the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard had scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue front passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning near the middle change and running into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a wall in the center of the field.
He made a beautiful deep pass driving to Hazard to the area.
Hazard outpaced the defense and ended up in the second stick marking with a shot with the buzz that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool faces Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stade San Paolo de Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of fatalities of the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The figure of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, according to Sunday morning the national disaster management agency.
Many people would be trapped among the debris of the buildings that came down with the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters, as indicated in a press conference the spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from the destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman died crooked
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with white gun wounds on John Street, and stopped a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
Police asked the people in the area to see or hear something from that step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan stated: "The investigation is in his early stage, but I would like to make a call to contact us anyone who had been near John Street at Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera of the command frame to contact us, as they could have key information for our research.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belongs to a neighbor of Birkenhead and found himself within a property.
This afternoon, friends who raised to meet the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where he met that morning.
The investigation continues while police are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police informed him that they do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The man was speechless when he discovered what happened.
Residents have just known that they will not be able to enter again within a few hours.
He listened to a police officer telling a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
A woman crying appears on stage.
Not to say “It’s horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cord with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cord watching the apartment block.
To anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to ?MerPolCC, who calls 101 or who contact Crimetoppers in the phone number 0800 555 111 citing the September 30 registration.
Cromwell's statue of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle for "rewriting history"
Its ban would be poetic justice for its Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by its fanatical and Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion to "disparate" and "try rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the withdrawal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure located outside the Westminster Palace became an objective.
The iconoclasty of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe they would have sacrificed Cromwell wrong by the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent representation by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a test of the opinion existing in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to remain paying tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith declared The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not it is a complete representation, it is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the mid-17th century conflict defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also deserving of celebration and commemoration.”
A killer pig crushes a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a southwestern China market.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that man, identified only by the nickname, "Yuan," was found dead with a sealed artery and blood-covered near a court in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines to pigs in a bowl on 30 and May 2005 in Xining, in Qinghai Province, China.
He had apparently traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave another adjacent court.
He said there was a large male with blood in his mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, nearly 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he killed him.
"My cousin had his legs bloody and crushed," said the cousin, nicknamed "Wu", to Guiyang Evening News.
The recording of the safety chamber shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed their pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market director told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent anyone else from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence on stage.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although they are not very common, cases of pigs that attack humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kilos shortened a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and spread to the animal.
After a Oregon farmer had been devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that blood taste can act as a "disparator.
“They’re just playing.
They are like kids, very curious... they don’t intend to hurt.
You just have to have the necessary respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy and generalized rains to the southwest of the United States.
The forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it exceeds the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will take torrential rains to northern Mexico and southwest of the United States for the next few days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, the east time, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds over 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to advance north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a fence begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward, towards the U.S. East Coast. As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity north, which will penetrate the southwestern US.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the fence will create abundant and generalized rains in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and the possibility of land detachments in the desert.
Large tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain are expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with conditions in deterioration due to the scattered character of tropical rain.
We strongly un venture into the desert under tropical rain threat.
Heavy rains could form cannons that could become floating rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally scratched winds and dust.
The fence will bring locally strong rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total rainfall could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause flow of smaller debris and rough roads.
These would be the first rains of the wet season in the region.
Dispersed tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona in the last hours of Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain extends at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature oscillations in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this involves significant temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in central the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm October start is expected, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which make up about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates large probabilities of temperatures above average to the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate testimonies of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt its usual programming for a last-minute news on Friday: an agreement designed by Senator by Arizona, Jeff Flake, for the FBI to conduct a week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that he is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh made him touch them while drunk and tried to take his clothes out at a party at the institute.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that this had not happened.
Nielsen reported Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company featured the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other channels that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen often has trouble measuring people who watch television from offices.
To get an idea, it is an audience similar to that of a football ending or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.66 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2,94, MSNBC 2,89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure on Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican office made a statement indicating that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being pushed by protesters when he tried to enter an elevator on his way to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stayed with his eyes low for several minutes while rebuked, televised live on CNN.
“I’m here in front of you,” a woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?
He said, “You have power while there are many defenseless women.”
Flake said his office made a Flake statement, before the elevator was closed, added that he would have more to say in the committee's audience.
All television and cable channels broadcast hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment to the entire Senate to submit to the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee next week, which established a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations held with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of “playing politics” with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticize her plans to abandon the European Union to “play politics” with Britain’s future and harming national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with his on the cover of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on attacking May's so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should raise tariffs on the other part was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims killed: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspected of the death of LSU's player
Police arrested a suspect in shootings that ended the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the LSU.
According to Baton Rouge's police department, Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder.
The officers broadcast the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims had lost their glasses during the fight.
Police regained stage glasses and claimed to contain Simpson's DNA, according to CBS's affiliated channel WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, police said he admitted to be the author of the shot that killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he was imposed on a bond of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Forensic Office issued a preliminary report on Friday that indicates that the cause of death is a bullet wound on the head that reached the neck.
The department praised Louisiana State Police's unit of fugitives, the state police' criminalism company, Southern University police, is the neighbors for their help to get the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Aleva thanked local order forces for his "disligence and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 shipyard grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average of the last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was "abanted" and "conmoted" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what worries us all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ash on Mexico City
The ashes that throws the Popocatepetl volcano arrived in the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was overseeing several bursts and tremors.
The images of social networks showed thin layers of ash on the windshiel of the neighborhoods of Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists detected an increase in volcano activity 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 has shaken central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The Catalan police and separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters faced riot police and while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of proseparatists masked by riot police led them eggs and dust paint that created dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
There were also refreshments that same day with the police, who used the pores to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independent groups who coerated "Nicence or forgiveness", faced Unionist protesters who shouted "Larga life in Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated by minor injuries received in the protest, according to the local press.
The tension continues the skin flower in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters chose to be overwhelmingly by independence, although participation was low and the opposite of secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to stop the vote at the electoral tables throughout the region in violent confrontations.
Pro-independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also occurred but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who went to the independence demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had hope in the possibility that Catalonia gained independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite gaining a tight victory, though decisive in the regional elections last December, this year the pro-independent Catalan parties fought to maintain the momentum, with many of their best-known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained in thewaiting trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with her mobile, said the conflict had been fed by politicians on both sides.
“There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pretrial detention since last year, announced that the following year would be held in elections to the European Parliament.
“Presenting myself as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government,” he said.

The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 (summer time in Britain).
Police investigation inspector Bob Blemmings declared the snare and the building itself were the damaged parts.
You may also have shot a baby against the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston the 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The promoted Livingston surprised Rangers by taking Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to climb a level by placing after the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team is still running out of the house this year in the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, Hearts, of which they separate them eight points.
But before the Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston is still in the division for the sixth consecutive match; lead coach Holt yet knows the defeat since he had replaced Kenny Miler the past me.
Livingston escapes opportunities against weakened visitors
Holt's team must have advanced long before the time they scored, as with their control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way but his cross-shot did not cross the doorry threshold; then, Alan Lithgow's shot went out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the goal.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger visitors in the stops ball games.
And that’s how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers granted a free shot and Livingston made a draw on which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix Menga, who touched the ball and marked from the center of the area.
At that time the Rangers dominated possession but had met with an impenetrable defense that avoided much work from guarding Liam Kelly.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced an Kelly stop.
The Rangers guard, Allan McGregor, stopped a shot by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball out in another game Livingston's standing ball.
Many cross-walks were proposed in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two penalty requests were rejected: one per hand and another for a Halkett entrance to Glenn Middleton replacement.
"Fenomenal" by Livingston: Analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macarani Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They have been excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their upward trajectory.
His game style and players have only changed since he returned to the top category, but part of Holt's merit for the way he promoted the team since his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, proudly directed a perfectly organized defense while Menga did not give them a breath throughout the game to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerrard's order, this time they did not reach that level.
They failed the last pass. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. A whole call for the Rangers, which is found in half the table.
Erdogan receives ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were blue smiles and skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to fix the relationship between NATO allies.
They have discussed many issues, including human rights, press freedom and access from Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a giant new mosque.
The city brings together the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan's supporters came to see his president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive it in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflect the division to an acclaimed visitor as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Deftford traffic accident: a cyclist dies when colliding with a car
A cyclist died in a collision where a car was wrapped in London.
The accident took place near the crossing between the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street streets, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, around 10:15 hours (summer time in Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died at the spot.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist died in a runout on Childers Street just over a kilometer and a half of the Saturday accident.
Metropolitan police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street locks and buses were diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers are injured in the riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercate in high-security prison, according to prison officer.
The riot began in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 p.m. (summer time in Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to take care of the riots, in which eight prisoners are involved in a pavilion.
The officers received attention from minor injuries on their face.
A prison service spokesman said: “The prison staff was specially trained to face a continued incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that the responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between the grids.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was known that the director of the prison centre had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials had to go to prison to calm a revolt in which the staff was assaulted with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (the places affected by drought could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it is very likely to occur earlier next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday, western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly on Phoenix on Tuesday and will arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service indicated in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 320-kilometre radio from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread on a 64-kilometre radius of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Meteorological Service predict 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150l/m2 in the Arizona Mogollón Bordo.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Great Basin could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with possible total isolated totals of 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, Rosa's rain could be a blessing, as the region is heavily affected by droughts.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second largest category,” saidweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will touch land on the Lower California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have a hurricane force on Sunday morning, with winding a maximum of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heads north to 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is encountering cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason, it is expected to touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force on the afternoon or on Monday night.
It could rain very intensely in some areas of Mexico, assuming a significant risk of flooding.
“The total rainfall of between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, and it is possible to meet up to 250 l/m2,” saysweather.com.
Rosa then headed north by crossing Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border at the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and will continue to rise across Arizona and enter southern Utah at the last hour of the night of Tuesday.
“The main danger of Rosa or what remains of it are heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the Southwestern Desert of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause sudden water trumpets and debris flows in deserts, and land detachments on mountainous terrains.
Congress in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for assassination attempt
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder to find a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 04:00 (summer time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remained “stable.”
According to Somerset police, they were arrested in the Radstock area three boys from 17, 18 and 20 years respectively.
The officers asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the phone of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“To see Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffed the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he denied categorically and emotionally the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago, being teenagers.
Ford also testified in the trial of his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that day the "Americans" were witnesses of the brilliance, quality and courage" by Kavanaugh.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with an imposing public service history,” he said to the multitude of Western Virginia admirers.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while talking about the importance of Republican results in the half-time elections.
“It’s five weeks for one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don’t know, but I really do it,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going to fight everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats’ mission is to “oppose and hinder.”
The first Senate-processing vote on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place before Friday, CNN said an assistant to the Republican Party.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami causes hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke on the beaches, when a major earthquake and a tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves up to six meters broke on land to the luscofusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in their passage.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“Before the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were deceased,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a round of prey in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, he dragged cars, trunks, home, dragged everything he found,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had walked high sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs spread by the national disaster management agency showed many destroyed shops and buildings, twisted bridges and toppled and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnifie the size of the tsunami, said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantious" and said that thousands of homes, shopping and hotel hospitals had come down.
The bodies of some victims were caught under the debris of the destroyed buildings, declared, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and damage could be larger along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala and that it is closer to the epicenter of earthquake.
The communications were "totally paralyzed and there is no information" by Donggala, added Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency was harshly criticized on Saturday for not having informed of the arrival of a tsunami to Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of shared fans on social media, you can listen to a man who finds himself on the last floor of a building screaming frantically warning of the arrival of a tsunami to people who were on the street.
Within minutes, the water collides against the edge carrying buildings and cars ahead.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major shutdown that caused the cut of communications throughout Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Authorities claim that the army has already begun sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has opened again but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centers of Palu on Sunday.
The balance of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds the figure of 800.
It's terrible.
During the way he traveled World Vision staff to get to the city of Palu, where employees stand in lona shelters raised in the courtyard of his office, contemplated scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba commented.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of starting assistance in the event of catastrophe, some complained that they were preventing Palu from traveling to foreign humanitarian assistance workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and personnel from abroad can only flow if the place of calamity is declared a national catastrophic zone.
And that hasn’t happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the level of a province,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, “This is a national disaster,” we can open ourselves to international help, but that moment has not yet come.”
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami, family and friends of the missing men were eager to hope that their loved ones were one of the miracles that light the depressing argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they took a child out of a sink.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been under the debris with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national team, had trained two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, who concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Hotel were his students.
“As a person with extensive experience in the field of paraglider, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the Reda Hotel collapse among the parapentantist community, he had desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, only one gray mark was shown instead of two blue marks.
“I think that means that messages were not delivered,” he added.
They steal $26,750 while reloading a cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who recharged a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
In the press release, researcher officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the car driver had emptyed a cashier in the leisure complex and prepared to deliver more money.
While busy, another man "was running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the stage, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identities, contact Newport police calling the number 859-292-3680.
The rapper Kanye West changes the name of Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41 years ago, is known as Ye, who used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change occurred before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where his new album Yandhi is expected to launch.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled his assistance for "emotional reasons", according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means “you”,” he said that same year West while talking about his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
“So I am you, it’s us.
I have passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye, who is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is another of the famous rappers who changed the name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he prefers to call him Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, was also passionate about putting and removing the script and using capital letters.
AMLO undertakes not to use military personnel against civilians
Mexico’s elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, pledged not to use military force against civilians again when the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students is approaching.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "I would not use the military again to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing some 300 people at a time when the student movements were rooted throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly aid to children who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag children to criminal bands.
The US should double investment in I.A.
According to the AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, employed by Google, Microsoft and Apple, the US should double the amount you invest in AI in view of China’s growing activity in the field.
The comments occurred after several parts of the U.S. government had made ads about AI, even if the United States lack a formal strategy on AI.
China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be number 1 in innovation in AI by 2030.
“Duplicating the research budget in AI would be a good start, since other countries are far back than the US, and we are looking for the next big advance in AI,” Lee said.
Duplicate funding could double the chances that the next AI achievement was made in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Director General of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent Chinese AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won American Othello's player with the highest score and was later executive at Microsoft Research of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology contests such as the robotic Challenge of the Advanced Defense Research Projects Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to get government scholarships, Lee said.
“China is not the one who is taking academic leaders, but companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university geniuses to work in AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the United States to boost her efforts in AI.
“I think they should offer residence cards to doctors in AI,” he said.
The Council of State of China published its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Sciences Foundation offers funding to people from academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Early this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an artificial intelligence center that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the select Committee of Artificial Information.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research in AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that sought to create a national security Commission on artificial intelligence does not record movement for months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum if they change the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute for decades with Greece and had blocked admission applications in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim from its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign sparked doubts about whether the result will reach the minimum 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum question was: “Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Defenders of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying to gain admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the Yugoslavia fall.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of the parliament said they would notice the outcome of the vote and that they would make it definitive.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority of the parliament.
The State Committee of Elections said that no irregularities had been recorded at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections of 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters deposited their vote.
“I have voted for my children, our site is in Europe,” Gjose Tanevski said, a 62-year-old voter of the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited his vote for the Macedonian referendum on the change of the country's name that would open the way for his accession to the European Union in Strumics, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted for those who had boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our heads high and not by the service door, Kavatorkov added.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev states that NATO membership will bring the investment so necessary to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of entry into the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said a positive result would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the required.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television network Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he would vote.
To make the referendum valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it had acceded to power in May of the past.
See: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, crosses all of Brighton's defense and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling accounted for the defense of Brighton with 2-0 Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy to score the 65th minute goal.
The Argentine frontman received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before heading to the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He disbanded from a defense before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English front used the first touch area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit the Brighton Mathew Ryan guard.
"Aguero is going through some problems on the foot," said City coach Pep Guardiola, to reporters.
“We’re talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that’s when it happened.
We were lucky to have marked at that time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Blue Eastes the initial lead in the Premier League confrontation.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball in the depth of the Brighton field in that game.
He sent a beautiful walk to the hole on the right side to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite pole.
The bluelights put the ball in the goal before leaving the field.
The City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies party
With the Nationals outside the fight for the elimination, there were not many reasons to force another ownership.
But an ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to launch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the Rockies, which take an advantage game to Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the national league.
The Rockies settled at least one position of thecard with the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they continue to try to close their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, at least we can touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level I played this year.
Why don’t I want to compete in that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who the opening will be on Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to be the one who is in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his number 34 start, made another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably throw Sunday on their usual rest day.
The Washington ban is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strips at 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump celebrates a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the elected one for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the result in the half-time elections.
“We played everything we did in November.
It takes five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't compose, but I really do it and that's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued to say, “You see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look at what is happening now.
And they are determined to regain power using any necessary means, evil, and meanness.
They don’t care who hurt, above those who have to happen to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control and we will never give it.”
The mission of Democrats is to oppose and hinder.”
"And they've seen that after four days," he said, qualifying the Democrats of "noy, brave, disgusting, disgusting and liars."
He listed the Senate's judicial committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by the name, which received strong apopos from the public.
“Do you remember your answer?
Filtering the document?
Mmm...jem, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language, the worst I've seen."
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
It is not tolerant of those who express your opinion.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, the truth is that I was not surprised too much.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who are not well received, and everything to say our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way because he successfully faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, on national security and Europe, casually issues on which Jeremy dissected with previous leaders.
The notification for the Labour Meeting of Nottingham East on Friday indicated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I have been a Labour deputy, the meetings on Friday night of the committee were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "most kind and gentle" policy has been forgotten a long time ago, if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and judge whether all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, when colleagues he believed to share a similar political vision began to expect me to portray and adopt positions with which he would never agree, whether in the field of national security as the EU's unique market.
When I speak publicly, and in reality it doesn’t matter what I say, there’s a tremendous dawn and attacks on social media censoring the center policy, I’m telling myself that it shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments that are directed to me are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not argue.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every “non-trust” movement or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower of sights.
Over the past few years I have received many advice that urge me to keep my head crouched, not so frank and then "everything would go well for me."
I didn’t get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party there have been 32 while still in school, led by the negligence of Thatcher’s government that literally had dropped my class, I tried to claim better public services for those who need them the most, both being local councillor and government minister.
I never hid my policy, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused with my political positions and in which I disagree with the current leadership of the party.
Those who promoted the Friday motion, the only thing I would tell you is that while the country walks to a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don’t understand that desire to waste time and energy by questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my electors, whether they are members of the party: I am proud to serve them and promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unfeeled Ayr
The last two attempts may have changed the final result a little, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved to win this beloved game in Tenent's Premier League.
They are now leading the table and is the only free team of the ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking, took the team to victory. And coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
“So far they have been tested in our party and we are still uninvited, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “You have to admit that the Ayr took advantage of the opportunities better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute rehearsal, transformed by Frazier Climo, put the Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, ceded to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot beat a wrong throw.
Climo increased the advantage for the Ayr with a penalty, before, just in half a while, he turned a solo shot, leaving the score 17-5 in favor of the Ayr in the rest.
But Melrose began well the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop for the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, who left the field in the padola and, from the restart, Ayr advanced more through an essay by Staffford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
The acting captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having another player with a Bruce Colvine rehearsal who did not consume, at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for plaqueing Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson scored an essay from the penalty line on the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he did almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe had collected the launch in the David Armstrong area and sent him to the third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth rehearsal of the local team.
Still Game's protagonist begins a new career in the restoration industry
Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems to be prepared to enter the restoration industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and co-starizes with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final, and it seems that Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a source of Scottish Sun hinted that Kiern wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
“The sea is ours”: Inner Bolivia expects the court to the way to the Pacific
The sailors watch a naval seat covered with devices in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are denied from the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
In Bolivia without sea, the memory of a lost coast before Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict continues to live, as long as the desire to renovate the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes are at its most exalted point in decades, as Bolivia expects a decision from the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX sentence on giant screens throughout the country in the hope that the Court of Hague is pronounced in favor of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of Bolivia from a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot in play in the Monday sentence.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts consider the court unlikely to give Bolivia reason, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations-based body in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory, and stipulated that it will not determine the result of possible conversations.
The fact that the CIX sentence comes only six months after the final arguments we hear indicates that the case "not complicated", says Chilean expert in international law Peace Zárate.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could have been delayed.
“The theme of access to the sea takes a long time blocked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales's belligerent rhetoric undermined the goodwill left to Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had been making an unusually fast decision.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile", and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this subject for political purposes.
“Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the US.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong declares that his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among his leaders.
This comment occurs at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy stagnant for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that it is "a utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections from the United States to a statement that ends the Korean War can double the North.
In Washington, they resist accepting the declaration without Pyongyang to take the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion parades reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the tents.
If you want to increase your hat collection or cover yourself completely from the sun, look no more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-green 2019 collection that embraced the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers pulled out their most surprising creations to the gateway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a wide wing imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large accessories were sweetened watermelons, a magician hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head of the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high sewing.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving team, with glasses and tube, and others a melted ice cream cone.
If you are a fan of the huge fashion, you are lucky.
Fashion understood predicted that giant hats could reach the tents.
Disproported hats come just after the "Bomba", the straw hat with a 60-centmeter-high-up that takes everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has taken another great creation to the walkway: a straw beach bag almost as large as the model stuck with a swimsuit that carries it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather wing, was the prominent piece of Jacquemus' La Riviera's spring collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage declared FEMAIL: "I hope big hats and beach bags arrive at the stores next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories'.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
Scotland’s private schools maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored study plan, we are seeing that modern languages remain a popular and desired theme within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language you understand, that’s coming to his head.
But if you speak to him in his own tongue, he will come to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Of the results of this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and with the highest approved rates in private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages have gained an outstanding.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that make up SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained honorary enrollment in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently taking the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs and of all kinds.
A survey conducted by the Commission for employment and training in the UK in 2014, indicated that among the lack of language knowledge is 17% of the reasons why employers cost to cover vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more working possibilities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language they will have a real advantage in the future with a life skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, in this case 15%.
It is so important to invest in a language for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children more opportunities to find significant employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classic modern languages, while others choose languages considered more important to the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what the interests of their children are, private schools always have several languages to choose and expert teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future should be given to them.
We cannot deny that at this time, in a global business environment, that languages remain of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered “international communication skills”.
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
The good faut is doing it.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait was almost over for the fans who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Team coach Like Walton announced that James will play the initial game of the preseason against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still have to decide how many minutes you will play.
“It will be more than 1 and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the early week training, they asked James for their plans the pre-season of six Lakers games.
At this point in my career I don’t need pre-season games to be ready,” he said.
Trump’s election events arrive in Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be Trump’s first of 5 minutes scheduled for next week, including stops in cities related to him like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the paused confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to gain support for the next half-time elections, since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the internet?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump’s rally in West Virginia to continue via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with the issue of trial held this week to the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense on charges of inappropriate sexual conduct and keeps the Senate’s confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans face the November elections with a new boost.
Therefore, these five rallies Trump will give next week are aimed at “dinating volunteers and sympathizers while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“The control of Congress is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible towards the campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters that he preferred not to be nominated.
The rally this night, which will be held at Wesbank Stadium, could bring together supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and obtain coverage of Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month Trump visiting West Virginia, the state in which he won for more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Western Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in surveys.
“It’s not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support it in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, a polytologist at the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until the individual games on Sunday
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon fire could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The driver's oscillating pendulum is a fully invented sports concept but in which athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so I guess we took it as a little boost,” Jordan Spieth said while leaving at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more in play.
The Americans, said Spieth, feel they have a little wind in favor and a lot to cheer up, among other things the technique of Spieeth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each has three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from the tea to the Greek and is preaching with the example.
These guttural screams became stronger as his round progressed, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
When he got the putt that made them win the game in 15, he threw a similar scream, the kind of scream he says he thinks the American team is not yet out.
“You just have to focus and worry about your game,” Spieth said.
It’s the only thing that’s left to these players now.
18 holes to leave a footprint.
The only players with the most points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four of four and cannot be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way it seems to flow their energy to the crowd and from it, confirms them how rivals beat Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to win when the sun is put on Le Golf National that Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly discarded Sergio García, the hero of the morning fireballs, when he appeared with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first route ended Spanish and Swedish in a hole of what they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursoms are so fascinating to see closely by interactions between couples, the advice they give, which are not the way you can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the last day, but this funeral session also showed that Team USA has endurance to fight, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has a 10-6 advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the footballs and footballs with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two wins over a Tiger Woods with difficulty climbing four points to the scoreboard at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which seeks to retain the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning footballs, putting the 3-1 series.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursoms, winning four games, but could not cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Milliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points of the four initial games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fireballs, they fit perfectly to defeat a unclosed Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 more categorical.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without sorrow or glory, showed occasional rabies of brilliance, but now lost 19 of 29 games in the modalities of footballs and shorts and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning fireballs, reunited with his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursoms taking a defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in southwestern Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference point for the Americans scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 win over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fireballs and again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursoms after losing the first two holes.
There were only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup in which a team scored four points in the individual, although as the current trophy holder, Furyk's team only needs to tie it to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of its reach.
North Cora says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister reported Saturday to the United Nations that continued sanctions increased their distrust in the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted "important measures to show its goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing fields and commit to the proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see the corresponding response from the United States,” he added.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral first to us.”
While Ri resumed the already well-known North Korean complaints about Washington resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it adopted measures, his statement seemed important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it had occurred with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to "denuclearization" of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump secured North Korea's security.
North Korea has been looking for a formal end for the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that first Pyongyang must postpone its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted relaxing the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on “denuclearization first” and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal of coercive intercourse, and even oppose the “declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us kneeling is an impossible dream, for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions sharpen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader mentioned in the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this topic of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead point."
Still, Ri's tone was radically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the "evil president" Trump called Kim "home rocket on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "detruve totally" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage by taking action to disarmament, but said there is still a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said there was no time for that, and that “it takes two years, three or five months.”
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that: “The fulfillment of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompey met with Ri on the margin of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would return to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had advanced, just a few hours for North Korea to denounce him for making "male demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "corresponding measures".
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he requested were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the advance towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all its students sleep more in order to combat the growth of sexist culture from studying all night stimulated by caffeine.
An academic has found that university students number one in the world often don’t know the basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, conceived the course, which believes he is the first of this kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up and said, ‘Why just tell me this now, in my last year?”
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits helps academic and athletic performance, as well as improves general well-being.
Paul Barrier, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The course of an hour duration involves a number of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee bowls, curtains, trainers and books to obtain information about the effects of caffeine and light and how the sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine when bedtime.
In another section, participants are informed of how prolonged sleep failure can increase the risk of heart attacks, brain spills, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what health effects are if we opt for smoking tobacco,” said Professor Czeisler.
The pride culture of spending the entire night awakens still exists, he states. And it adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students who involved lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you sleep enough and has a good quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, it points out. Even avoid getting fat, as lack of sleep causes the brain to enter into an starvation mode, which makes him hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course across the campus.
The next step, waits, is to ask all post-grade students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider the option to set an alarm to lie down, as well as when they wake up. Likewise, it is advisable to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalanced the circadian rhythm and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disartulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team intended to record their first home win since the 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach, which left his team eight points from the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and an alignment of the Rangers with little inspiration never gave the feeling that he was tied.
While the Rangers descended to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a goal of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the line judge Calum Spence had to have dealt with a head wound after the alleged launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that dragged the Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
Holt was with the same 11 of the Livingston who took a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organized set suffocated his opponents at all times.
The Rangers may dominate possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have marked in just two minutes when Menga's first time pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot by Keaghan Jacobs arrived at Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him in the second stick.
The Rangers took control, but they seem to have more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Alfredo Morelos felt that they would have been penalized at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only shot at the door in the first half, but the old Ibrox guard, Liam Kelly, had only problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head finish and the attack of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for his hard work.
The Rangers failed again when he faced the strong formation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fell in love with the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blood to choose Menga for a single finish.
Gerrard acted on the break by changing Couulibaly by Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the Zurdo made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halket collecting a long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead in the final moments, but McGregor rose perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow was changed from the crown.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty when entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson looked back.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our almanac of the "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and I counted... was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Home: “What is that in the world?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When these headphones are placed, the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of minerals can be heard.
Evans: "I say, I'm sure you're going to explode now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
The invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer and re-injection it.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "impulates the growth of various types of cancer", including those of breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients and "sinsign them" to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on Trump's speech by using a hat by MAG (Make America Great Again) after his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
The result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West took on the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised US President Donald Trump, and said he would be nominated in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat of Make America Great Again, criticized the Democrats and reiterated their support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white man and say, “How can you like Trump if he’s racist?”
If I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the program with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the United States Senate Judicial Committee on the demands of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded West's critical images to social media.
It’s not clear whether Rock was trying to mock West with this post.
West also complained to the audience that he had spent a bad time on the scenes due to his hat.
“They went out with me on the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out with that hat.”
I was intimidated!
And then they said I was going to pick up," said the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pick up?", saying I would "use my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do." You want the world to advance?
Try it with love.”
His comments led to the audience at least twice and SNL cast members seemed to be ashamed, he informed Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave to the publication: "All the study was left in absolute silence."
They had named West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former young man, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people perplexed with a performance of the song I love it, dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West gained support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: thank you for making a break to MAFIA"
However, the presenter of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply "being who it is and that's completely wonderful."
“So and everything, I chose not to reward anyone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his “art”) that I think he is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "or officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges for attempted homicide for stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to be present before the Belfast Judges Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor’s Service will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of sexist hero, saying that these roles on the screen translate into what it seems that young people often have to be tough for them to respect them.
When talking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the ?MeToo era (I also).
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he feels "strong seat" to address the problem.
"Persorically, I feel pretty strong right now. What are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its very male characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel they have to be that certain part of being a man?
I think it’s really one of the biggest questions of our time; how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he won't make any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that "beard of horses and battlefields".
From November, Kit will star in a replacement for True West (The True West), by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his encounter with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this program, so, in a way, he gave me my future family and my life from here on,” he said.
Rose played Ygrinte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, the health authorities have declared.
40,000 new cases were notified only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in interannual terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual HIV transmission is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against China in 1997, but ensure that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the staff leaks data from Republican Party senators, "hazardous lies" and "conspiratory theory"
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced the accusations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three senators from the U.S. Republican Party on Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the "ultraright".
“Women, lies and more infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information disseminated included the particular addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the U.S. government, during a Senate panel audience on charges of inadequate sexual conduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak appeared a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Poundt and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed information from a member of Waters staff, communicated the Capitol Hill.
“This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible in any way for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie.”
Waters' statement immediately sparked online reviews, including those of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This lie was angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“He says he has no temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When they accuse someone of something you didn’t do, they shouldn’t get angry.
It should not be challenging.
He should not question the reasons for the accuser.
It must remain pleasant and serenely.”
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's democrats, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during the audience of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to disarm Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“I’m so strong if it were true,” he shared in a tweet.
Waters said his department warned "the entities in charge of compliance with the law and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent accusations.
“We will ensure that we discover the culprits,” he continued, “as well as that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team.”
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), Rowan Atkinson's Unpowerless Spy parody
It is already traditional to seek the transcendence of Brexit in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise of this parody and action comedy by Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it the ironic satire on the matter of evidently stupid that we are in the nation’s new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English's incompetent eye character and rubber face renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comic creation designed for non-English kinetic territories.
Naturally, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims of glamur flatteror, has a little from Clouseau, a little Mr Bean and a piece of that type that contributed a single note on the theme of Carros fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once played on Barclaycard's now forgotten television ads, which he sowed chaos in his passage.
There are a couple of good times on Johnny English's last exit.
I love when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while using a medieval armor suit and the rotor passes make a brief banging against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps into sight, but gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when this kind of "serious" films, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if humor was directed to children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant misfortunes are not as ingenious or concentrated as Atkinson's silent film jokes by embodying Bean's character.
The permanently topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate is inflicted on Britain's network of supersecret web spies and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, for the anguish of the agent who is in service, an unfortunate small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the height for a poor and conflict prime minister, who already suffers a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this character that almost seems Theresa May, but cannot be done much with the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that as all active spies have committed themselves, he must take someone out of retreat.
And that refers to incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but gives extraofficial classes about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency information session and meet with their former and suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a man married to a submarine capta, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the mistakes of His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful deadly femme, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the charismatic technological billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their ridiculous hawks: disguised as waiters, set fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; they create a riot that illegally puts them on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English causes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to get acquainted with the interior of the house of Volta.
Obviously, all arrests come out of the last sequence, but in the kind and scandalous way it is, it seems taken out of a children's television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with Johnny English's other films, couldn't I avoid thinking: can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they cover for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but they cover for five.
The party wants entrepreneurs to spend the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers offering them an additional free day.
The employees would enjoy a weekend of three days, but they would continue to receive the same salary.
The sources say that the idea would "adjust" the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported the four-day rounds a week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A major source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “It is expected to announce a review of policies before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen from day to night, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits the party’s approach to balance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
The Labour Party does not support ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said, “A four-day work week does not enter the party’s policy and is not being considered by this one.”
Chancellor in the Shadow, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of the "nonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
Chancellor's plans in the shadow also imply the possibility that current shareholders of water companies do not recover their entire investment, as a Labour government could carry out "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on business councils and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees, which pay annual dividends for a value of up to ?500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least the final vote on his appointment for the Supreme Court.
On Sunday, on the broadcast of an interview, the reporter of the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said I would go to the audience. I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the accusation came out and asked if he had done it.
He was firm, determined, resounding.”
Graham's vote seems to be immovable.
“My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is determined and would make an explosive accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added to Christine Blasey Ford.
“The people who mentioned could not verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did it do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive star poster that will act and an equally impressive mission, end world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people to go to the Great Lawn Area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event to end poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively combat it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, send an email to a world leader, make a phone call or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
What is the degree of success achieved by Global Citizen 12 years to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to request that measures be taken or is just another case of the so-called "clictivism", people who think it makes a difference when signing an online request or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, driving a set of different goals.
It states that these actions helped stimulate world leaders to announce equivalent commitments and policies to more than $37 billion established to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that so far guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor society and executioners who have committed to “helping children develop to their maximum potential”, with the promise of providing Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,400 tweets from Global Citizen.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a page note of history,” said The Power of Nutrition ambassador, Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in favor of improving the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied, “It will be a long and difficult path and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just as it happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Debarra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to make a “block” to make it difficult for Russia’s energy exports, the U.S. Secretary of Interior announced.
“If it is necessary,” Washington can resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, revealed the U.S. Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at the instances of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the officer, they have the ways and the means to deal with it.
“The United States has the capacity, along with the navy, to ensure that sea roads are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market,” he said.
Zinke was directed to participants in the event organized by Consumer Energy, a non-profit group that is called himself the "user of energy" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, considering that, in practice, it is the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he said, at the same time as he referred to Russia by saying that he “only has a tactic” with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while Trump’s administration was on a mission to boost exports from its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump’s administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “undequate” project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Trump said made Berlin a “cative” of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream pipeline $2 of $11 billion, which was established to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after the meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The US position obtained the reaction of Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German sector-leading organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), appealed to the United States to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine her candidacy for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully examine her presidential candidacy after half-term elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair the fractured government and that includes a woman in power,” he said.
“After November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency.”
Warren opined about President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was "taking this country for the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren said in a tweet, “Of course an FBI investigation is needed before voting.”
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it was shown that most Warren's own voters do not believe he would be presenting in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator would not apply, according to the survey of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for former governor's candidacy, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names in relation to a possible candidacy in 2020, include former vice president, Joe Biden, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, the Associated Press agency reported.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder (TEPT) at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, they arrested and accused him of an incident of domestic violence.
“With my own son is happening, with what’s going on again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of the TEPT and some of the wounds our soldiers return,” he told the audience at a rally in Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo theme and that his son and other war veterans, "returned, hardened, wondering whether there is respect for what fellow militiamen and aviators, as well as other members of the army, offered the country."
They arrested him on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused him of domestic violence about a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon at the same time as he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support a court remedy in relation to a new American policy that denies victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, 18-state representatives and district presented a friendly court report in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of Grace v's claimant side of Sessions' presence. that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Union for Civil Liberties) presented in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He said his partner "and his children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officers rejected their asylum application on July 20.
They stopped it in Texas.
Lawyers from states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, such as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Columbia District Attorney Karl Racine said in a Friday statement that the new policy "igrate decades of state, federal and international legislation".
“Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be harmed according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and this prohibition violates that principle,” he explained in the court’s friendly report.
The prosecutors continued to discuss the report that the policy that rejects the entry of immigrants damage the American economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they "strong labor".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
“The asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his announcement of politics on June 11.
The asylum has never been intended to alleviate all problems (including all serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting more and more.
“The circumstances are very tense,” says the 35-year-old Risa Kusuma mother, comforting her feveric baby in the evacuation center of the town of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance comes with bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed houses, collecting their drowned belongings, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals, damaged by the earthquake magnitude 7.5, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, rested outside of Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes while explaining how he felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel's room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall were crushed, I think," Haris told Associate Press, and added that his family was on a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife ask for help and then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or her daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
US Ambassador accuses China of abuse with “propagandistic matters”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in an American newspaper preaching the benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accuses Beijing of serving the American press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, referred to the Chinese Daily payment supplement at Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa state, after accusing China from entering the US Congress elections, which will be held on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to entertain himself in the U.S. election, marked what officials in that country coined in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coercating China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war witness to the level of tariffs on their respective imports.
According to China and the US experts, China’s compensatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to harm state exporters such as Iowa, which supports Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and Iowa former governor, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing harmed workers, farmers and American entrepreneurs.
In an opinion article written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of Moines Register, China said: “This campaign of harassment is intensifying by spreading propaganda ads in the free American press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the appreciated American tradition of freedom of expression and press when publishing a payment announcement at Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the post of newspapers at the end of this Beijing street, there are few dissident voices and no real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese may have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, since the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he adds.
He also states that "one of China's most important newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not confirm what newspaper it is.
Kavanaugh's disaster loses women's Republican vote a few days in the half-time election.
Although many of the leading Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the different allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially female voters, in the next half-time elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous and most Republicans positioned to move forward with the vote.
“These things cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that doubt that Senator Jeff Flake's last hour for an FBI investigation is enough to calm the moods of angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, as well as they will not forget it in the near future or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre Friday, lead advisor and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group, in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, the grip of "About November!", demonstrated in the Senate runner, while the Republicans, with control of the Judicial Committee, decided to move forward with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
“The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will overcome any expectation,” said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
“It’s already high,
But it will still be more, especially among women indecisive voters in the neighborhoods outside or those who are between 18 and 29 years old, who although they do not like the President, they do not usually go to the polls.
Before Ford's public testimony had detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if the Republicans continued with confirmation.
“This became a disaster for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee president, earlier week on NBC News.
“This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bank of the defendants or not. The problem is how Republicans managed this and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps the election of Democrats on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between believing Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's testimony, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of people surveyed fully or likely create Ford’s testimony, compared to 35% that supports Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh lies during his testimony, compared to 30% who thinks Ford's same.
After the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's charges, as well as those of at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of seriousness when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him the genitals at a college party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web creator wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and that people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee canceled that the intention that Inrupt hides is "dominating the world".
“We have to do it,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal data flow online” or POD.
Contact lists, pending task lists, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools may be included.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify have been available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company calls this as a “personal empowerment through data”.
Inrupt’s idea, according to President John Bruce, is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM-owned security company, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
This week, developers around the world could create their own secentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke with "Facebook or Google about introducing a full change that would modify their business models from one day to another.
“We don’t need your permission.”
In an article published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based website."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has risen as an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era on the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Tribute to Bernard Vann, cleric decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was decorated with the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was assassinated by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had given him the greatest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were in charge of discovering a memorial in his honor in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather's feat that earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion by the Saint-Qutin channel "through a dense fog and under the yoke of intense machine gunfire".
He later rushed to the line of fire and, with a "great courage", led the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without anyone's help, and knock down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was assassinated by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live with, but a lesson still."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a flower crown after the parade, which led the youth band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts the roll to MMA fans at the best time
Imagine you’ve been awake all night to enjoy Bellator 206, and when you get the best part something prevents you.
The San Jose poster included 13 fights, with six being the main ones, and was broadcasting live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald would see the faces, UK viewers were puzzled when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some people didn’t impress them after I spent so many hours waiting to see the fight.
An amateur described the change in these children's drawings on Twitter as "a joke of very bad taste".
“State regulations demand that this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and so it had to be changed to child programming,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Marketing and Communication of Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said he will take into account UK viewers in future programming.
“I think we can solve it when we think about repetition,” Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. there, we can’t fix it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
We are working to find a solution.
When the change occurred, I started receiving many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won’t happen again.
We will limit ourselves to five fights, instead of six. We want to give the most to our fans, but we pass and
It hurts a lot of anger.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior due to her sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, claims that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete says he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he arrived at high school.
Guest of the first broadcast of the Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this program, is low due to illness.
As a guest of the first program led by Laverne, Daley shared that she felt "inferor" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked children."
He said, “To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what has driven me and gave me the strength necessary to achieve success.”
I wanted to prove that it was “someone” so that people had not felt disappointed when discovering their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Commonwealth games of Australia to call for more countries that had decriminalized homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt lucky to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
Three-time world champion said he fell in love with the American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was a surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
“When you live so much in such a short time” (at the age of 14 he first participated in an Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone of your age who had experienced similar highs.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley totally change his perspective.
“If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal,” he said.
“But now I know there are much more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley's father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things his son asked his son were tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell you I wouldn’t be here to take that front row,” Daley said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that precise moment, at the time of his death, when I realized that he was not really invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“At that moment I knew that was my life’s dream: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,” he said.
Heather Small's Proud song is not in vain, as it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on the tip.

A low-shaped Mickelson finished in Ryder Cup bank this Saturday.
Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but must improve his technique so that he does not become an unhappy event.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for 12th time, stayed in the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the football or on Saturday's funerals.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day encouraging and working to improve his movements.
Although it was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the height of his career, at the age of 48 he did not fit the tight Le Golf National field, where the high grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And if this wasn't enough, Mickelson faces the ninth Sunday match to the precise Francesco Molinari, British Open winner, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of the 12 individual games, start with good foot, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his husband, although he couldn’t say much more.
“He perfectly understood the role he played today, gave me a palm on my shoulder, passed my arm and told me that tomorrow I would be ready,” Furyk shared.
“I fully trusted in myself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has brought a lot to teams last and this week.
I probably didn’t think I had played two games.
I thought I would play more, but in the end it was things and so we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
He could score the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual palmers.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangible to the team.
“He’s a fun person, sarcastic, with a swarm and likes to get involved with people, he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he said.
“I like to see how good the youngest players have happened with him this week.
He’s much more with a good player.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears for the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows for experience that a considerable advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup individual can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Grand Danish debuted in 1997 in a match in Valderama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually reached the finish line with a minimum advantage winning 141-131 .
“You’re thinking we had a great advantage in Valdederma; just like Brookline, where we lost, but in Valdederama we won for a little,” Bjorn reflects in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at the Le Golf National.
The story shows that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go for everyone.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are on the scoreboard.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I won’t get tired of saying, I’m focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I’m also very aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted with the performance of his players on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we are facing another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and we also have to prove our worth.
It’s great to be with a partner next when things go well, but when you face things individually, then test your ability as a golfer.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, which get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must take the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will find that his players have a better individual performance than with his teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those turns of the last day, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but ending up as a loser after the European miracle in Medinah.
"I remember each of the damn words," replied when asked if he remembered as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players around the last day.
“We have 12 important games, but you would like to have a quick start like Brookline or that of Medinah.
When you see that the impulse goes in a direction, there is a lot of pressure on these intermediate parties.
We prepare our alignment by taking this into account and put players as it seemed, we want to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, at the top half of the standings.
“I decided this order because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn explained about his selection for the individual.
The new German warship postponed once again
The German Navy's youngest frigate should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not reach until at least next year due to defective systems and at the increasing cost, local media reported.
The post of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman for the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but the problems following delivery affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-Bürttemberg-class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the former Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as concealment technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy younger frigates up to two years outside ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that it will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a boat to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but German media spoke of "sponderent defects in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, as Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel needed in the former Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The Rheinland-Pfalz of 7,000 tons is thought to weigh twice as much as the German-class ships used in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the total price of the project, which includes crew formation, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it has already reached the amazing amount of €3100 million, compared to the initial 22 billion.
The problems of the younger frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is making water.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships suitable to deploy.
The officer claims that this problem is increasing, as old ships were removed, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust Spys the Secret Life of Bats
A new research that is being conducted on a farm in Scotland’s Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to seek food.
The results are expected to tear light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland association will follow Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bat Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in Winterwe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
A sound analysis by experts from all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
Then, a habitat map will be developed to create a detailed image on the scale of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that results show that habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as prairie creation and what is the best way to keep forests for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and habitat loss.
Aerogenerators and lighting also pose a risk, as well as flies glue traps, some chemical treatments of construction materials, and domestic cat attacks.
The bats are not blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is taken very seriously by bats.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct surveys periodically, child inspections and sometimes even rescues.
The organization even has the only and first reserve of Scottish bats in Threavate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
David Thompson, the Manager of Estate, says this is the ideal territory for them.
“We have a large area for bats,” he said.
“We count on old buildings, historical trees and a great habitat.
But there are many things we still don’t know about bats, so the work we carry out here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks in the properties, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity child can kill up to 400 females and young, which could exterminate a entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or bother them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
“There is still a lot to learn about bats and, in the case of many species, we don’t know how it’s going to their populations.”
Ronaldo dismisses the demands for rape and his lawyers prepare to demand German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo calls rape complaints against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get to know using their name.
His lawyers will call for the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these accusations.
The front of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is said that the footballer paid the woman 375 000 USD to say nothing about the incident, he published Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after its release, Ronaldo, 33, found this false news in a live video since his Instagram account, which counts 142 million followers.
“No, not a thousand times.
What was said today is false,” he said the five-time winner of the Golden Ball.
“People want to get to know them using my name.
It is normal,
They want to be famous with just saying my name, it’s part of my work.
I am a happy and respectable man,” the player said smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they call it "an unacceptable statement of suspicions in the privacy area" according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz said the player would apply for compensation for "moral owners for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights of recent years".
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019, in a suite of the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal, according to the documents presented at the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, knelt down saying he was 99 percent a gentleman, but that 1% betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that both had sex consented by both parties.
Mayorga also argues that he went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because he felt terrified of retaliation and was concerned about the public scarlet.
The 34-year-old woman says she seeks to revoke the agreement while continuing to traumatize the alleged incident.
At the time of alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Car manufacturers would leave the UK
The UK would forever regret the loss of its position as a world car manufacturing leader after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK had said on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, he temporarily stopped the production of its Burnaston factory near Derby.
“We need to reach an agreement,” Clark added.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that, in case Brexit had not reached any agreement, the impact of border delays could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, responsible for manufacturing Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the EU.
“If Britain leaves the EU in late March, we will be witnesses of how production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, director general of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the operation of trade between borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain if a Brexit deal is not reached.
Toyota’s production line is very tight, every 37 minutes come from UK and EU suppliers for custom cars.
If on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and delays and shortages of pieces could be generated.
The company claims it would be impossible for Toyota to have maintained a normal pace more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future EU relations is “expected accurately to avoid such controls on the border.”
“It’s essential to have an agreement. And we want it to be the best deal, so to enjoy the current success but also make the most of this opportunity,” he said in the BBC Radio 4 show.
“The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains.”
Toyota could not estimate how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term added costs would reduce plant competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, Burnaston's employee for 24 years and Unite trade union coordinator, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "For experience, I know that once these works disappear, they never return.
A government spokesman said they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
The White House said Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting and the undersecretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed for another week due to the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, links between Russian and Trump assistants, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump dismisses the deputy attorney general, as if he did not, which would endanger Mueller's independence, fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, including reports that he was about to resign.
A meeting with Trump was announced, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to say goodbye to Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate court committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accused him of inappropriate sexual conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week investigation to the FBI on allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied, "There is not yet a fixed date, could be this week or delay one more week, given everything that is happening in the supreme court.
We’ll see, but you know I like the press to be informed.”
Some journalists questioned that claim, as Sanders has been taking since September 10 without celebrating a press conference.
When the presenter Chris Wallace asked him the reason,
Sanders said that the lack of information session was not due to an aversion to the grandiloquence of reporters, although he added that she will not be the one who denies that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president grants more interviews than the previous president,” he said, although he did not quote any source that had endorsed that data.
Information meetings will continue to be held, but he insisted that “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that’s much better than directing the questions to her.
You are witnesses of how we’ve been doing this for the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference in which we can speak directly to the President of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when leaving the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with worthy visitors.
However, solo press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the reason this week in New York, with a free and strange appearance before the journalists gathered.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm the moods against Brexit
The Health Secretariat has addressed a letter to EU workers in the NHS of Scotland in which it expresses the country’s gratitude and communicates its desire to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months that the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has committed to covering the cost of requests for status covered for EU citizens working on their decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment continued, and decisions are expected to achieve this autumn.
However, the UK government, on the other hand, also intensified its preparations for a possible non-deal situation.
I know this is a period of concern for everyone.
I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the members of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Members of the European Union and beyond contribute an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health service work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.”
Christion Abercrombie subjected to emergency surgery after head injury
Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, was subjected to emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's defeat (31-27) against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessean reported.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State coach, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
He seemed to get into the band line.
Coaches and medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on the camel to perform a later assessment.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He also added that there are no details of the type or reach of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year-old red-shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tickets in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised his total of the season to 18.
A bell tax will be applied to foreign buyers who buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher bell tax when buying a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help homeless people under new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of the Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
Increased tax will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher bell tax when buying a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible homes and focus on people with high income.
The increase in timbre tax will apply to people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will serve to support the government’s campaign to reduce the number of people who sleep on the street.
The collection, which is added to the current timbre tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second homes and purchases to rent, may be up to 3%.
The change is expected to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of new constructions in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, which is causing a price increase and making it difficult for people who want to buy for the first time a home have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson requested the application of a cut in farm transmission tax to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused the large builders of keeping high housing prices through the purchase of soil and non-use of it, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the percentages of tax incomes on moderate price homes to fix the "feasing of the housing sector" that is lived in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposals for reforms related to the house, including the control of rents and the ban on the challenges in which the tenant is not to blame.
It also wants to give the largest powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restore the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
This is why we need to fix the market.
Britain will always be open to what you want to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as simple for those who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, buy homes that for British workers residents.
For too many people, the dream of being owners of a house is too far away, and the unworthy that it means not having a roof remains too real.”
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross stated that his "last ambition" is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
This 42-year-old Scots is enjoying the challenge of reviving the club in the northwest, which currently occupies the third place in the League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“When I was a player, my dream was playing for my country.
I played once in the B selection, and that was all,” Ross told the BBC Scotland’s Sportsound show.
“I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I’m successful driving a club.”
Ross's predecessors in Sunderland's coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic claims that he felt no concern about succeeding those such consolidated figures in a club so large after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The success for me will depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the club’s structure and facilities are undoubtedly typical of a Premier League club,” he said.
“It won’t be a simple task to get there, but it’s likely that I only think I’ve achieved success here if I can return the club to the Premier.”
Ross only takes three years as a coach after a period of assistant at the Dumbarton and a period of 15 months within Hearts' technical staff.
At that period, he helped the Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get the St Mirren from being about to descend to win the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than he never met during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“I was probably at a real crossroads,” he recalled, taking over the Alloa.
“I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
Sounds weird because it wasn’t bad, I have reasonably won life well and enjoyed some successes.
Playing can be tough.
There are many things you need to overcome every week.
I still get them related to stress and work pressure, but I like to train.
I’ve always loved training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a pint is at 5:30 a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The pubs and bars experienced a rise of 2.7 percent during July, but consumption in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA commercial adviser, in charge of compiling the figures, stated: "The sunny days and the permanence of England in the most time than expected caused a standard similar to the month of June, in which pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although restaurants suffered even greater punishment.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the turnover of restaurants in June worsened during July.
The pubs and bars specialized in beverages were the best results achieved with increases in consumption higher than reductions experienced by restaurants.
Pubs specialized in meals also suffered the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just want to drink.
In pubs and controlled bars, drinking consumption increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food was reduced by three percent.
Paul Newman, an employee of the RSM company for leisure and hospitality activities, said: “These results pose a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events remain the main factors related to consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a drop of 4.8 percent annually will be especially painful if that is added the continued increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have reached a worse time for catering business and time will be in charge of saying whether the moderation of the temperatures experienced during August will provide the so necessary breath for the sector.
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, which reflects slowdown in brand launches.
The UK’s sales indicator Coffer Peach Tracker Industry in the public, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with joint profits of more than 9,000 million pounds and is considered the reference point of the sector.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents.
One in five children (some only 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey.
A survey conducted at 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of pages of "Fake Insta"
This has led to increased fear of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “principal” account to show their parents.
One in five children (some only 11 years old) are creating social media accounts that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted by 20,000 high school students highlighted a growth in the number of accounts of "Fake Insta" (in reference to the social network of Instagram photo exchange).
This has led to an increase in fear of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students claimed they used a softened "principal" account to show their parents while having other private ones.
A mother who met her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked her to "violent".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to have private accounts.
HMC manager Mike Buchanan said: “It is alarming that there are so many teenagers tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the advice of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the advice of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys enormous respect within the Scottish community, the United Kingdom and globally, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit greatly from its incorporation into the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I am very eager to make a spokesperson for athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help direct the sport in Scotland.”
The American, which won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games among a total of four Olympic golds and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented him from being able to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and to what extent.
It was a exhausting job, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and now I do agility exercises.
Thanks for the messages of encouragement.”
An announcement of a maternal milk extractor compared to women with cows divides public opinion in networks
A company of maternal milk extractors has divided public opinion on networks with an ad in which it compares to lactating mothers with cows to which they are muxining.
To announce the launch of the proclaimed "first silent portable breast milk extractor in the world", Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a musical video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new milk extractor to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ugly for cows at the rhythm of a song with lyrics like the following: "Yes, I move to myself, but I have no tail" and "If you don't realize it, they're not your breasts."
The choir continues: "Women, move, I'm feeding the babies, muxe, muxe, I'm dying my friends."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that it highlights the "horres" of the dairy sector.
“Utizing cows to announce this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in their case we steal their children days after giving birth,” one wrote.

Another viewer commented on the following: "Clarly traumatic to the mother and baby.
But why aren’t they used to announce a milk extractor for mothers who stay with their babies?”
Another viewer added: “What an announcement with such little touch.”
Other spectators defended the announcement, even a woman claimed that the song seemed "very funny".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I were still giving my chest, I would buy one.
Getting my milk made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is a bit silly, but I interpret it as a joke.
It seems like a great product,” he wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun announcement directed to mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feel like "vacas".
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be discreetly fit into a maternal subjectator, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and creative director of Mother commented on the following: "The extractor Elvie is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By describing the parallelism between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it entails while demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This is not the first time that Elvie has occupied the headlines of the newspapers.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved silently to camp on Texas border
The number of immigrant children arrested increased despite the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part due to rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration hampered the allocation of godparents for children.
Traditionally, most godparents were also known immigrants and were afraid to endanger their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claiming a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior position of the U.S. Customs and Control Service, testified to Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who requested to sponsor minors without a company.
The agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal record.
“I think of 80% of people who are godparents or who are part of the home of these are illegally found in the country, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
We will continue to pursue these individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children faster, officials introduced new rules that will require any of these compassion in the court before a month has elapsed since their arrest rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the workers of the shelter.
Many will appear by videoconference rather than in person to try to legalize their case against an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they will have to become anxious or depressed, which can cause violent regrets or attempts to flee according to the shelter workers and reports of the system published over the past months.
Lawyers have claimed that these fears increase in larger centers such as Tornillo, in which there is more chance than the symptoms that a child is passing through it badly go unnoticed due to their size.
They also added that moving the children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them from an emotional point of view or to say goodbye to friends could pose a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls for occupation forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, heading to the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Vice Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were illegally Syrian alone, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "occuate them in the timely manner".
“They must withdraw immediately and without conditions,” he said.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011 and millions of them had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to "fighting this sacred battle until we clean all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "of all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this country devastated by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the right conditions for their return and blamed the "some Western countries" of the "disfusion of irrational fears" that caused refugees to not return.
“We are running to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warned that they will not offer help for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and opposition occurs to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib allowed to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by Russia-backed Syrian troops in the province, in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "two clear limit" and expressed his hope that military actions would be aimed at Shihadists, including soldiers of the Al-Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, which will be eradicated".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of government and opposition to develop a draft of a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem exposed the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned in the face of possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals will be waiting, impeachment and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
It would be “The most dramatic end of a presidency.”
There are no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, prime-time audience rates have multiplied by more than two, to reach 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators at first-time hours, an increase of 1.7 million compared to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program led the audience indexes of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the nights on which important news occurred.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, showrunner of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", which deals with a ministerial cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nel Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Singing the Hollywood Boys" has another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He replied, "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment within chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the plots that arise from Washington can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, if immigrant families can reunite again and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it supposes something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spending six hours watching a panel of experts debate about Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-doled ostrich skin jacket, Paul Manafort ("a gift full of arrogance" said.
I won’t look at Super Mario again the same way.
“Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it’s giving you something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, a senior executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” a space that deals with changes in characters and the daily argument spins of the Trump show (the conflict with the N.F.L., the praises to Kim Jong-un).

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, I made sun and a temperature of 26 degrees off the house, on the north coast of Kauai, but was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to disengage while Brett Kavanaugh was about to confront the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs at that time and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

External money comes to moraines to finance the House nominations for the elections of half the legislature
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two acting representatives in the race to occupy the same position.
This district outside Pittsburgh that was recently reorganized is represented by the Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who got his place in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is presented against another acting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superimposed on the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was determined in January that Republicans manipulated the electoral constituency of the old districts in their favor.
The electoral race in the new 17th congressional district unleashed a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee of Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after achieving a tight victory in the March special elections for the 18th congress district of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a broad follow-up.
That post has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won in the district for 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States valued the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for their support for China and then went back.
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners threw the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the State Department decided to order the heads of U Salvador's US diplomatic missions, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert said, the department spokesman in a statement made this same month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in US aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment rates and murders.
As internal meetings progressed, American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focused on safety and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the emigration of people to the United States.
But in mid-September, important administration officials made it clear that they wished the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of applying sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to direct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance granted by the administration, the diplomats said.
The three American envoys returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about internal deliberations as long as the participants were anonymous.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration and he also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Studying History
The next negative case could be the report by special advisor Robert Mueller about the case of possible obstruction of Mr. Trump’s justice, of which there are currently abundant evidence in the public archive.
Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation to find out if Mr. Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia in his attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump must pay accounts in that body, just when he has to prepare for elections, and he may eventually have to face a popular jury.
They are many unknowns and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, just like that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were determined to take a coup against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of killings that occurred later.
The course of history revolves around those turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy accelerates or backward.
Americans face several of these turning points at this time.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses State Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller’s research destination?
Rosenstein has been carrying with water to his neck since the newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was disabled for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the information of The Times is not true.
“How will we answer whether the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not impartial or whether your appointment is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the credible accusations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And above all, will we vote in the half-registration elections for a Congress that requires responsibilities to Mr. Trump?
If we don’t overcome these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my house, which was the seat of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to arrest Shabat candize on that table that included a swastic.
With that inheritance, how will I not be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers Graham Dorrans player is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receives the Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw achieved in Spain against Villarreal this same month, would put them in a very favorable position to qualify in the G group of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans debut this season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but believes the Rangers can use that result as a trampoline to achieve more important things.
“It was a good point for us, as Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old player said.
“We learned that we could get something positive and we got a point.
We had the opportunity to win at the end, but in general, the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to be able to get the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last game, but with the support of our audience, I am sure we can fight to achieve a positive result.
Last year was hard among everything that happened with my injuries and the changes produced in the team, but there is an excellent environment at this time.
The team is good, the kids are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget the last season and succeed.”
Women are worried about the savings for their retirement.
Despite the fact that participants in the survey were clear how they wanted them to take care of them, few people spoke to their family on the matter.
About half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide said they commented with their couples the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
“People want her to care for a family member, but they are not carrying out the necessary measures to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance department.
They can start with the next one.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to care if you don’t tell them your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your advisor and family to agree where and how to receive care, as those decisions can be a determining factor when determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Among the extended care financing options are a traditional prolonged care insurance policy, an effective hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-safety covered with your own funds, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Provide a health care representative to designate a trusted person to overcome your medical care and make sure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
It also appreciates the possibility of signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You must choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your father or older mother has a medical emergency and goes on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who attend it?” Martin asked.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Establish a plan.”

The agents described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim did not see the aggressor.
His injuries are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure expected to continue to rise.
Due to the court of communications, rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area located north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 degrees magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key data on Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Celebes Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Celebes Island, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that lies over more than 300 km of coastline northwest of Celebes Island.
This regency, an administrative region less than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the Central Celebes province's economy, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times during the last 100 years according to Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Fire Belt of high seismic activity, so it suffers from earthquakes regularly.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia in northern Sumatra, which occurred on 26 December, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, ahead of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, causing the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 degrees magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake of magnitude affected the Mentawai Islands, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of peoples and caused the death of approximately 300 people.
2016: A soft earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's regency, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people recalled the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami occurred this time, but more than 100 people died due to the fall of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily pulled away.
Sarah Palin's eldest son on allegations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, 29, natural from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested suspected of a crime of domestic violence, preventing the presentation of a complaint for domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin remains in pretrial detention in the dependencies of Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bond, according to the KTUU.
He was presented before the court on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, of course" when he was asked, the chain reported.
Palin faces three minor crimes of type A, which means he could enter prison until a year and receive a $50,000 fine.
He was also charged with a minor B-type crime, punishable with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been held against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaskan War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic aggression, preventing the presentation of a complaint for domestic violence and possession of firearms in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of holding a punch on his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome that suffers after serving the army in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake of magnitude caused a tsunami destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not available, and the death balance is expected to increase over the days.
The earthquake occurred just in front of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on the social networks that show the time of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal failures seek to apply a few times applied death penalty for suspect in a terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway Avenue, sealing the life of the pawns and cyclists he found on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intently" and that caused them serious injuries "intently", according to the notification of the intention of a death penalty application presented in the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes imply the possibility of applying the death penalty according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack occurred, a federal jury presented Saipov an imputation of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by prosecutors of organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "noble planning and premeditation", the prosecutors declared in describing the way Saipov carried out the "atroz, cruel and depraved" attack.
Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, as indicated in the notification of accusation intention.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago, the Southern District of New York does not process a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, demonstrated lack of repentance during the days and months following the attack according to court documents.
He told researchers who felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the IIS videos he visualized on his phone according to the accusation.
He also asked to see the IIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He was not guilty of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal lawyers in charge of representing Saipov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the accusation.
“We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accepting a declaration of guilt with life imprisonment without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to request the death penalty.
Tory MP said NIGEL FRAGE should be placed in front of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize a "people army" today during a protest at the tory conference.
Former UK independence Party leader said politicians had to "untie pressure" from the Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that it should take care of negotiations with the EU.
Ordinary deputy Peter Bone said in front of the Birmingham demonstration that the UK would be “out” of the EU if Mr. Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May to reconcile the divided ranks of her party was evident in joining the Tories in favour of joining the Tories in the EU to an independent Brexit protest held in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain the commitments of her Chequers plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, the opposites and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continued to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Europeans and Labour to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated in the concentration of the Leave Means Leave movement of Solihull who wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been counted to take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If I had been in office, we would be out of the EU right now,” he said.
Wellingborough Parliament member added: “I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort Chequers’ plan.”
Showing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We do not fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone denied suggestions indicating that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely false.”
Brexit shop member Andrea Jenkyns also went to the march, from which he told reporters: “The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity among public opinion, the opposition will not vote for it, is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Sing Chequers’ plan and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: “The prime ministers retain their works when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farage stated in the concentration that it is necessary to make “unextables” to politicians if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray the Brexit decision and here we are gathered today to tell them we won’t let them go out with their own.”
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the army of people in this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous UK.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU carried out a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour concentration in the city center.
A few activists waved banners with the Tories Against Brexit message after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for security problems they suffered in a party's implementation at the beginning of the conference.
“This is the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a frictionless borderless border border, to enjoy free market without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s an absolute farce.
The concept of good Brexit does not exist,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously think about running for the presidency
American Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously think her presidential candidacy after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts's Democrat spoke about its future on Saturday during a municipal session in a western Massachusetts town.
Warren, a frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, will be re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It is the focus of speculations that place it as Trump’s successor in 2020.
Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with its voters using the municipality format since Trump took over the presidency.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it’s time that “Women go to Washington to fix our government’s problems, and for that it makes a woman fail in the position of the presidency.”
An arrest was held related to Sims' death shooting, the LSU player
Baton Rouge Police, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the assassination of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson arrest in a press conference held at 11:00 (east time).
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who came out in the images.
Yes, 20 years old, was shot dead near the Southern University campus in the early hour of Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound on his head and eventually died as a result of it,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde played to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present in the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody in East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2-meter youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 titles last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel.
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who stopped from pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton only while defending his position during the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first pitted and left Hamilton running with traffic on the back of the group, something that would be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in pits a lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced him after several wheel-wheeled maneuvers that caused Ferrari driver to leave the interior free at risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver in the third corner.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the starting grid and climbed to seventh place at the end of the first lap on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a large part of this thanks he retained his tyres to get to go faster in the final part and advance Kimi Raikkonen for fourth position.
He finally entered pits on lap 44 but was unable to advance any position in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job throughout the weekend and was a true gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two places,” Hamilton said.
An inappropriate body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday event on his insistence on his insistence that he had not filtered Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In a speech in an act in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly from Ford's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee and commented in his place that what was happening in the Senate proved that people were "miserable, disgusting and liar".
“The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate, when the outrage is seen, when it is seen that the people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying,” he said.
“When you see these posts and leaks and they say, “Oh, I didn’t go.
I didn’t go.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you do any leak?
Remember your answer... you filtered the document?: "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't go.
Wait for a moment.
“No,” he said, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent him the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak coming from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I did not filter his story,” Feinstein told the committee according to the newspaper The Hill.
“I asked him to keep his confidentiality and did what he asked me.”
But his denial did not seem to sit well at the president, who commented the following during the Saturday night act: “I tell you that body language was not the right one.
I may not filter it, but I used the worst body language I’ve seen in my life.”
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of inadequate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power through any necessary means.
They are evil and disgusting, they don’t care who they harm, who have to run over to regain power and control,” said the president according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat suffered on Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants winning the 5-3 game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored an early lead by two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied to the local set before Dyyer re-established the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to go back to win the Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three previous victories for the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal occurred in the 3:35 minute thanks to an assistance from Kendall McFaull, and the second arrived four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assistance.
In an early period, Sullivan returned to put the local team in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to score the goal of the draw on 15:16.
Dwyer said the Giants were ahead of the scoreboard before the first break when they scored their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team re-grouped and Bouchard again tied the game with a goal by power play in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined with each other to help Nielsen advance Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured the victory through his team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home at Milton Keynes their next game, which will be held on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers from a plane can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered a hero after dying to make sure a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many missing after a major earthquake shook Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to be felt in the area and many people are trapped under the rubbles of the city of Palu.
Although his co-workers fled to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport control tower that was violently swinging.
He was in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the exit track at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought he was going to knock down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said this decision would allow hundreds of lives to be saved, Australia’s ABC News channel reported.
We prepared a Balikpan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Let’s get our hearts when we know each other,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death balance can be thousands and the country’s disaster management agency said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The balance of victims is believed to continue to increase because there are many bodies under the rubble and could not have reached many of them,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugro, the agency’s spokesman.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are carrying help and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “A minute an ambulance is bringing bodies every minute.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are plundering the mini-markets.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross Indonesia is struggling to help the survivors, but we don’t know what’s going to be found there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could become much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and communicated to the country's military: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia suffered earthquakes this year in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing one after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing one after previously stating that the 47 passengers and crew had left without incident the plane being sunk.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that from Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working together with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers continued in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of the events remains unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy confirmed that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed the runway long.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered very little height.
“That’s extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to advance between the water that reached the waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also recalled that the flight assistants were screaming and frightened, and that he suffered a slight wound on his head.
The United States Navy indicated that sailors who were working near the place in the tasks of improving a dock also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to move people to the coast before the plane sank approximately 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but none affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors were sent to the test on Saturday at the repetition of a man's trial accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett tested for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described for the jury as he used the records of a mobile phone to recompose the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the victim of 19, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death contradicting his previous claims as the newspaper The Clarion Ledger reported.
When this data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he declared that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "while, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction consisted that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they were only known for a week.
Rowlett stated that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis removed the messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“I’m a bit of her life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would be seen for judgment by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a group of Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and fighting social problems.
They want to return to their roots and get back to fight hip hop to be popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A young woman in New York calls for a couple after a "racist" message
A caregiver of New York children will demand a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from the mother in which she complained that she was "other black".
The couple refuses to be racist and compares demand with an “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her distress by discovering that the child caregiver Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON, OUTRA," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that the caregiver she had just gone, that she was African-American, had done badly her job and that he expected a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice paid her work day and sent her home in an Uber.
Maurice will now sue the couple to gain compensation for the dismissal and demands a compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for those who had been initially hired even if there was no contract by means.
“Look, I want to show them that these things are not done,” he told the Post on Friday, to add later, “It’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusations of racism stating that saying goodbye to Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid not to trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent him a message that I didn’t intend to send him.
He is not racist.
We are not racist,” Joel Plasco said to the Post.
“But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, though it was due to a mistake?
Your baby was born?
Come on!"
After comparing the demand with a "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that he was in a "very difficult situation".
“Will you go for a person like that?
That’s not very ethical,” the investment banker added.
While the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them for their behavior and logic applied.
Paddington editors feared that readers did not identify with a second speaker bear if it can be completed in a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented the following about the letter: "It is hard to put yourself on the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It’s fun to know what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
After claiming that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility that his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agrried" after his death last year.
De Paddington, which he describes as a "very important member of our family", added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
“He was a silent man and nothing presumptuous,” he said.
“But because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as if you had a son who got something: you’re proud even if you didn’t really do it.
I think I felt Paddington’s success a little bit that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave Paddington himself all the merit.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
After landing, his daughter was quickly driven to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save his life.
“Nad regularly called to say it was very bad, that it was not expected to survive.
"Then I got Nad's call to tell me I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you a lot, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors had given him so that his heart continued beating were slowly consuming and abandoning his body.
He had died a while before and was now turning off.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to endure.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapereuse, at that time of mourning for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without the warmth she was suffering.
“No one found it,” he said.
“I had my head down and I fell tears at all times.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive sense of solidarity for Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Postcards of women afflicted to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiration messages and phone numbers that can be called to ask for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began suffering depression, and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel like I have to feel every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said their smile was lighting any room.”
He left the job before he died and was “in a very deep depression.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, “I have a continuous concern that a collateral effect occurs.”
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people who can go to and talk to, even if she's a friend.
Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“I didn’t tell myself that I was sad or depressed or anything like that,” he said.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we detected a change in your attitude.
Christmas day was deep (when the children opened their gifts, they made no visual contact with them or nothing).
He claimed that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "He took off the family.
I mean them.
We have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs from a thread while the FBI begins research
“I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking (a investigation for a limited time and limited scope), it is possible that we could get a little unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "surreting himself" due to the paralysis of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathizers want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Their reluctance is due to a matter of deadlines.
Five weeks left for the half-registration elections (November 6). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man who wishes for the country's highest court.
George W. Bush was calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI will carry out his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently occupy 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea is down under Kim's mandate
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has been reduced from Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a legislator in South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, said 1,127 desertions had occurred last year, far from 2,706 of 2011.
Mr. Park said the hardening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people in charge of passing people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
Most North deserters are finally offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul declares that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the largest border stretch with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriate them.
Relations between the north and south (which technically continue at war) have improved significantly over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met at Pyongyang to maintain talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This took place after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, in which they agreed to work to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States of lack of progress since then.
“If we have no confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility that we draw up unilaterally first,” Mr. Ri said in a speech given to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and claims it is not suitable for accessing the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House, Nancy Peloi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and assured that it was not suitable for his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview conducted on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman ever behaved in that way, they would call it hysterical,” Pelosi said on his reaction to Kavanaugh's statement in front of the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse about Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and talking while describing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, cataloging the accusations against him as a "ssigned of grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals angry by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Peloi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because he demonstrated that he had prejudices against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if it was confirmed in the post and if Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“What I have to say is as follows: if you are not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it is not suitable for being not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court in which it is currently found,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the patient protection law and accessible health care or Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation view, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would cancel.
“It’s not the time for a hysterical person and prejudice to access the court and even above hope we say, look well!” said Peloi.
Women need to exercise it.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and cannot expel it without crying.
“We’ve been angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s so weird, right?”
He continued to say, "I received a lot of help from a woman who was executive somewhere, who said he also cried when he was angry, but that he developed a technique that consisted of, when he was angry and started crying, he told the person he was talking to: "You're best thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
I am angry.”
And then, he continued.
It seemed brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my most sharp memories in one of my first works in a men-dominated office, in which I began to cry with an impossible anger to describe, was that a older woman grabbed me from the back of the neck, a distant superior who had always provoked me a slight fear, and led me to the hollow of the stairs.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you are sad and that they will comfort you.”
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Colorado Democratic Congressman, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was picked up on an adventure outside the marriage on a boat named Monkey Business and was retired from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider the idea of running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-deserved decision,” he told me about laughter 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancaneves and the seven dwarves."
Because the campaign was advanced, it had a delay in fundraising, so he swore he would not enter the race for the presidency unless it could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of those who supported her contributed $11,000 to male candidates would only contribute $250.
“What do you think, what do I have off?” he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported it, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters rather than delegates and anger for existing sexism) that remained speechless.
“You would think he had suffered a nervous crisis,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted with her.
“You would think Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
"He smelled?"
How can trade war between the United States and China be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the U.S. and China trade war have been grafting and, although the war is far from ending, a distance between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, launched the first warning earlier this year by recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $200 billion, recording half of the articles coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has counterattacked at a time the same way, the most recent rising rates of five to ten percent by $60,000 million in American products.
China has promised to imitate American measures and seems unlikely that the world’s second largest economy will switch in the short term.
To get Washington to get Washington back, it would be necessary to give in to its demands, but publicly doubled to the United States would be much more shameful for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts claim that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favor China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions needed to start an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-centric researcher at the Center for New American Security, a study center.
Syria is “list” for refugees to challenge, the foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the country's conditions are improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now all the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive U.S. defeat in European territory and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who offered the most battle during the tournament, sent the ball to water in hole 16 p.m., losing his departure against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shone in all of his series, becoming one of the only four players to achieve a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was implemented in 1979.
Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the player with the worst ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The first ranking in the world's ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against English Ian Poulter, which is possible to play his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups played, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with the most wins of the tournament, with 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry often, but I can’t help it today.
It was a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for selecting and believing in me.
I am so happy to be able to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I am happy to be able to have helped,” García said after the European victory.
He passed the testimony to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat the American legend of Tiger Woods golf by 2&1 in the individual game on Sunday.
“It’s amazing how proud I feel today because I could have defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that boy play,” Rahm said.
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
It is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, winner of 14 majors, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had problems all weekend not to leave the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a golf of a high caliber throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk declared after his team's frustrating performance: "I am proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning, the Europeans were in trouble.
Let's fight.
I take off the hat before Thomas.
He is an excellent captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will go ahead.
I want these 12 guys and I am proud to be a captain.
It's to take off the hat.
They were superior.”
Red tide information: Concentrations are being reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the most recent report by the Florida Wildlife and Fisheries Commission, a general reduction in red tide concentrations is being produced in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the aforementioned commission, increasingly unequal conditions are being observed in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which may mean that the concentrations are being reduced.
The red tide extends approximately 210 km from the coast from the northern counties of Pinellas to those of southern Lee.
There are 16 km away from the Hillsboroug count coast, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Red tide was also found in the county of Pasco.
It has been reported from the presence of middle-level concentrations on the coast or far from the coast of Pinellas County last week, bottom and high concentrations away from the coast of Hillsborough County, background and high concentrations in or far from the coast of Sarasota, background and middle-level concentrations in Charlotte County, bottom and high concentrations in or far from the coast with Lee County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier are informed that cases of respiratory irritation continue to occur.
No such case was reported in northwestern Florida last week.
