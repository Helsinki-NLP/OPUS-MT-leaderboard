Murdons decorate the urns in referring to change the country's name
The electors will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to solve a dispute that last decades with neighbour Greece, which has a Province called Madonia.

St. Martin's bells keep silent while Harlem's churches are still fighting
"The elders I told you that there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, not one thing or the other.
He said he could understand that the bars had disappeared.
"Now people socialize other ways," he said.
"The bares are no longer the locals to be in the neighborhoods that people are often."
At churches, I fear that the money of active sale don't hesitate as much as the leaders are waiting, and "people or later they'll come back wherever they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with landown communities full of the sort of people who wouldn't help the neighborhoods to stay healthy.
"The immense majority of the people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he declared, "and therefore will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the young owners will be made members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St Martin a decade later.
The original white methodistic congregation has changed in the '30s.
A close black congregation was made with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation imprisoned by the reverend John Johnson, who led a barrel to the stores of Rue 115, a commercial street of Harlem who was resenting and ascending to black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damage, but as the stockings of the father Johnson did plans to reconstruct it, they took the quilion.
When reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and his successor in St. Martin, he's taken over with pride as the poor bells.
The expert that played the quarillion in July called it differently, "a cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument in replaceable."
The Tiffany Ng at Michigan University... has also realized that it was the first truck in the world... played by a black musician, Dionissio A. Lind, who changed him by the biggest quarillion of the Church Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one cared about your place in St. Martin.
For the last few months, they're a group of architects and contractors, some taken by the headlines of the church and others for the epistopal diasis.
The parish meeting, the organe that recuts the parish, and which is betent of lasic leadership, wrote to diaces itself in July by pursuing his worry why this last "thread recuting costs" to the board, although it had not been attended in the contracting of the architects and the oppositeists which he sent to diace.
Some of you've got the lack of transparency on the dictatorship.

Besides, the perfumes store, the Fragance Shop, will prove concessions in two establishments of Saisbry's; the first opened in Croydon, in the south of London, last week, while the second one will open in Sellyak, Bimingham, this year.
The online buyers and a change that you translate into buying small amounts of food daily into small stores involves supermarkets to make people more to persuade them to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chairman of Sainsbury's, affirmed that the establishments will once appear more of commercial centers, since the chains of supermarkets try to compete with shops like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and no food devices.

We also invest in especially formed staff that one can come to ask advice.
Our gamma of products is designed to adjust all of the needs and the attractive, practical locations mean that we're now a cosmetic fate that defys the old purchase habits.

The star of the program Dragons Den, Peter Jones, went off "furious" after the TV announcer Holly Willoughby was stripd out of a business of 11 million pounds with their lifestyle marker to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spen and ITV
Willoughby has no time for his house clothes and Truly accessories.
His company had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneyneth Paltrow.
Thirs Morning's presenter, of 37 years old, has used Instegram to announce his farewell.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons' Den, Peter Jones throwing sparks from his life-style mark in the last minute to focus his new gold contracts with Marks & Spen and ITV.

The business came to compare with Goop, the brand of Gwyneyneth Paltrow, and it was prognostic that it would double down the fortune of Willoughby, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, of 37 years old, resounded the Instagram to announce that he left Truely, Jones took a plane to Britain and directed one of his vacation residences.
A source said, "Truly was different from the priorities of Holly.
It was going to be their long-term future during the next two decades.
Their decision to go outside has left all the people who were participating in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of money in Marlow's offices to sell."
The experts believe that the abandonment of Thiers Morning's presenter is among the most reproditionable stars of Britain could cost him to the company of millions of pounds, due to considerable investment in products that go from coxins and can take them clothes and teaxtile to the home, and that he might still take over his launch.
And I could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are three sons' fathers, and they have a narrowized father to Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years ago.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, of 52 years, he joined himself as president in March.

"I haven't ceased anything."
He pointed that Kim is interested in keeping a second meeting after his initial meeting celebrated in June in Singapore, that Trump considers a great step towards the North Korean disnucle.

More than three peppers after June's summit in Singapore, the main diplomatic of North Korea, Riong Hoo, communicated the world's city leaders in the U.S.N.N.'s General Rememperations, which the North does not see "sponding response" for the United States.
On the contrary, the U.S., continues to understand punishments that continue to exercise pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic sight in his mytin speech.
"The things with North Korea are fine," she said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
They'd have died millions of people.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He said his efforts for improving Kim's relationships had positive outcomes: to end up with missile tests, help free the hostages and make the American soldiers return to the remaining soldiers.
And he defended his inspiring strategy about the relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this aft, we'd have about 200 people down here," said Trumping the crowd he had just faced.

Although in Aceh they built shelters for tsunamis, it's not common to find them on the back.
Although an alert was issued, the absence of a tsunami alert seat in Palu probably contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of the cases, traveling among many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.

Cromwell statue of parliament becomes the last affected by the struggle "write history"

But Cromwell Society has made the suggestion of Mr. Crock's "discover" and "to write history."
John Goldsmith, president of Clemwell Society, affirmed, "It was inevitable in the present debate about the retreat of statues that Oliverwell's figure is located outside the Panace of Westminster if it became objective.
The English civilian wars weren't ordered or performed by Cfromwell.
Perhaps they'd sacrificed Crowell's wrong thing to the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Campwell carried out by William Hamo Thorneycroft is a test of the existing opinion in the 19th century, and part of a figure that many considers it worth homage.
Mr. Goldsmith declared The Sunday Telegraph: "Cemwell is considered by many, perhaps more the end of the 19th century than now, as defensor of the parliament to external pressure, in this case, it was taken from the monarchy.
If that is or not a whole representation of a continuous historic debate.
And what's of course is that the average conflict of the 18th century has defined the next development of our nation, and Crowell is a recognizable figure which represents a single side of the divisory.
Its achievements like Lord Protector too are deserved to celebrate and memorial."

More than 20 million people saw the trial to Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people kept on six television channels the appalling testimonys of the judge named the Subunal Courte Bartrenaugh and the woman who faced a sexual aggression who presumably had place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stagnation continues, and the strings interrupt their usual programming for a new time of Friday: an agreement designed by the sensor by Arizona, Jeff Flake, so the FBI realizing an investigation of one week in the charges.
Ford said to the Senate Judicial Committee that it's 100 percent secure that Kavanaugh held them by drunk and he tried to take his clothes off at a school party.
In an infamated testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was totally sure that it had not happened.
Nielsen reported the Friday more than 20,4 million people would have seen it.
The company told the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CN, Fox News Cinel and MSNBC.
Encrypted encryptions have not been immediately available for other strings that have been broadcasted, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Buins Network.
And Nielsen is usually having trouble measuring the people who watch TV from office.
To get an idea, it's similar audience to a football end or the Ocar's ceremony.
Fox News Chanel, who put support in great measure of Kavanaugh's name, led all strings with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted the whole day, second Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3,26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2,89, and CNN 2.52 million second Nelsen.
After the trial, the interest was persisted.
Flake was the middle figure of Friday on TV.
After the republican office made a statement by indicating that it would vote to favor Kavanaugh, it was captured by cameras from CNN and the CBS on the mortars in the morning being aimed by demonstrations when he attempted to enter a promotion on the World Committee.
He remained with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was reliving, phoned straight at CN.
"I'm here in front of you," said a woman.
"Is he telling the truth to the country?
They told him, "you have power while there are plenty of harmless women."
Flake said his office made a Flake statement before the promotion was shut down, he added he'd have more to say in the committee's audience.
All the television and cable chains would go back straight in hours after the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance to the name of Kavanaugh before the Senate, to meet the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI was investigating alienations against the name of the next week, which had become a democrat minister.
Flake was convinced by the conversations maintained with his friend, the Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Colones and several Senators, Flake took a decision.
The choice of Flake had power, because it was evident that the Republicans would not have the vote to approve Kavangh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an inquiry by the alens against Kavangh.

When the moment's activists in my local party voted to censorve me, the truth is that it didn't surprise me too much.
After all, they're the last of a bunch of laborers who aren't well received, and everything by telling our opinion.
My colleague in the parliament, Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way because he was faced up in decision to antimitism.
In my case, the censoration was criticized because I wasn't according to Jeremy Corbyn.
about the importance of a economic policy responsible, national security and on Europe, which usually matters about which Jeremy dissented with the previous lemonades.
The notification for Nottingham East of the Friday meetings indicate that the meetings are inclusive and productive.
During the most of the eight years I've been deployed workistic, the meetings of the Friday nights of the committee were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, that's no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "Member and gentle policy" has been forgotten a long time ago, if it's ever started.
It's more evident than the worker's party doesn't tolerate different opinions and judging if all the opinions are acceptable for the head of the party.
This began a little after Jeremy became the leader of the Party, when fellows who believed to share a similar political view began to retire and adopted possessions to which he would never agree, be in matter of national security as the single UE market.
When I'm speaking publicly, and actually the same thing as what I say, there's a tremendous bullying and attack on social networks censoring center policy, telling me that he shouldn't be at the Laborist's party.
And it doesn't only happen to me.
In fact, I know that I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are called me to be a political character.
Print me the professionality and determination of the colleagues in front of a sexist, or racists, every day, and they don't stop.
One of the most disappointed aspects of this was of politics... is how they normalised the levels of insult.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Laborist Party had to fight a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with each "untrusted" movement, or every change in the selection rules, the party gets more narrow to you.
For the last few years I got many advice that urged me to keep my heads hidden, not to be so frank and that then "I'd be right to me."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I went to the Laborian Party, there are 32 being still at school, led by the neglect of the Theaiser government who had literally let my classroom down, I've claimed a better public complaints for those who need it, as much as being a local seller or the minister of the Government.
I've never tried my policy, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham Andast may be confused with all political postures, and I don't agree with the current part's direction.
The ones who promoted the motion of Friday, the only thing I'd say is that while the country walks into a Bregit who affects our homes, business and public services, I don't understand that desire to lose time and to question my loyalty to the Party's leader.
But in fact, the only message I've got is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my electors, be members or not the party: I'm proud to serve them and promise that no threat or conventional convenience will act with me to what I think of the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose - an Invicto Ayr gets headed
It is possible that the last two attempts would change a little bit the final result, but no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this amine at the Premier League de Tenent.
Now lead the table and it's the only invisible team of the ten.
At length he was the superiority of his defence, as well as the fact of risk, he took his team to victory, and Peter Murchie's coachie had all the right to be happy.
"Now I've got to test ourselves in our game and we're still invits, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said, "You must admit that Ayr had the chances best than our brother."
Test in the minute 14th of Great Anderson, transformed by Flarzier Climo, laid down the Ayr, but a yellow card for the captain Scotus Rory Hughes, accessed for the party by the Warris, allowed me to speak the numbers and Jaggon Jaggot Gabour a wrong launch.
He increased the advantage for the Ayr with a penalty before, right in the middle of the time, he took a single shot, leaving the 17-5 marker in the Ayr rest.
But Melrose began well at second half and at Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a stop prolonged by the severe injuries who suffered Ruaridh Knott, who abandoned the field in paldiola and from the reset, Ayrvanzed more through a test of Stafd McDonald, transformed by Climo.
The Captain in Ayr function, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose got a player out of having a player more than a test of Bruce Colvine who has not been consumption, at the end of a high period of pressure.
However, the local team came back and when the Hutchinson received the yellow card by boarding Climo when he hadn't had the ball, McPhenson marked a trial from the penalty line at the post of Ayr.
Climo marked, as he did it almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe had collected the launch in the David Arstrong area and sent it to the third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth test of the local team.
The Stil Game Protagonist starts a new race in the Restore Industries
The star of Stil Game, Ford Kieran, seems to be prepared to enter the restore industry after discovering that he was named after a restaurant company.

'The sea is ourstand to Bolivia, waiting for the Pacific to tribute.
sailors watch a thirsty ship deck in La Paz.

Bales from the Titic lake until the Amazon are attached to the slogan: "The sea is our right.
Regain it is duty."
In Bolivia without sea, the memory of a coast lost before Chile in a blood conflict of resources in the 19th century continues to live alive, just like the anhelo de sailing through the Pacific ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their most attached point in decades, as Bolivia expects an international decision of justice on October 1st after five years deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course he expects a positive desenance," maintained Robert Calzadilla, a good diplomatic.
Many of us see the CIX senches in giant screens all over the country in the hope that the court of Hae is proclaimed by the favour of the complaints of Bolivia and that, after decades of intermitant conversations, Chile is obliged to see the negotiated negotiation of Bolivia from a sovereign out of the sea.
Evo Morals, the cardiac president of Bolivia, who's faced with an inexemic battle for the re-election of the next year, has a lot in play on Monday sentences.
"We're very close to the Pacific," promised the end of August.
But some analists might consider it unlikely that the tribunal of the reason to Bolivia, and that he would little change if that was going.
The organism of the United Nations with thirst in the Netherlands has no power to adject Chinat territory, estulating that he will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The fact that CIX sentence comes only six months after the final argumentations we heard that the case "not complicated," claims the expert in international right to Paza Zarate.
And far away from promove to Bolivia, the last four years may have delayed you.
"The theme of access to the sea takes a lot of time locked by the current ballyvia administration," Zarate demonstrations.
The retrology of Morales has given me the good will left to Chile, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have no exchange for embassadors since 1962.
16 , 00:33:33:16 , The Expressande Rodriguered Veltzé, 16 , 00:39:39:16 , representative of Bolivia in Haea, 16 , 00:39:39:16 , rejected the idea that the court had been to make an unusually rapid decision.
Monday, we'll have a great chance to open up a new stage with Chile, and a chance to "to end 139 years of this decorated with mutual benefits.
Cazadilla also denied that Morals, even one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using this subject with political purposes.
"Bolivia will never renounce his right to have access to the Pacific ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to get over the past."
North Korea says that nuclear dissatisfied me will not occur unless you can trust E.S.
The minister of North Korea's foreign matters, Ring, declares that his nation won't come to discourage nuclearly if he can't trust Washington.
Rik talked on Saturday at United Nations General Assembly.
He made a call to the United States so the promises made during a cucumb in Singapore between their leaders.
This comment takes place in a time when the secretary of state E.S. U. U., Mike Pompeo, seems to be on a period of rebooting nuclear diplomacy extends for over three decades after the top with the North Korean leader of Korea, Kim Jong.
Risifying that it is "a utopia" that the continuations and objections of the United States to a statement that puts an end to the Korea's war double to the North.
In Washington, you can accept the memoir without Pyngyang gives her the first step to the mere.

Pompey plans to travel to Pyngyang next month to prepare a second cumody Kim-Trump.
The fashionable parades of Paris reveal the last line of giant hats which will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your hat collection or be covered completely of the sun, don't look any more.
The Valentino and Thom Browne designers revealed on the gateway a series of accessors for their spring-year-20 collection that opened the public with the most pure Weeks of Paris.
The impossible hats have filled this summer and these designers brought the gateway to their most surprising creations.
The main piece of Valentino was a exaggerated hat with an abarching feathers which plundered the head of the models.
Among other large-size accessors there were tangled, a mago hat and even a little girl, but they weren't designed to protect the head of the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time to Hallo between.
Many of the colored masks had the sewed lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high sewing.
One of the creations looked like a full team of divers, with the glasses and the tube, and the other cones of ice cream.
And if it's fan of the enormous fashion, it's lucky.
Fashion understood that giant hatreds could reach the shops.
The demonstrated hats come right after the "Bomba", the hat of palla with a 60 inches which leads all over the world, from Rhhanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The quilto mark which is behind the impossible hat which invades all social networks pulled off the other large creation gateway: a bag of beach nearly as large as the model attacked with a bath suit that carries it.

John Edward: the linguistic skills are essential for citizens of the world.
This continued in 2018 with another harvest of supersalieur results in the exams, which is only enforced by an individual and collective success in sport, art, music, and other community material.
With over 30,000 students in all Scotland, these schools, represented by private schools (SCIS for their schools in English), if they endeavour to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools have a aim to prepare a student for education superior, to the career that chooses, and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and put an education plan into measure, we're seeing modern languages continue to be a popular and popular subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language you understand, that's coming to his head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he'll come to the heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend only on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people in other countries.
From the recent exams of this year, we can see that languages are on the highest board, and with the highest approval rates in private schools.
A 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages took supersalient supersalient.
The data, recompiled from the 74 schools that build the SCIS, show that 72% of the students have received honour in order to send, while a 72% of whom they studied German, a 69 percent of those who studied French and a 63% of the Spanish studied, they also managed supersality.
This demonstrates that private schools support languages and consider key skills that children and young no doubt need in the future.
So, languages are currently taking the same consideration as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs and all sorts.
A survey performed by the commission for the employment and the formation of the U.S. United States in 2014, indicated that between the lack of knowledge of languages constitutes a 17% of the reasons why businessmen are worth covering the cowherd.
Therefore, the linguistic skills are increasingly more unpredictable to prepare the youth for their future career.
These skills are essentially essential in a globalized world, as there are more working possibilities that need languages.
Independently of the chosen career, if they learn a second language they have a real advantage in the future with a skill of life as this.
Being able to communicate directly with people in other countries will place a bilingual person directly into the head of the competition.
According to an enquisa de YouoGov between 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent never talked about any foreign language enough to keep a conversation, and the French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, in this case a 15 percent.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for children of today.
To know several languages, especially the economy in development, provides children the most opportunity to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, English languages differ according to school.
Some schools are focused on the most classic modern languages, while others are noticed by more important languages considered to the U.K. for 2020, like they send or Japanese.
Independently what their children's interests, private schools always have several languages to elector and special teachers in this field.
Private schools are special to provide an learning environment that prepare children and the squirrel with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future is.
We can't deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, which languages remain of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as international communications.
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for youth.
Il faut bien reads it.
John Edwards is head of the board of private schools.

The electoral acts of Trump come to Virginia in the channel of YouTube
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaigns tonight at Wheeling, Virginia West.
You will be the first of the 5 myth programmes of Trump to the next week, including the stops in the cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of refunded for his candidate to cover the republicnant of the Supreme Court, Trump is intended to obtain support for the next half-five elections, since the Republicans will now take the risk of losing control of Congressum when vote in November.
What time is Trump's myth in West Virginia and how can you see it on the Internet?
00 , 00:20:36:00 , The V.R. V. E. Merc., 00 , 00:27:36:00 , is programmed for Saturday 29th, 13 , 00:27:33:00 , in the 7 p.m. ET.
You can see the Trump's mitin in Virginia by following it via the direct stream by YouTube.
Trump will probably treat the matter of the trial celebrated this week to the Supreme Court, Brettren Kavanaugh, who has been accusated by the accusations of sexual inappropriate behavior and that maintains the Senate's vote for a week while the FBI investigation.
But the main aim of this series of mytines is to help the Republicans to encarge the elections of November with a new impulse.
So, these five myths that Trump will give the next week as aim for volunteers and sympathetic sympathizers while the Republicans attempt to protect and expand the majority who have in the Senate and in the Capresentation Camera, according to Reuters.
"The Congress control is as important for his schedule that the President will travel as many states as possible to the season of campaign," said the Reuters a thoroughly vulture that he preferred not to be named.
"Ohio and Pennsylvania of Pittsburg" media, according to West Virgin Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits Western Virgin, the state where he won for over 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is attempting to help the Republican candidate of the Western Virigian Virgynia, on the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the surveys.
"It's not a good symptom of Morrisey that the president should come to support him in the enquisis," declared Simon Haed Simon Hader, policeologist at the University of Virgin Occidential to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is showing water to fight and keep the hope for the individual parts of the Sunday
After three individual sessions, the surf of Saturday afternoon could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
What the escilating impulse is a totally devoted conceptive, but in which the sports believe it really, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
"They have a six-point advantage and now are four, so I suppose we've been taking that as a bit of impulse," said Jordan Spieth while I was marching at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of lead with more sweetest in play.
The Americans, said Spieth, feel they have a bit of wind to favour and a lot by which they were cheering, among other things the technique of Spiherth and Thomas, who played together all day and each account with three points of four.
Spith's resultal from the tee to the green and is predicateing with the example.
These guttural screams were made stronger as they advanced to their round, making a cruzzling pudding at packing the room when he and Thomas were two points beneath two.
When getting the put that made them win the party at 15, he screamed a similar cry, the kind of scream that says the American team is not out yet.
"Just concentrate and worry about your party," said Spierth.
It's the only thing left to these players now.
18 holes to leave a footprint.
The only players with more points than Spierth and Thomas for the last two days are Francois Molinei and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange thing is that European couple has fours of four, and they can't make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a yawn on Saturday afternoon, but they'd also avoid them on Saturday morning morning, Friday afternoon and not last nine holes a day.
That course, and the way it seems to flow its energy towards the crowd and from her, confirming the rivals to beat on Sunday, and there could not be more popular players to achieve a victory when you place the sun on Le National Gulf than Fleetwood or Molineri.
Prefer them both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory is still premature.
bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went off fast to Sergio Garcia, the hero of the folk in the morning, when he started with Alex Noren.
A yawny and two doubles in the first course ended with the Spanish and with the Swedish in a hole from which they have never been near leaving.
But on Sunday there won't be anyone to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and spurmies are so fascinating to see near the interactions between the couples, the councils that give, which are not and the way one can change a strategy at an instant.
Europe played better as a team until now and they have a significant advantage of the last day, but this session of burrows also showed that Team USA has a dealer to fight, which some, particularly Stateside, they hesitated.
Europe has a 10-6 advantage the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy good advantage the last day of Ryder Cup after leaving the burglarys and of the lofts with a 10-6 advantage of America.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinewaques covered a burden on two wins on a Tiger Woods with difficulty to raise four points to the bookmark at Le National Gulf.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who seeks to maintain the trophy that lost two years ago in Hazeltine, gave up a American team that failed in the matutinian leafpaes, put on serial-31.
And, U.U. has offered more resistance in the ferursus, earning four parties, but they couldn't crop the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points of the individual Sunday parties to retain the trophy.
Fleetword is the first new European in earning four points followed while he and Molinri, busted "Molliwood," after a set of sensational week, they are the second couple in earning four points of the four starting parties in Ryder Cup's history.
After I smashed Warods and Patrick Reed in the leaflets, they fitd to the perfection to defeat a screwed Wods and the young American Bryson Deceau with a 54 more categorical defeats.
Woods, who shot two parties on Saturday no pity or glory, showed occasional rashes of brightness, but now lost 19 29 parties in the fashions of lofts and scurgings and five followed.
Justin Rosen, who had rested in the morning leaflets, met with his pair Henrik Stenson in the nightfalls collecting a defeat in Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koreka, numbers and three of the world.
Europe could not always win in a friendly day of brisk in the southwest of Paris.
The three times Jordan Spierth and Juustin Thomas fixed the landing point for the Americans to get two points on Saturday.
16 , 00:46:41:16 , They've achieved a victory 2, 16 , 00:42:41:16 , about Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the burults and they've won Poulter and Rory Microy 00 , 00:443:41:16 , and Ricroy 13 , 00:43:43:40:13 , "Mom 3 , in the burrows 16 , 00:43:43:43:41:16 , after losing the first two holes.
There were only twice in the history of Ryder Cup where a team goes four points on the individual, though as a current headline of the trophy, the Fury team only needs to empathize for conservation.
However, after being the second best in two days, a sensitation on Sunday seems to be beyond its reach.
North Cora doesn't say to me uniliteral if no trust
The minister of North Korea's outside business has reported on Saturday to the United Nations that the continuations increase their defiance in the United States and that the country would not deliver their nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ring Hong Hogon reports the General Assembly that North Korea had adopted "untegant measures" to show its good will" the year, as to stop nuclear and missile tests, to dismantle nuclear trials and compromise at the production of weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see the corresponding answer yet by part of E. U.S.," he added.
There will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances, there will not be unilital to me first on our side.
As I resumed the well-known complaints of Washington to a gradual denuclearization in virtue of the North Korean sand would be rewarded as far as he adopted measures, his statement seemed important, as he didn't refuse to unnecleaning as it happened with Pyagon in the past.
Ripped reference to a statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump in the first cumium between an active American president and a North Korean leader, celebrated at Singouga 12 June, when Kim complied to the "declusion" of the Korean peninsula as a real security guaranteed of the North Korean.
North Korean Korea seeks from mother's time a formal for the 1950-53 Korea war, but United States declared that first Pyngyang should fulfill its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also been resurrected to relax the international sanctions on North Korean area.
"Stands America insists in the first "disnuclear" and increases the pressure with sanctions to get their goal of coerciative, and even though they're obliging to the end of the war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctations can make us kneeling is a impossible dream, for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continuations affirmate our distrust."
Rin didn't mention the plans for the second term between Kim and Trump that the American leader mentioned in the United Nations in the early week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader of Korea, Moon Jee-in in the last five months and added, "If the other part of this question of denuclearization was South Korea and not America, the decline of the Korean peninsula would have not reached a dead point."
Still, the tone of the speech of Risk was radically different from last year, when he told the general Assembly of the United Nations, it was inevitable to attack the United States with the Northern missiles after the "preside malved" were called Kimhomber in a suicide mission.
This year in the U.N., Trump, who last year threatened to "destructively" with the North Korea, entrusted the Kim by his courage by taking measures to disatisfiance, but said there's still much work to do and that the sanctions must be kept until the North Korea desclar.
The Trump Wednesday said that there was no long time for it, and that 'as it's two years old, three or five months old.'
China and Russia argues if the ONU's Security Council should reward Pyngyang for adopted measurements.
However, the young Thursday of the US State Secretary, Mike Pompeo said to the Security Council of the United States which: "Securation of the Security Council must continue firmly and without exception until we discover the total denucle, end and checked."
The Security Council increased by unanimity the sanctions in North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to cut off the backgrounds for nuclear programs and ballistic missiles of Pyonyang.
Pompey met with R to the margin of the ONU's General Assembly and then remarked that he would visit Pyonyang the next month to prepare a second top.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last journey didn't seem well.
Abandoned Pyngyang in July saying that if he had advanced, just a few hours from the North Korea to denounce him "man of mafia."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a machine-making, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the corresponding "meditatives".
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the corresponding "mini" was the security guarantees that Trump promised to Singapore and advance to the normalization of the relationships with Washington.
Harvard students perform a course about how to rest enough
This year, a new course at Harvard's University is making all his students die more at the end of combating the growth of machist culture to study all night emulated by caffeina.
An academic found out that the students in college number one of the world often don't know the basic aspects about how to care for them.
Charles Czeisler, teacher of sleeper's medicine on Harvard's Meditola and specialist Hospital Brigham and the woman's, has contributed the course, which believes is the first of this guy in the United States.
It was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact the lack of sleep was in learning.
"At the end of the course, was a girl coming up and said, 'Why do they only tell me this now, in my last year?'
He said that no one had spoken to him about the importance of sleeping, what was surprised to me," remarked at The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains the basic aspects about how to acquire a good Sound habits with an academic performance and athletic, as well as improves general well.
Paul Barreira, teacher of psychopathy for Harvard and CEO of the University's health services, said that college has decided to present the course after discovering that students had an important lack of sleep during the week.
The course of an hour of duration involves a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there's an image of a dormitory, where students make it click on cups of coffee, curtains, and books to get information about the effects of the chaphine and the light and how the terit defiy of sound affects the athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at the time of lying.
In another section, it is reported to the participants of how the lack of prolonging sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, we drag brains, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons animating the participants to think of their daily routine.
"We know that you will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we think you have the right to know this information, in the same way that we have the right to know what is the effects for health if we have adopted for smoking, added the teacher Czeisler.
The pride culture of spending all night is still there, it asserts, and it adds that modern technology and pressure increasingly for students that involves sleep lacking was a growing problem.
Scared that it makes me enough, and it has a good-quality sleep, it must be the "marm" of a student to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, marking, even to avoid fatty, for it lacks sleep, makes the brain between in unanimation mode, which makes it constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 year-old Caiformian who studied chemistry and biology, helped Professor Clisler to design the course, after having attended one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to impulsate a course in the whole campus.
The next step, wait, it is to apply to all the postgram students that complete a study program similar before joining competitive institution.
The Citizen Czeisler recommended students to consider the option to establish an alarm to fall in, as well as for the time to be desperated. So even, it is recommended that they are aware of the effects of the blueluzon that emit the electronic screens and the lighting of LEDs, which can uncalibrate the circumsian rhythm and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Ringgers: Mengaw down the men of Gerard
The Ranngers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Mengassoled the unarticulated equipment of Steven Gerrard at an defeat by 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox team intended to record its first victory for domicide from the triumph for 4-1 in February on St. Johnstone, but the Gary Holt's team dared the second defeat of Gerard in 18 games like a coacher, who left his team to eight points of Hearts, leaders of Ladbrokes Premiershi, the Ligaskes.
It was about seven minutes before the rest and a line of the Ranngers with little inspiration never gave the feeling it was packing.
While the Rangers went down to the sixth office, the Livingston went up to the third place, and it's only behind the Hibernia with a bit of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the judge of Calum Spence had to have tried by a wound in his head betrayed him from an object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team which dragged the Ayr into the semiphines of Betfred Cup, the League's Copa.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 of the Levingston who pulled out a point to the Hearts last week, and would have been delighted by the way in which his organized set up his opponents at all time.
It's possible that Rangers dominate possession, but Livingston did a lot more when they had the ball.
They could have marked in just two minutes when the short time of Menga sent Scott Pitman to the gate of Allan McGregor, but the camper's center was a great opportunity.
A powerful shot of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halket, but his comrade of the defense, Alan Lithgow, only managed to put him on the second stick.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
No doubt, Alfredo Morelos felt they'd have caught penalty at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawles chuckled, but the arbitre, Steve Thomson, ignored the complaints of the Colombian.
The Ranngers only carried two shots at the door at the first half, but the old guardsman of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had just had trouble with the end of Lassana Coulily and with the Eviyjaria attack.
While the opening of the Levingston in the minute 34 could have gone against the Log of the game, no one could deny that they deserved him for their hard work.
The Ranngers came back in front of Jacobs' strong training.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher kissed Scott Robinson's ball, who kept the cold blood to choose the Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard acted in the rest by changing the Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, change which had almost an immediate effect when the jug made a walk to Morelos, but Kemeterly ran from his line to block it.
But the Livingston followed the visitors to play exactly at the sort of game they like with Lithgow and Halket picking up a long balcony after another.
The H Hotel team could have extended the advantage in the late moment, but McGregorouse was perfectly raised to reject Jacobs before Lithgow was fitted from the corner.
The replacement of Rangers, Glenn Midleton, reclaimed another penalty on the board of Jacobs, but Thomson rear view.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our soul from Sunday Morning: September 30, 19882, 1036 years ago, and CONTATE... was the day when Johannes Wilhelm "Geigers" was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an inventory that finally led it to the device known as Geiger counter.
A stepping of science from then, Geiger's counterman also turned into a fundamental element in the popp culture, like in the film of 1950 "Balls of Coronda" ( Coronda bells, protagoned by those scientists apparently Roys and Dale Elevans:
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as the urium.
By using these headphones, the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactiveity of the minerals can be heard."
"Stays, I'm sure he's spreading now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after her 63 birthday.
But the inventive who wears his name survivor.

The new vaccine for cancer can teach the immologic system to "ver" the defectious cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immunological system to recognize the defectuous cells as part of the treatment
The method implies the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab.
They can "ver" a common protein to various types of cancer and inject it again
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immologic system to recognize the defectuous cells, saw his oral cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method implies the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which change into the lab so that they can "ver" a common protein to various types of cancer called HER2, and then reject the cells.
The professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesada, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "jumpulse the growth of several types of cancer, including breast-corks, lung and colorful teacher explained to Berzofsky.
One approach resembling immune cells from patients and "intense them" to tackle the cancer cells worked in the treatment of a kind of leucemy.
Kanye West shipped in a favour of Trump when using a MAGA hat (Make America Great Again) brings her appearance to the Saturn Night Live (SNL).
And the result was not good
During a program of Saturny Night Live, they apupted Kanny West in the studio after a confused presentation in which he emerged to the President of the United States, Donald Truemp, and said he would be presented as a candidate in 2020.
After interpreting the third night song, named Ghost Towle (Castasma) in which he had been carrying a drop of Make Great Again, raised his democrats and relied his support to Trump.
"Are you often talking to a white man and says, "How do you like Trump if it's a racist?"
If I were worried about the racism, I'd have left the United States a long time ago," she said.
SNL began the program with a star-satimized by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked from the Brenturteaugh's testimodancy to the Senate Judial Committee on sexual demands made by Christine Blay Ford.
Although it has not been issued, Chris Rock went up to the images of the criticism of West to social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock himself from West with this release.
Moreover, West left to the audience that had passed a bad time in the bastiors because of his capturing.
"Put me down on the beaters.
They said, 'Don't go off with that hat.'
I was intimidated!
And then they said I was going to be the cock," he said to me by Washington Browse.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to be going?" saying, "I'd go to "use my hat in superhomous, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do."
Try with love."
His comments provoked apute in the audience at least twice and the members of the SNL elenco seemed to be overgoted, reported to the Variety magazine, with the following witnesses which a person was there for the release: "All the studio was at all silence."
They had named the West as the last substitute for Arian Large, whose old young man, the raper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
He left a lot of people in a interpretation of the I loveit song (Enectam) and dressed me like a bottle of Perrier.
West got the support of the PPUSA group conservative, Candace Turner, who wrote the next tweet: "For one of the brave but brave spirits: GRACE PORT TO THE MAFIA."
Yet the presenter of an interviewing program, Karen Huntar, wrote a tweet saying that West was just "ser who is and that's completely wonderful."
"So and everything, I optioned by NOT rewarding anyone (comparing his music or clothing) that I think you're opening and scattering a ideology which is needed for my community.
It's free.
Just like we do," he added.
Before the spectacle, the foxman announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "thee being officially known as Kanye West."
It's not the first artist who changes his name; follow the steps of Diddy, as well known as Puff Dady, Puffy and Pddy.
The Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion, and of course the last legend of the music, Prince, has changed his name for a symbol and, then, the artist previously known as Prince.

The gas star of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks the toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-handhanded role like Jon Snow in the fantastic role of the HBO Game of Throns.
The actor of 31 years, he attacked the machist hero's stereotype, saying that roles on the screen are translated into that the boys often have to be tough for them to respect them.
By speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something failed" and wondered how to face the masculinity problem was "MyTome."
Kit, who recently married Game's Game's co-protagonist of Throns, Rose Leslie, too of 31 years, admited that he feels strong to approach the problem.
"Possoly I feel pretty strong at this time, in what do we get wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What are we teaching men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit thinks television can be partially responsible for the increase of the Toxic masculinity thanks to its very male characters.
He went on, "What's innat and what teached?
What's taught you on TV and in the streets; what makes the young people feel they need to be a certain part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time, how do we change that?
Because clearly something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admits that he won't make any preculate, nor the gambling of Therons when the series reaches the next summer, asserting that "the cat of horses and battlefields".
From November Kittagonda will prolong a reposition of True West (the real west), Sam Sheppard's history of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Mostly, the actor revealed that his meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Throns.
"I know my wife in this program, so, of course I came up with my family future and my life from here in front," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, on the series of fancy technicians of Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of the family equity of Leslie, in Scotland.
VIH/asida: China reports an increase from 14% in new cases
China announced a rise of 14% in the number of citizens that live with HlV or sidal.
It affects more than 80,000 people in the country.
40,000 new cases were changed only in the second quarter of 2018.
The great majority of new cases have transmitted sexually, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, the VIH was quickly propagated by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who hired HlV in this way had been reduced to zero, claimed the American authorities in a conference at Yunan Province.
However, in internual terms, the number of people who live with HlV or silk in China grew up in 100,000.
VIH's sexual stream is a serious problem in the LGBT Chinese community.
The homosexuality has been discriminated in China in 1997, but they assured that discrimination against the LGBT persons is extended.
Because of the conservative values of the country, the studios estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of the men who have sexual relationships with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the streams of disease come from unfaithful sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the China government has promised universal access to mediaprise for HlV as part of an effort to face the problem.
Maxine Waters deterrecitedly that a member of the staff filtered data from the Republican Party, "speopic states" and "the conspiring concessional troops"
Saturday, the United States representative, Maxine Waters, announced the accusations that a member of his staff had published personal information from the Republican Party in the Wikipedia Legal pages of the legislations.
13 , 00:43:42:00 , Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the declarations were being made by web sites and commentistics of the "sultrain".
"Mies, lies and more infmous lies," remarked Watts in a declaration in Twitter.
Secondly, the difundated information included the particular addresses and the phone numbers of the U. Lindsey Grahams, of the South Caroline, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatcher, both of Utah.
The information appeared in line on Thursday, published by an unknown person in the Capital Hill, the U.S. government hall, during a viewer of the Senate, on a charge of sexual accusations inadequated to the South Supremo's candidate, Brettttvakag.
The filtering appeared a little after the three Senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative Places, like Gatéway Pundit and RedState, have reported that the IP address that identifying the origin of publications was associated with the Water's department and revealed the information of a member of the staff of Waters, Communicating the Capit Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a full lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and brotherhoods, was not responsible in any way of filtering this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie."
The Basters declaration immediately suggested in a online criticism, including the old Secretary of the White House, Ariischer.
"This dismember has become angry," wrote Fleischer.
"You will notice that you have not temperament to be a member of Congress.
When they're accused of something he didn't do, he mustn't get angry.
You mustn't show unsatisfied.
You mustn't question the defendant's reasons.
It must remain horrifying and in serenity."
It looked as if Fleischer was comparing the reaction of Waters with the Democratic chriticism of Juiz Kavanaugh, which the criticus accused seemed too angry during the Thursday audience.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was introduced to dwarves in the middle elections, has also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if it was true" he shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters told me that his department had been caught "the inquiring entities of the law and proper authorities of these faucuent accusations.
"We'll warrant ourselves to discover the culprits," continued, "that's how people are legally responsible for all their actions that are destroyers and dangerous for all and each of the members of my team."
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in action), the spy parody without power from Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to seek the transcendence of the Bregit into new movies from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of this parody and comedy of the action of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and went back to Johnny Ungish Rebourn (Jony English Rengs).
The ironic will become the satire about the matter of the evidently stupid that we are in the new opportunity of the nation's export?
Anyway, the incompetent character of salty-eyed and face of Johnny English renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear idea that it comes from a general comic book creation for non-planet territory.
Naturally, it is Mr. Bean's secret agent who, in spite of his premursion premulator premursion, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of that guy who has contributed with a single note on the fire Carros's opening ceremony of the olympies of London 2012.
Also, it was originally based on the comopolitical and mysterious agent that Atkinson has interpreted upon us once and now forgotten televisive TV commercials of Barcycard, where he lay down the chaos in his passage.
There's a couple of good times at Johnny English's last exit.
I love when Johnny English comes down to a helicopter while using a memorial suit of armor and the pastures make a short crash against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps into the view, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is oddly superfluus, especially when this kind of "serious movies", as 017 and Mion is impossible, it uses the comedy convincingly as one of his ingredients.
It seems as if humor was directed to children, instead of adults, and, in my opinion, the extravagants of Johnny English are not so engenious or concentrated as the film chis change from Antkinson to approach Bean's character.
Now the unpopic argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cybernetic pirnet is in the network of supersecretrous websites of Britain and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to anguish of the agent that is on duty, a small detented part for Kevin Eldon.
It's the collide for a porporate first and conflict, which has already suffered a total crisis of political impopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of you with this character that almost Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
His intelligence aestheirstores inform her that as all the spies at active, you must get somebody out of the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher in some snob institution, but gives foreign classes about how to become an infilent agent; in this part there are some goose, when English offers academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whiteall for an informative emergency session and meet his old fellow Bough, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine capita, an enthusiastic paper where Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of his Majesty's secret mistakes come back to the action, looking at the beautiful femme of Olga Kulenko, Ophelia Bulleva.
Meanwhile, the first ministry is a dangerous succumbor of the charm of the multi-themial multi-tech scholar who claims that he can resolve British computer problems: the sinister Jatroson Volt, interpreted by Jaketic Lakecy.
English and Bough, they start their dydynasis of laughters: disguised ass of barracks, round fire to French restaurants; they create a tumulture that is illegally on the edge of the luxury circumstock; And English provokes total damage when trying to use a virtual cuckus of reality to familiarize the inside of the house.
Evidently, all arrests come out of that last sequence, but in the kind and scaspel way it is, it appears to come out of a childish television program.
The result is quite regular.
And how did it happen to Johnny other Englishish films, couldn't I help to think, the British movie industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Laborist's Party refuses to be drawn a plan so the British work four days a week, but they're paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Laborian Party is considering a radical plan that will work for four days a week, but which cover up for five
As a matter of fact, the party would like businessmen to pass the savings made through the computer's revolution (IA) to the workers of newly-due an extra day.
So the employees would enjoy a three days' weekend, but they would keep getting the same salary.
The sources say that the idea would be "warmed" to the economic agenda of the Party and their plans to tilt the country, in favour of workers.
The Sytote Congress supported the shifts of four days a week, as far as workers take advantage of the change economy.
A major source of the Laborist's Party told The Sunday Times: "It's expected to be announced a check of policies before the end of year.
"It will not happen from day to night, but a four days' working week is a ambition which fits in the approach of the party to balance the economy to work, as well as the general industrial strategy."
The Laborist's Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party has promised a work week of four days during its campaign for the general elections of 2017.
And yet, presently the Laborist Party does not support ambition in its totality.
A Laborist's gatesman said, "A working week of four days doesn't enter the Party's policy and he's not being considered by this."
13 , 00:46:41:00 , The lander in the shadow, 00 , 00:43:41:00 , John McDonll, 00 , 00:43:41:00 , has used the Laborist Party conference last week to reforce its vision of a socialist revolution in economy.
Mr. McDonll said that he was determined to regain the power of anonymous directors and of the "speculators" in public service companies.
The plans of the landing in the shadow also involve the possibility that the current shareholders of the water companies do not recover all their investments, since a workist government may perform "ductions" for irregular irregularity.
He also confirmed the plans to place workers in companies' advice and to create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the actions of private sector to the employees, who embolsancing a value of 500 to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" if the FBI research on Kavanaugh could make them change their minds.
The FBI research on the accusations against Judge Karentrenaugh was delayed a week at least the final vote on his name for the Supremal Court.
On Sunday, on the broadcast of an interview, the reporter of the "60 Mintes" Scott Pelley asked the republicans of John Kennedy and Lindsey Grahams if the FBI might bring them into light that he would have changed his opinion.
Kennedy showed himself more open than his colleague in South Carolin.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
I spoke to Judge Kavangh.
I called you after the accusation and asked him if he had done it.
It was firm, determined, springing."
However, Graham's vow appears to be immovable.
"My opinion about Bretty Kavangh is decided and he'd make an explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brettty denied him roundly," added Graham in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people who mentioned they couldn't verify it.
There was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."

At the end of receiving a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a HlVP ticket), the public assistant had to complete a series of tasks or "acations", as to do a voluntary voluntary, send an email to a world leader, do a phone call or any other means that it is meant to help you create conscience about its goal with the poverty.
But what is the degree of success from Global Citizen at 12 years of reaching his goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuating the people to ask you to adopt measures, or is it just another case of known "clicvism", people who think the difference to sign an online request or sending aweet?
From 2011, Global Citizen says that he recordd more than 19 million "act" of his followers, impulsing a different set of objectives.
It claims that these actions helped stimulate the world leaders to announce commitments and political policies to over 37 billion are established to influence the lives of over 22 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and commercials from their stocks, which at least 10 billion dollars have already been demembred or won.
The group estimated that until now the guaranteed backgrounds had a direct impact on almost 649 million people all over the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power Pointer of Nutriation (The power of nutrient), a investigators and executioners of the U.K. estimated the "help for children to develop its potential," with the promise of providing Ruanda 3.5 million to help with the disnutrival in the country after receiving more than 4700 Citizen.
"The support of the U.K. government, the gifts, the national authorities and the Sympathizers of Globe Citizen as you, we can convert the social injustice of the demonutivity in a note the foot of the story," said the crowd of The Embassy of Nature, Tracellman, during a direct concert in 2018 in London.
The group also said that after the number of over 5,000 actions to the favor of mothers and children's improvement in the U.K., the government announced fund to the The Power of Nutriation project that will come to 5 million women and children with interventions about nutrients.
In answer to one of the frequent questions in your website, "What makes you think we can end the extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said, "It will be a long and difficult way and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, in the same way that has happened with the great anti-paratheid movements and favor of civilian rights that we precede, we can accomplish it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekand, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Jane Monáe is some of the artists who will act in the event of this year in New York, who will be presented by the ower-Lane Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the seammar to perform a "bloke" to make it difficult for the energetic exports of Russia, announced the U.S. Secretarium of the United States.
"In case it is necessary," Washington can resort to the seaside to prevent the Russian energy reaching the markets, including the Middle East, deteriorated the U.S. Intermitory Secretary, Zinke, second cyllited Washington.
Zinke aleged that Russia's compromise in Syria, especially where the legitimate government's instances operate, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with the energy in the same way that they did it in East Europe," he said, as if you report it.
In addition, according to the officer, they have ways and the means to face it.
The United States have the capacity, together with the marine, to make sure the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy won't go to the market, he said.
Zinke directed himself to the participants of the event organized by Consumeer Ensergy Allian, a nonprofit group of luch that was referred to as the "voz of the consumer" in the United States.
He bought the Washington strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, considering that, in practice, he comes from the same thing.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, to take advantage and replace fuels," he remarked, at the same time as Russia has referred to as "the tactical" with a economy dependent on the hydrocarbons.
Declarations were highlighted while Trump's administration was in a mission to prevent exports of their natural gas connected to Europe, in order to replace Russia's most economic option for European consumers.
For such an end, the brothership of Trump's administration, including the President, tried to persuade Germany to retire from the "interested" project of the Oleduto of Nordream 2, who, second, made the Berlin of Moscow."
Moscow recycling repeatedly that the glorum of North Stream 2 to 11 billion dollars, which was established to bend the ability to the known Oleoduto's ability to take 110 billion cubic yards, it is a economic mere.
Kremlin argumented that Washington's accomplice to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of delegational competition.
"I think we share the idea that the energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and the consumers must be able to choose your providers," said the Russian minister of Energy, Aleksandr Newk, after the meeting of the United States, Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The US posture reached the reaction of Germany, who reaffirmed his appointment with the project.
The German organization of the sector, the Federation of Alemas Industries (BDI, by his German siglas), appealed to the United States to get away from the U.S. Policy and the Bilates between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third state interferes in our energy providing," said Dieter Kemp, president of the BDI, after a recent meeting between the German floor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, and Vlami Puntin.

The accusation of Trump that Pecanin was trying to entertain himself in the elections of the United States, has marked what the officials of the United States said in Reuters's offices as a new phase of an growing Washington campaign to inspect China.
Although it's only normal for foreign governments published commercials to promote trade, Pecann and Washington are now trapped in a growing civil war, witnessing the level of airage in their respective imports.
According to the U.S. experts in China and US, the compensory aliens at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to overhibit the exporters of states like Iowa, who support the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador in China and exgobernator of Iowa, one of the top exportrs of agricultural products in China, said that Pechin needed the workers, farmers, and the American businessmen.
In an article of opinion written by Branstad and published in the edition of the Sunday General Register, it is suggested that China "is insentificing this hazy campaign by difluming propagandistic advertisements in the free American press.
" ""The amuse its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the American tradition of freedom of law and press presses to publish a payment announcement in the Demmesister," wrote Branstad."
"In the contrary, in the position of paper sits at the end of this street of Beijing, are few voices available, and you don't see any real reflection of the opinions firing that Chinese may have about the economic trajectory of China, since the media of communication are under the firm in the Chinese Party," adds.

Kavangh's disaster has lost the female republican vote a few days in the election half of a warrant.
Though many of the main Republicans support and defend Brenteaugh, candidate at the Supreme Court, despite the different aggression charges of sexual aggreviate, analists adven from a violent reaction, above all the fetants, in the next half-five elections.
The reactions around these accusations have been numerous and most of the Republicans have been positioned to go on with the vote.
"These things can't be undone," assured Grand Reeher, teacher of political sciences at the Maxwell school of Syracse University of an article published on Sunday at The Hill.
Reefer also asserted that the last time of the Jeff Flake's Senator (R-Arigon) for an FBI inquiry be sufficient to calm down the spirits of angry voters.
Women won't forget what happened yesterday, so they won't forget it in a next future or in November, they reflected Karine Jean-Pierre, the main aessort and spokesman of the progresses MoveOn, in Washington, D.C.
"The Friday in the morning, the optitors, the gripo of "The Lord of Novero" is manifested in the senate hall, while the Republicans, with control of the Judicial Committee, decided to go ahead with the name of Kavangh, despite the testimony of Dr. Blase Foryd, reported Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democratics will overcome any expectation," insurance to the site of states St. Rothenberg, a political analist neuteral.
"It's true it's already high,

This is beyond the committee's voter, the final voter or Kavanaugh will be sat on the bank of the defendants or not. The problem is how the Republicans came from, and how they treated him, and how they signaled it to Guy Cecille, director of Perriities USA, a group that helps the choice of the Democrats in the channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are divided up between people who believe the Ford testimony or Kavangh's testimony, even though they lean on the last one.
A new enquisa de YouGov samples that a 41% of the enquisitions creates entirely or probably the protimue testimony of Ford, in front of a 35 % who supports the testimony of Kavangh.
Besides, a 38 percent believes that the most likely one is that Kavanaugh lie during his testimony, facing a 30 percent who thinks the same thing about Ford.
After the press stop by Flake, the FBI is presenting the charges presented by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accused, We owe Ramirz, informs The Guardian.
Last week, Ford was tested before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath that Kavangh attacked it in state of drunkenness when he was 17 years old.
On the contrary, Ramirez aquake that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her the genitals in an universe party when he was studying in Yale in the 80s.
The creator of the World Web would like to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Leee, the inventor of World Web Wave, cast a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this technology legend, is a Soid based company, the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store your data and people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berns-Leeee landed with which Inrupt is "to master the world."
"We have to do it," he said over startup.
This is an historic time.
The application uses the Solid technology to allow people to create their own "custom data" or POD.
Contact lists can be included, To-dos, calendars, music, and other professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Sotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store to be unique is that the user has a full control over who can access what information.
The company rates this as a "personally-to-worker through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to his president John Bruce, is that the company sports, resources, process and appropriate skills to help the Soruid being available all over the world.
The company is now made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company of IBM, some developers hired to work in the project and a volunteer programmer community.
From this week, developers all over the world could create their own decentralised applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berns-Leeeed that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook nor Google with whether to enter or not a complete change that his business templates of one day would change for another.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on the Saturday in Medium, Berns-Lee wrote that the "Inrupt Commission is provides commercial energy and a ecosystem that helps protecting integrity and quality of a new web based on Sorupt."
In 1994, Beerners-Lee turned the Internet when establishing the World Web community Consortium in the Technology of Masachusets.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee stood up in an imposing voice in the debate about the network's neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Leee remains the founder and director of the World Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Date Institutes.
"I'm really optimistic about this new era," added Berners-Lee.

Pepa Piglets the MMA sharps at the best time
Imagine you're taking all night awake to enjoy the full spectacle of Bellor 206, and when you get to the best part of something preventing you.
The Saint Jose Cartel included 13 battles, being six main ones, and he was just re-transmitting live at Chanel 5 Realm.
But the six of the morning, just when Gengar saved Mousasi and Rory MacDonald would see the faces, the U.K. viewers were perplexed when they showed Pepag.
Some people didn't get impressed after there's been so many hours awake waiting to see the struggle.
An affliction described the change to these infant drawings in Twitter as a bad joke.
"The state government refuses that this content was not suitable for 6 in the morning, and therefore it had to be changed to child programming," explained Dave Schwartz, vicesidentrorn of Marking and Communication of Bellator, when asked for the stream.
"Peep Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, chairman of Bellator, said they should take care of the U.K. viewers in future programming people.
"I think we can solve it when we think about the repetition," he said Coker.
"But if it's the six o'clock there, we can't solve it until Sunday, it'll be Monday for them anymore.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change was retaliated, there were many messages to be received and not all they were nice.
We were trying to figure it out because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to get to five struggles, in six, we wanted to take the top to our sharps, but we're pasting and,
It gives us a lot of rage."
Deset Island Discs: Tom Daley felt low because of his sexuality.
Tom Daley, Olympic jumper, claims that he grew down on the bottom of the world because of his sexuality, but this has done his motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims it didn't notice that not everyone was like him until he got to high school.
Invited the first broadcast of the Deset Island Discovers Radio 4 leadership by Lauren Lauverne, explained that he started talking about the rights of homosexual rights to give other people hope.
He also shared that the fact of being father helped relate to the importance of winning Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program is low for disease.
As a guest of the first program led by Laverne, Dadeley shared that he felt "infirm" to the rest of the people because "not socially accepted that the children and the girls love you".
So even it said that, "State the day of today, that feeling of lowerity and being different is what took me by and gave me the necessary strength to get the success."
I wanted to prove that it was "someone" so people had not been disappointed in finding their sexuality.
With two Olympic Olympic medals of bronze, it became an actor of LGBT and used its appearance in the Commonwealth games of Australia to ask for more countries than to depend on homosexuality.
He decided to talk because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear the repercussions, and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three times the world's champion said that he fell in love with American Dustin Lance Blanck, who met in 2013, "was all a surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live so hard in such a few days" (such as only 14 years) he'd set off for the first time in some Olympical games and his father died of getting after three years), he's hard to find someone of your age that had experienced similar albaths.
The couple had his first son in June,Roobert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley to fully change his perspective.
If you asked me last year, my greatest motivation would win a gold medal.
"But now I know that there are much more important things than a golden Olympic medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 for 40 years because of a brain disease.
The Daley's father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son were some tickets for London 2012, he wanted to be in the first row.
"I wasn't able to tell you that I wouldn't be here to take that first row," he shared Daley.
"He was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and was at that precise moment, at the moment of his death, when I realized that he really was not invisible" adds.
The next year, Daley competited in the 2012 Olympicos games and won a medal of bronze.
At that point I knew that this was my life's dream, skipping a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling confirmed.
The choice of the Heather Small song is not in vain, since it's the melody he took her in his preparation for the Olympicides, and he still puts his boots on.

An Mickelson down in a way ended on the bank of Ryder Cup this Saturday
Phil Mickelson will strike a scholar on Sunday when he plays his 47, the game of Ryder Cup, but he must improve his technique so that this had not become a unhappy event.
Mickelson, who participates in the bienal event by 12, had stood on the bank by the decision of Captain Jim Furyk and couldn't part in the folk-horses of the Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as many other times for America, five times amployment has spent the day aminating and working to improve its movements.
Although it was never the most precise of the players, not even at the moment of his career, for 48 years, it doesn't fit in the length of Le Gulf Gulf field, where the high grass usually punishs the wrong shots.
And if that wasn't enough, Mickelson faced at nine o'clock on Sunday party when Francis Moriline, winner of British Open, who joined Tommy Flewood to win the four parties of this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of the individual parties, begin with good foot, the performance of Mickelson could be totally crucibial.
Furyk was confusing in his husband, although he couldn't say much more.
"He said to the perfection the role he was throwing today, gave me a palmed on my shoulder, had passed my arm and told me that he'd be ready," shared Furyk.
"I was constantly in itself.
It has a spot on the Hall of Fame and was very fond of teams in the past and this week.
I probably hadn't thought I had played two parties.
I thought I would play more, but at the end they're the things, and so we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, she wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will over the Frost Nick's record at the largest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
He could mark his career at Ryder Cup, race that he never reached the level of his individual palmade.
Mickelson counts with 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk claims that his presence is also maintainable to the team.
"It's a funny, sarcostic person, with engaging him and likes to shove with people, it's a good guy to have at the team," explained.
"I like to see how well these players have been spent most young players with him this week.
It's much more than a good player."
Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fear me for the loss of the advantage.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knowing for experience that an considerable advantage in the last journey of Ryder Cup can be converted easily on a nuisance.
The Great Dénés discovered in 1997 in a party in Valderama, where a team struck by Seve Ballesteros had a advantage of five points on the United States, but they ended up at the purpose line with a minimum gaining 141⁄2-31.
"You're thinking we had a great advantage in Valderama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderama, we've won a little," reflected Bjorn, in the photo, after seeing the promotion of 2018 earning the Friday and yesterday, 10-6 in the Gulf Gulf.
The story proves that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we must go all over.
We must get out and do the right thing.
This is not finished until the points are in the bookmark.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I won't get tired of saying it, I'm concentrated on our 12 players who are on our side, but they're also very aware of what you're on the other side: the best players in the world."
Charming with the performance of your players in a hard golf field, Bronn added, "I'd never sing victory before long.
Tomorrow we're facing another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of the individual performance, and there we also have to demonstrate our value.
It's great to be with a partner next time when things are going well, but when you face things individually, then try the maximum you like golfist.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, who pluck the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
The difference of Bjorn, Jim Furyk will fetch his players to have a better individual performance than with their fellows, the exception of Jordan Spierath and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
His own Furyk was in both ends of these last day's turns, being part of the winning team in Brookline, but ending as a waste of miracles in Menah.
"I remember every one of the damn words," he answered when he asked him if he remembered how Ben Crennshaw, the Captain in 1999, had gathered the players last day.
"We have 12 important parties, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brookline or the Meditah.
When you see the impulse goes in one direction, there's a lot of pressure in those middle parties.
We've prepared our alignment on considering this and put on the players as it seemed to us, we want to make magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and to Rory McIroy at the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, the upper half of the classification.
"I have decided this order because I think it covers the whole way," explained Bjorn about his selection for individuals.
The new ship of Germany polluted once more.
The most young Farmada's fleet should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old ships at the time of the War War Era, but it won't arrive until the next year because of the defectal systems and at the cost each larger, they have reported the local media.
The postcard on the "Rhinland-Pphalz" service, the leader of the Benden-Wuetemberg class flamberg, has added to the first semestre of 2019, according to a military spokeh to the Dieit newspaper.
The ship should have been embedded in the Marine in 2014, but later problems delivered the fate of this ambitious project.
The four ships of class Baden-Württemberg, who the Armadad said in 2007, replaced the ancient Bremen's old fleets of class.
It is understood that they will count with a powerful cannon, with different antiebetic missiles and antibuques, as well as hiding technology, as a reduced reduced, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include larger maintenance periods, it should be possible to unfold newer to two years out of source ports.
However, as well points Diee Zeit, these continual delays means that the ships of war with the last technology, and allow Germany to project their power in the foreigner, will be outraged when they enter in service.
The unfortunate fraganta F125 was news last year, when Armia Almother had officially refused to cossmise the ship and returned to the barn Blohm & Vos in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Marine was devouring a ship to a builder after the delivery.
Shortly if he knew of the reasons behind this devolution, but the German communications were talking about crucial defects in software and on the hardware, which imposed the use of the ship in a combat mission.
The defects of software were particularly important, since the Baden-Werttemberg class's ships will be operated by a 120 sailors crew; it is to say, half of the staff need in the old Bremen's old fleets of class.
Besides, the ship was discovered that the ship had a excess of dramatic weight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of Marine so that they could add them in the future.
They think the Rhinland-Pphalz of 7,000 tons weigh twice what kind ships used in the Second World War.
In addition to the hardware, the total price of the project, which includes the formation of the crew, if it's also becoming a problem.
It's assumed that there's already awesome amount of 3100 million euros, in front of 2200 million initials.
Trouble with the most of the new flagases concern the light of recent warnings that German power is doing waters.
In the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German parliament committee has recognized that Marine is being left with no quarter ships to deploy.
The officer claims that this problem is increasingly bigger, since old ships were withdrawed, but you do not replaced with others.
Likewise, she was sorry that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class flag can join Marine.
National Truest spies the secret life of the bats
A new investigation which is taking place at an end of the Highlands of Scotland is trying to reveal as the bats are using the landscape to seek food.
The results will be expected to light over the behavior of these single flying mammals and help keep the future activities of conservation.
This study led by scientists of the National National for Scotland, will follow Pipitrellus pygrus and Pipirellus ppitrellus, as well as the morce Myotti and Plecos aurstitute in the Inverweers in West Ross.
Special burning teams will be placed in key locations around the property to keep track of the bats activity during the season.
The staff and NHS volunteers will also perform many manual detectors.
An audio analysis performed by experts for all recordings will determine how often the calls of bats and what you are doing.
Then a map of habitat will be drawn to create a detailed picture of the landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, the aessor of Conservation of NES nature, considers that the results showing areas of the habitat are more important for the mortars and how they use it each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habat management work, such as the creation of meadows and what is the best way to keep the woods for the mortars and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and in the entire U.K., have considerably decreased in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction work and development that affect nines and loss of habitat.
The axerators and the harnessing also drives an risk, as well as the traps with sticking for flies, some chemical treatments of construction materials, and the attacks of domestic cats.
The bats aren't blind,
But because of his night-to-whalf habits, his ears are more useful than their eyes to hunt.
They use a sophisticated technique of eclocation to locate insects and obstacles in their path of flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the height of over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens, and 76,000 hectarates of land into the entire country, is very serious indeed taken to the bats.
Count with 10 formed experts, which do inquiry periodically, nesting inspections and occasionally rescue.
The organization even counts with the only one and the first reserve of discount in Threave Escove at Dumfries and Galloway, who is the home of eight of ten species of Scotland.
David Thompson, station manager, claims that this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Threauve we have a great area for bats," he claims.
"We count with old buildings, historic trees and a good habitat.
But it's a lot of things that we don't know about the mortars, so the work we've been doing here and other properties will help us to understand better what they need to prosper."
This is the importance of controlling the dueness of bats before making maintenance tasks in the properties, as it is possible that involuntary destruction of one single child of maternity could kill at 400 females and believes, which could exterminate all a local population.
The bats are a protected species and it's illegal to kill them, or trouble them, as well as destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer Scots from the Bat Conservation True, animating people to help:
"It's still a lot to learn about the bats and, in the case of many species, we don't know how it's going to its populations."
Ronaldo disintelligated by rape demands and their lawyers are prepared to demand German posting
Cristian Ronaldo is indicted by complaints of rape in his against a false one, claiming that the only people want to be able to meet using their name.
His lawyers will demand German magazine by publishing these charges.
The front of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping Kathn Mayorga, an American woman, in a hotel in Las Vegas; 2009.
It was asked that the fugitive paid the woman 375,000 USD to say nothing about the incident, posted Delpiel the Friday.
Times after his release, Ronaldo, 33 years old, this false news on a live video from his Instagram account, which counts 142 million followed.
"No, not and a thousand times not.
What she said today is false, she said to the chamber five times the golden ball winner.
People want to know each other using my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous with just saying my name is part of my work.
I'm a happy and respectable man," added the smiling player.
The Ronaldo lawyers are prepared to demand Depiel by the charges, which cover up as "in the unacceptable statement of suspicions in the area of privacy" according to the Reuter.
Christian Schertz's lawyer said that the player would ask an indemnization for "indefinite amount of infection", which is probably one of the severest infections of the last few years' personal rights personal rights."
Of course, I'd have occurred in June 2019, in a Southern Palm Hotel and Cassino de Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronald and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where presumably Violou, according to documents presented in the Court of the County County County County of Nevada.
Mayorga asserts that Ronaldo, after that incident, he kneeled down to say he was a 99 % a gentleman, but that %1 had betrayed him.
The documents make sure Ronaldo confirmed that they both maintained sexy relations with both sides.
Mayorg also suspects that he went to the police... and he told the photographs of the wounds, but later he agreed to an extraxudical agreement... because he was terrified by the reprisals and was concerned about the public ecarnium.
The 34 years old woman says he's looking for the agreement while he continues to get traumatized by the incident.
At the time of all crime, Ronaldo was about to gather with the King Madrid from Manchester United States, and this summer it occurred to the giant Juuve in a agreement of 100 million euros.
Bregit: The automobile producers would abandoned U.K.
The United Kingdom would always regret the loss of his posture as a world self-mobile manufighter around Bregit, according to the secretary of Greg Clark business.
He added that it's worrying that Toyota UK had asserted the BBC that if Britain left the United States without an agreement, he'd determined to temporarily avoid the production of his Burnston factory, near Derby.
"You must get to an agreement," added Clark.
The Japanese automobiles maker said that, in case the Bregit had not come to any agree, the impact of the delays on the border might cost some labor.
00 , 01:07:03:00 , The Bursnaston plant, 00 , 01:09:05:00 , manufacturing in the Auris and Toyota model Avens, 13 , 01:03:00 , produced last year a year 00 , 01:08:00 , about 1,000 vehicles, 00 , 01:03:00 , one 90 , from which was exported to the rest of the United States.
"In my opinion, if Britain abandons UE to the end of March, we will witness the production as it stops in our factory" declared Marvin Cooke director, General Toyota in Burnaston.
Other automobile manufacturers in the U.K., they also expressed their fear to the abandonment of the UE, without coming to a agreement about trade between the borders, between them Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land.
For example, BMW confirmed that he would close his Mini plant at Oxford a month after Bregit.
One of the main concerns of automobile manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in case of not getting to a deal at the Bregit.
The Toyota production line is very tight, each 37 minutes are coming in parts of the U.K. and the UE for automobiles made the measure.
If March 29, United Kingdom left UE without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and might be generated by a short time and shortage of parts.
The company asserts that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal rhythm more than one day on Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark claims that the Chequers of Thesa May for future relations with the U and is "callibred to prevent control in the border."
It's indispensable to have an agreement, and we want it to be best agree, to enjoy the current success, but also take this opportunity into the whole BBC Radio 4 program.
The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains.
Toyotta could not estimate how long the production would be determined, but was warned that the long-term costs would reduce the competition for the plant and may even cost of work.
Peter Tsouviaris, employed by Burnston for 24 years, and the union coordinator of the Unitedite, said that their limbs are increasingly preoccupied, "In experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman spoke that they presented a necessary plan and crib to the future relation between U.K. and U.S.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could restrain himself again
The White House said that the high risk meeting of Donald Trump and the subsecrate of Rosenstein could delay a week longer because of the candidate by the Supremertren Kavangh.
Rosenstein supervised the work of Mr. Robert Mueller's special lawyer, who's investigating the Russian interference in elections, the links between Russia and Trump's helpers, and possible obstrition to justice on the President.
It's not as much as Trump to the general fiscal, as if he doesn't, what was in danger of Mueller's independence, he fed the rumours in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke to use a microphone to film conversations with Trump and the possibility to replace the President with 25th.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, including reports that they said he was about to resign.
In return, a meeting with Trump was announced, who was found in New York, on Thursday.
Trump confirmed that he would rather not have to leave Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a shock with the judicial committee of the Senate in which Kavangh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused of sexual behavior does not appropriate.
On Friday, Trump ordered an inquiry of a week to the FBI about the denunciations against Kavanaugh, which had yet delayed the vote on the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, the Secret press secretary of Trump, appeared in Fox New Sunday.
As for the question of the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered, "There is still a fixed date; it may be this week or a week after, since all that is happening in the supreme court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press is informed."
Some journalists questioned that statement, since Sanders took from the 10th of September without celebrating a press conference.
When Chris Wallace announces the motive asks him,
Sanders said that the lack of informative sessions would not have been given to an amusement of the reporters, although he added that he will not be able to deny that attitude.
He also suggested that the direct contact between Truemp and the press will increase.
The President grants more interviews than the previous president said, although he did not notice any source that had evaluated these data.
They'll keep on informative meetings, affirmed Sanders, but it insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly the president of the United States, that's much better to address you questions to her.
You're witnesses of how we've been doing this for the last few weeks, and that's a press conference where you can directly talk to the President of the United States.
Trump usually responds to questions when he leaves the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with diagnants visitors.
However, the solitaire press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the President has proved the cause of this week in New York, with a free appearance and rather strange appearances to the journalists gathered.

Impovered the foreign purchasers will be applied to a property in the U.K.
The foreign buyer will be paid a higher shock when you buy a property in the U.K. This additional money will be used to help people homeless people who have the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of the Corbyn campaign to lure young voters
The increase of the tax of the bell will apply to those people who don't pay taxes on the U.K.
The testoulder hopes to win over 120 million pounds a year to help people without a home
The foreign buyers will be paid a higher number of bells when they buy a property in the U.K. Oras May will announce that this extra money will be used to help people without a home.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of the Jeremy Corbyn campaign to attract young voters with most accessible promises and to focus on the high-recessive people.
The increase of the taxboard will apply the people and companies not paying tax in the UK, and the money raised will serve for supporting the Government campaign to reduce the number of people who sleep in the street.
Recargo, which is added to the current end of the bell, including higher levels entered two years ago for the second living rooms and purchases to rent, can be of up to 3%.
Do they expect the change to achieve 120 million pounds a year.
As for the 13 percent of the new buildings were performed in London... in London, they are bought in the U.K., which is causing a raise of the prices... and it becomes difficult for the first time... living... had more difficult... to access the immobile market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "mats ghosts" because of the high number of foreign buyers who pass most of their time out of the country.
This new policy applies to fair weeks after Boris Johnson was asked for a clip on the Eiga-mission clipping application to help young people to acquire their first house.
He has hit the great builders to keep the prices of the living, elevated by the purchase of soil and the not-use of this, and urged Mrs May to remove the percentage of fictions in the moderate price houses to fix the " shame of the living sector" that is lived in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of reform proposals involving the household, including control of the renters and the banishment on which the lodger doesn't have the guilt.
He also wants to detour the city halls that are greater than you can to build new housing.
Mrs May declared, "The last year I said I would devote my warrant to restore the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, it's necessary to fix the dissolved market.
Great Britain will always be open when you want to live, work and start a life here.
However, it's not fair to resulgage for those people who don't live in the U.K., as well as for business with base in the foreigner, they're living in for British workers' residents.
For too many people, the dream of being owners of a living place is too far away, and the indignantity which means that it doesn't distinguish from a roof being too real real real.
Jack Ross, "My last ambition is to train Scotland."
The Sunderland manager, Jack Ross, declared that his "Tulthma ambition" consists of becoming the selected Scotch of Scotland at some time.
This four2-year-old Scotch is enjoying the challenge of the northwestern club, which presently takes up the third square in the Leagane, three points away from his head.

I played once in the selection B, and that was all, she declared Ross to the Sports application of the BBC Scotia.
"I came to see you playing Scotland in Hampden often with my father when I was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that chance will only come if I'm successful by directing a club."
Between the Ross' ancestors in charge of the Sunderland train involves Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gusyet and Paul Die Canium.
The previous manager of the Athletic claims that he did not feel inquietent any of these figures going so consolidated in a club as great after rejecting the Barnsley and the Ipswich.
"The success for me will it be at this moment if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and the installations of the club are inducably own from a Premier Leaga club," he said.
"It's not going to be a simple task to get there, but it's likely that you just consider it to succeed here if I can return the club to the Premier."
Ross only took three years like a trainer after a period of assistant at the Dumbarton and a 15 month period within Hearts' technician.
At that period he helped the Alloa to recover from the promotion to the third division, and he succeeded in that St. Miren would happen to be about to descend the title of the Championship the next season.
Ross asserts to feel more comfortable now than was never found during his player at Clyde, at Hartlepool, at the Falkirk, in Stern and the Hamilton Reachical.
"I would hardly find myself in a real crossing," he remembered, taking over the Allore's office.
"I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It's funny because it wasn't bad, I've won my life reasonablely and enjoyed some success.
But game might be tough.
There's a lot of things you must get over every week.
I'm continuing them in the relationship with stress and labor pressure, but I like training.
I always like to train and now that I am doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."

A announcement of a maternal milk statement where women with cows divided to public opinion on networks
A mallernal milk statement company divided the public opinion on networks with an ad, compared to the languishing mothers with cows that are moaning.
To announce the launch of the proclaimed malital milk statement that is silent by the world, Evie's company published an iron announcement on a musical video to demonstrate freedom that offers the new milk statement to mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of ugly cows at the rhythm of a song like the following: "Yes, I move myself, but I have no tail" and "If you have not noticed, they're not just usable, they're my breast."
The color goes on, "Max, mux, I'm feeding babies, mux, I'm muttering my friends."
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the Facebook page of the company, provoced poem on the nets.
With 77,000 playbacks and hundreds of comments, the video produced different reactions between the viewers. Many of them claimed that this posifies the meddle of the woct sector.
"Use cows to announce this product was a very discreet decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to be able to give them milk, but in their case we stole their children after giving birth, he wrote one.
The Evie milk Statement can be placed discreetly within a matternal holder (Evie/nai)
Another spectator remarked the following: "Clarly traumatic for mother and baby.
But, yes, why not used to announce a milk statement for mothers that remain with their babies?
Another viewer added the following, "What ad is so little tact."
Other viewers defended the advertisement, even an affirmed woman who seemed to be "commonious."
"I feel like it's a great idea.
If I were still giving the chest, I'd buy one.
Get out my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit shot, but I interpreted it as a joke.
Methinks a great product," he wrote one.
Another remarked, "This is an amusing commercial address directed to mothers who extract their milk (as often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like "wals".
This is not an ad to compliment nor judge the tears industry.
At the end of the video, this group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet statements inserted in their holdings.
The concept where the campaign is based on is that many women who extract their milk make up feel like cows.
However, the Evie milk statement is completely silent, you have no casables and tubes and you can fit in a mallent contender, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even get out there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, society and director of Mother remarked the following: "The Elvie statement is such a revolutionary product which deserves a provocative launch and provoking.
By describing the existing pipelining between women and milking cows, we wanted to put the focus on the extraction of milk and all challenges that involves how we could entertain and near the incredible sense of freedom that will offer the new statement.

Hundreds of emigrants have been standing silently up to a camp at the Texas border
The number of young immigrants increased although the monthly crosses of the border remained relatively invariable, partly due to the rivalry of retrology and political politics introduced by the Trump's administration vicinity to the children.
Traditionally, most of the little birds were also immigrants without roles and had fear to put their ability to remain in the country by giving one step forward to claim a child.
This has increased in June, when the Federal authorities announced that possible birds and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that these data would share with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high charge of the Inmigration Service and Control Addus of the United States, tested to the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who asked for smaller children without company.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of arresters had no criminal record.
"I'm from 80 percent of the people who are peddrian or part of the homes of these are in the country illegally, and a large part of these are foreigners who committed crimes.
So we'll continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children with more rapid speed, the officials entered new rules that would demand that any of these comparity in the judge before a month was pulled out from their arrest in place 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to the workers of the shelter.
Many will comprecency through video from a person's place to try to legalize their case in front of a judge of immigration.
Those who don't fulfill requirements to receive attendance, will quickly be deported.
The longer they stay in custody, the more likely that they will become anxious or if they deprive, which may lead to violent arrests or attempts to run away according to the workers of shelter and system reports published for the last few months.
The lawyers claimed that these fears increase in greater dimensions than Tornillo's centres, in which there are more possibilities than a child's symptoms are having a bad pass of dispercited due to its size.
They also added to scroll the children into the camping zone without giving them enough time to prepare them from the emotional point of view or to say goodbye from their friends could suppose a trauma that many continues to suffer.
Syria asks the American occupation forces, France and Turkey immediately retired
The minister of foreigners Walid al-Moualem, headed at the Osblem General of the UN, also asked the refugees to return home, though the war in the country is currently found in his eighth year.
Moualem, who also attends the charge of Vice Prize Minister, declared that foreign forces were found in illegally soorium, with the pretext of fighting terrorism, and who would care about them in the way he heard it.
"They must immediately retire and without conditions," communicated to the assemble.

United States counts about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mostly for training and resounding the kurdian forces and the Arab syrians who are opposed to President Bashar al-Asad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in this country devastated by the war.
On the theme of refugees, Moualm has declared the right conditions for his return and blamed the "some West" countries of the irration of irrational fears which provoked that the refugees did not return.
"We went to the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier," he said.
They're polyzing what should be a mere, humanitarian affair.
United States and the European Union warned that they won't offer you any help to reconstruction for Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put the war at last.
ONU diplomatics suggest that the recent agreement reached between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last great rebel bastion of Idlibied to continue with political conversations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented an assault on the vast scale by a part of syrian troops supported by Russia in the Province, where three million people live.
However, Molitant, told me that the agreement had "slow limits" and expressed his hope that military actions have targeted as the agihadists, including the soldiers of the Al-Nausserated front to Al-Qaeda, which "will be erased."
The sent by the U.N. Staffan de dither has the hope to summon the meetings of a new committee made by members of the government and the opposition to build an eborate a post-war constitution for Syria and to make the celebration of elections.
He explained the conditions to ensure the participation of the syrian government in the committee, affirming that the work of organism should restricted "revising the articles of the present constitution" and went on against possible interference.
# Why, Trump will win a second command #
Following this logic, Mr. Trump would get reelection in 2020 to be not that, as many liberals will be waiting, the impeachment and the scandals put an end to their presidency in a way.
In which he certainly would be the most dramatic end of a presidential presidency.
At the moment, there are no signs of exhaustion between the observers.
Since the year 2014, the audience indexs in first-third have been more than two, until they reach the 1.05 million viewers in CNNN and almost tripped to reach the 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average medium of 2.4 million viewers in advance-time, an increasement of 1.7 million viewers approximately four years ago second Nelsen, and the program "The Madwow Show" from MSNBC led the heated the heating indexs of channels with 3.5 million viewers during the nights that occurred important news.
It's like a fire that attracts people from the people because it's treated something that we don't understand, he said Neal Baer, shower of the drama for A.C.signed Suvor, who's dealing with a secret secretary of the minister that becomes president after a Capitor attack.
Nell Scovell, a vet-writer of comedy and author of the "Justs" the Funny Parts: Aand to Few Truths Abot Snaaching the Hollywood Boys "Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi drive in Boston before 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
It's entertainment inside chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the tramas that come up from Washington can determine the future of the case Roe against Wade, if the emigrant families can be rejoined and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can be allowed.

It is not surprised that the 17th Congressional district of Pensilvania is being received a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a congression with two representatives in functions in race to occupy the same position.
This district sits in the outskirts of Pitsburg who have been recently reorganized is represented by the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who managed to get his position in a special election which was last spring.
Lamb is presented against another representative in functions, the Republican Keith Rothfus, which presently represents the old 12th district of Pensilvania, which is superimposed upon the new 1 7th District.
Maps have been reorganized after the court of the South Pensilvania was determined in January that the Republicans had manipulated the electoral circulation of the former districts to their favour.
The electoral race at the new 17th Congressional district has unlike a campaign-finished festival between the principal financial arms of the party, the Campia Demporate Congress (DCC) and the Golden Republican Committee (NCCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after an enthrolled victory in the special elections of March to the congressional 1 8th Pennsylvania, who enjoyed an amplementation.
This post has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the district by 20 points.
Politic experts grant the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States have valued the possibility to penalize the Salvador for his support to China, and then they were thrown behind
The diplomatics warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Pequin, with little reply to the part of Washington.
Mr. Trump kept a pleasant meeting with the chairman of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and even possessed a hotel in Pana Panama until his partners turned out to the God's dirivative team.
State Department servants decided to sort back the heads of the American diplomatic missions of the Salvator, the Dominica and Panathal Republic of recent decisions that didn't recognize Taiwan, according to Hether Nauert, the spoke of the department in a statement made this same month.
However, only if baralled the possibility to apply sanctions against the Salvatorer, who received about 140 million American help dollars for 2017, included to control the archotraphic, development and economic help.
The sanitations, among those who have been included in financial help and restrictions on the vistations, would have been very negative for the American center country and their high rates of use and murders.
As they advance the inner meetings, the American officials and American officials positioned the celebration of a high-level conference, and in the economic prosperity to perform a similar meeting last year, which had regarded a step ahead in the efforts to avoid immigration of people towards the United States.
But the average of September, important officials from the administration left very clear that the conference was moving forward, taking effectively on any possibility of sanctions to the Salvador app.
It is scheduled that the vice president Mike Pence was directing the conference, now programmed to medians of October, in a symptom of the importance which has dared the administration, claimed the diplomatics.
The three West Americans returned discreetly to the Salvatore, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a new message or hard punishment from Washington.
A white door of Mr. Bolton's White House has decided to remark the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomatic diplomatics, who accepted about the internal deliberations all the time and when the nymity of participants was maintained.

Student history
The next negative case could be the report of the special Assessor Robert Mueller on the case of the justice of Mr. Trump, of which there are now abundant evidence in the public file.
Secondly, Mr. Mueller is directing his investigation also to find out if Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in his attack to our elections.
If Congress changes his hands, Mr. Trump should provide accounts in that organism, just when it has to prepare for elections, and may finally have to confront a popular jury.
I am many innognits and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just like his European homologists.
We all need to make decisions both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the battle.
In 1938, German officers decided to strike a stroke of state against Hitler if the Western Resistance and support the Czechs in Munic.
We failed, and we lost the chance of avoiding the slaughter years that occurred later.
The course of history turns around those inflexion points, and the unexporable advance of democracy will be lighted or behind it.
The Americans are inflexion at several times.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump deployspire the attorney general Adject of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's research?
Rosenstein took the water to the neck, since this newspaper reported that last year, suggested to record secretly to the president and speculated that he was inctoped for the charge.
Mr. Rosenstein declared that the information of The Times is not true.
"How are we going to answer if the investigation has just been asked about the F.B.I. about Bretttre Kavanaugh isn't complete or is it unpopular, or is it confirmed by his name for the Supreme Court despite the accusable accusations of sexual abuse and witnessed?
And, above all, will we vote in the elections of half legislature by a Congress that despiration to Mr. Trump?
If we don't pass those tests, democracy will be submissed to a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.

The Rangers' player Graham Dorrans is optimistic how to meet the Vienna
The Rangers receives the Rapid Vienna on Thursdays knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the astonishing set up in Spain to Villarreal this month, would put them in a very favourable position to rank in the Ground of Europe Leaggue.
An injuries on the kneeling prevented the Graham Dorrans' center to bend this season until the Mark 2-2th board at Villarreal, but believe that the Rings can use that result as a trampol to get more important things.
It was a good point for us, since Villarreal is a good team, it declared the 31 year-old player.
"We have entered the party believing that we can get something positive and we have reached a point.
We had a chance to win at the end, but in general, the whole thing is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but the second one was higher.
Next Thursday is going to be another big European night.
We hoped we can reach all three points, but it's going to be hard, because they get a good result in their last party, but with support of our public, I'm sure we can fight to get a positive result.
Last year was hard about everything that happened to my injuries and the produced changes on the team, but there is an excellent environment at this time.
The team is good, kids are having a good time and training are good.
We hope we can fight, forget the season last and succeed."

Federal Fiscals seek to apply a few times applied to death for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
The Federal Federals in New York are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullav, the suspect of New York's terrifying death of eight people, a pity that didn't apply in the state since year 1953.
Saipov, of 30 years ago, used a renter truck from Man Depot to carry a attack on a birci of the Aid West Side Highway by Lohr Manttan, following the life of the pawns and cyclists who found on his way to October.
To justify death's penalty, the phiscals have to show that Saipov killed "intention" the eight victims and that they provocated serious injuries "internitively" according to the notification of death requests presented in the South York Distrito.
Both crimes include the possibility to apply death penalty according to the judge's document.
Weeks after the attack was produced, a federal jurymen introduced to Saipov an imputation of 22 crimes, between those who included eight crimes of collaboration with a group of organized crime, practically used by the faithal cases of organized crime, and a crime of violence and destruction of engines.
The attack renewed a "antable and pressing," declared the Fiscals to describe the way Saipov was carrying the "stroz, cruel and deprivated" as well.
Sayfuelo Habillaviec Sariviec Sariv provosions, masters and houses to families and friends of Diego Norgelini, Ncholas Cleves Cleves, Ann-Laure Decad, Darrenke, Eriel Fernherchiernher Feru, Hernher Fernius, and Alen DénDian Dairnkeo Paug, as it is intended to be an accusation notification.
Five of the victims, they were tourists.
There's a decade that South New York Distrito doesn't parse a case of death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug dealers, but finally the perpetual chain was sentenced to September 2009.
The last time he applied to death in a federal case of New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after conspiring to eat the Soviet Union for the War two years before.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed lack of regrets for the days and months after the attack to court documents.
He told the investigators he felt well for what he'd done, as the police said.
Saipov declared the authorities to perform the accused, inspired by the videos of the ISIS which has been visualized on his telephone according to the accusation.
He also requested to see the flag of the ISIS in his hospital room, he said the policeman.
The charge of 22 crimes has been declared not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal trade lawyers in order to represent Saipov, had indicated that they were "abvia disappointed" with the decision of the accusation.
"We think the decision to ask for death instead of accepting a statement of guilt with perpetual chain without chance of revoiling just proclaiming the trauma by these events for all people involved," remarked Patton.
Saipov's defence team had asked the fiscals not to ask for death penalty.

Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working on others to avoid doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are placing cards on a gales bridge with inspiration and phone numbers you can call to ask for help.
Tyler, Mrs Davis' son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer depression, and killed himself in the 18th.
"I don't want any father to feel like I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs Davis, of 45 years, who lives in Lydney, remarked that his son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said their smile struck any room."
No obstant, he left his job before dying and was "there of a deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at this time, was what his brother found after his suicide.
Mrs Davis remarked, "I have a continual worry that a collapsed effect happens."
Mrs Davis created the cards "to inform the people that there are people who can attend and to talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent, you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, who's been friend of Mrs Davies for years, lost the Mark, his couple for 15 years, a little after his mother's death.
"You told me you were sad or depressed or anything like that," remarked.
"A couple days before Christmas, we have detected a change in his attitude.
Christmas day played deep (when children opened their gifts, he made no visual contact with them or nothing)
He said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it, "Dear the family.
I meant them.
But we have to go ahead and fight."
If it's hard for you to go ahead, you can call Samaritan grams through the number 1163 (in the U.K. and Ireland) send an email to the jo@samians address.org or visit the Samaritan web site here.
The future of Bretta Kovanaugh pende of a thread while the FBI starts inquiry
"I thought, if we could get something that was asking you for a limited and limited time," we could perhaps get a little unity, and he remarked Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that the committee to be "stroduced," because it was paralysing the playrs.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his sympathizers republicnatives that the FBI have been making the investigation?
His reticence is due to a matter of term.
There are five weeks left for the elections of half legislature (the 6th of November). If, as expected, the Republicans will get bad results, they will be severely weakly debilized in their attempts to get the man who wishes for the maximum court of the country.
George W.Bush was calling Senators, exercing pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Buh, thanks to which, met his Ashley wife, who was the secret secretary of Mr. Buh.
What will happen when the FBI take your report?
There's a vote in the Senate which now takes 51 Republicans and 49 democrats.
It's not clear yet if Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, break the pawn and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in Northern Korea under the Kim's post office
The number of North Korea's deserters with fate of South Korea has been reduced from the Kim Jong access to power seven years ago, according to a Southern Korean legis.
Park Byong-seug, quoting the ministry of South Korea, affirmed to produce 1,127 desertations last year, far from 2.706 years of 2011.
Mr. Park confirmed that the endupture of the controls frontures between North and China area and the increase of the charges by the people's charged people on the other side of the border were key factors.
Pyontoyang did not have any public remarks.
In the greatest of the North deserters, they would finally give them the proddeniancy of South Korea.
It declared that more than 30,000 North Korea have crossed the border from the end of the Korean war in the year 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the greatest 13th of frontier with North Korea, and it's easier to cross that the strongly demilitarised zone between the two Koreas.
China consider deserters as illegal emigrastors instead of refugees, and often the recaptritorians compulsoryly.
The relationships between the north and the South (which are technically going on in war) have improved remarkably during the last few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries have met in Pyngyang to keep conversations focused in negotiations about nuclear weapons eliminated.
This occurred after the historic meeting of June between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-a celebrated in Singapore, in which they agreed to work in order to remove nuclear weapons in Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the minister of outer affairs in North Korea, Rion-ho, covered the sanctions imposing by the United States of the lack of advances since then.
"If we have no confidence in the United States, we cannot trust our national security and, in these circumstances, there is no possibility that we dislike so much first," declared Mr. Rising on a banished speech to the United States of New York Nations.
Nance Pelosi calls Bretty Kavangh "histéni" and claims that it's not suitable to access the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority at Camera, Nancy Pelesi, called the candidate for the Supretenter Kavanaughsty, and ensured that it was not suitable for its nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi had these comments in a interview done on a Saturday on Texas Tribune Festival of Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help to think that if a woman behaves ever like that, he'd call her hysterical hysterical," he declared Pelosi about his reaction in front of the Kavanault memorial Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally the accusations of sexual abuse over Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh showed himself very emotionally, sometimes shouting and speaking as he described his family and his school years.
He also sentenced the Democrats of the committee as a charge against him as a "assign of the Greek and coordinate" organized by liberation by the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the presidential elections of the 2016th elections.
Pelosi had declared that the Kovanaugh's memoir showed that he couldn't access the Supreme Court because he showed that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these declarations and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was objected when they asked him to refuse to stop Kavangh if it's confirmed at the post and if the Democrats get most at the Representant Camera.
"What I have to say is the following: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not suitable to be alone in the Supremo Court, but in the court currently found," said Peles.
Kavanaugh is now the judge of the court of the D.C appealing circuit.
Pesolosi added that, as a Democrat, was concerned by the possible resolutions that Kavangh has been able to adopt the protection law for patient and care of the accessible and whose case Regiverade, since the judge is considered a conservative.
In the confirmation views, Kavanaugh was required questions about the certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical person to be prejudiced upon the court and still waiting for us to say, look what right!" said Pelosi.
And women need to do that.
You're talking about a dictatorship justified, months and years of warfare, and you can't express it without crying.
"Let's face when we're angry," I've been confronted for Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so strange, do I?
He continued to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was run into some place, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but that he developed a technique that consisted in that, when he was angry and started crying, said to the person who was speaking, "The best you're thinking I'm sad that I am crying.
But I'm angry."
And then it continued.
It seemed bright."
tears are permitted as a escape valve for the rage partly because they don't understand.
One of my most sharp memories at one of my first job in a dominated office by men, in which I began to cry with an impossible rage of describing, was that a woman most grabbed me from the back of the neck, a distant superior which had always caused me a slight fear, and drove me to the gap of the stairwell.
"Don't let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you.
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a degressor of Coloracrat, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidedural candidates.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was taken into an adventure outside the marriage in a boat named Monkey Burenches and was withdrawed from the presidency career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider the idea of showing herself to the president.
"It wasn't a very reflexed decision," I was confronted between laughs for 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone denointed it "Brancaneves and the seven dwarves."
Because the campaign was advanced, brought in delay to the reaching of funds, so he swore he would not enter the race for the president unless he got himself won over 2 million dollars.
It was a battle lost.
He discovered that some of the men who supported her $1,000 to the mascus candidates would only bring her $250 in.
"What do you think, I have discount?" she asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (and gratitude to people who support it, of frustration with the system which has defected the regaining money and addressing the voters instead of the delegates and defected by the sexism) which became unwordstended.
"You'd think she had suffered a nervous breakdown," remembered Mrs Schroeder about how she reacted the press with her.
"You'd think Kenx was my sponsoring company.
I remember to think, what will they write in my stone?
"Did he do?"
So it can be positive for the commercial war between America and China for Beijing.
The initial bombings of the marketing between United States and China have been encompassors and, in spite of that the war is far away from finishing, a distance between countries can be beneficial for long-terms, claim the experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, shot the first warning at the beginning of this year by recording Chinese key exports, including sun panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant scales this week were produced in the news application that affects a equivalent of 20,000 dollars, carved half the articles that come to the United States from China.
The youngest is rising the rate of five to ten percent in 60,000 dollars in American products.
China has promised to imitate American measures and seems unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will immute into short term.
In order to get Washington if you get back, you would have to give up to your demands, but doubled with the United States would get much more shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts claim that if Beijing knows how to play their letters correctly, the pressures of the commercial war with the United States might favor China along time by reducing the interdependence of the two economys.
"The fact that a rapid policy in Washington or Beijing could create the necessary conditions to initiate a economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than it has been recognized before," said Abigail Grace, an investigator centred in Asia of the New Security, an study center.
Siria is "list" for refugees to react to, claim the minister of outer affairs.
Syrian claims he's ready for the volunteer return of refugees and he's requesting help to reconstruct the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech before the Asemblea General of United Nations, the minister of the outer affairs Walid al-Mouralem has declared that country conditions are improved.
"Today the situation in the ground is much more stable and secure because of the accused progresss of terrorism," he said.
The government remains rehabilitating the areas destroyed by terrorists to resurrect normality.
Now, if you give all the necessary conditions to the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to leave because of terrorism and economic measures that affect their daily lives and their successions.
The UNU calculates more than 5.5 million syrians flee from the beginning of the war in the year 2011.
Other million people go on living in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would thank the help he could receive to reconstruct a country that is devastated.
But he resaled that he would not accept conditional help or countries that were supported by lifting him.
Europe gets victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the American team for an endmark of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Gulf Le Gulf Worklf stands in the outskirts of Paris, France.

Europe recovered the crown when the captain of Thomas Bjorn has hit the 14,5 points which needed to beat the United States.
The American star McLishon, who was the most battle offered during the tournament, sent the water in the 16th-depending hole in the 16th Crow of two, losing his game against Francesco-Maline.
The Italian golf driver shone across all its series, making one of the only four players that got a 5-0-0, since the current tourney format was prevented in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5?" for the player with the worst classification of the European team, Thorbjorn Oleen, of Denmark.
The first class housed in the ranking of the world, Dustin Johnson lost 21 against English Ian Poulter, which is possible that he played his last Ryder Cup.
A veternian with eight Ryder Cups disputed, Spanish Sergio Garcia's player became the most European player of the tournament, with 255 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that I could get the drink back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm glad you could have helped, you've declared an emotional Garcia after European victory.
It happened to have been testimony to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat the American legend of Tiger Wods by 21 on the Sunday Party.
It's amazing how proud I feel today that I might have defeated Tiger Wods, believed seeing this boy playing, declared Rahm, of 23 years.
Wods lost their four parties in France and now he has a 13-23 record at Ryder Cup.
It's about a strange statistics for one of the best players in all the time, 14 majors winners, located so alone behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had problems during the whole weekend not to leave Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played a high golf during the tournament.
The captain of the United States, Jim Furryk, declared after the frustrating performance of his team, "I am proud of these boys, fought.
This morning for a moment they put difficulty on Europeans.
We fought.
I take your hat to Thomas.
It's an excellent captain.
Your 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the US PGA and our Committee of Ryder Cup and go on.
I want these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to get your hat out.
They were superior."
