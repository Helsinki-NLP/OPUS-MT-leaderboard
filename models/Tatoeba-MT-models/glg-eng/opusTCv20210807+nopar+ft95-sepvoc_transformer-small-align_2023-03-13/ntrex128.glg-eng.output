The members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned about "to take them for monicreques"
A dismay among some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM, by the suggestion that they should change the name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate arose by plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole landscape fear being the object of ridicule.
A Labour Party member said his group was concerned that the new name "burns with Twp and Pwp".
For those who do not know Welsh, "twp" means "parvo" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the group's set "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group maintained a "mindly open" regarding the name change, but noted that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to Yorkshire's English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly shall depend on the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act granted the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation made on these proposals that showed much support for the name of Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the issue of the title of AM, the commission preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but MWP's option received a majority of support in a public consultation.
It seems that AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to achieve consensus could result in headache for president, Elin Jones, which is expected to deliver the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The Reform Act shall include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules of disqualification of AM and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what they should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians join the polls in referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday if the name of their country changed the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to resolve a dispute that has already lasted decades with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim from its territory and repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership requests.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who does not oppose the change of name, said he would listen to the vote.
However, referendum defenders, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer the price you have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent as the churches of Harlem continue to fight
“The elders I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“Today, neither one thing nor the other.”
He said he could understand that the bars disappeared.
“People are now socializing in other ways,” he said.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to.”
As for churches, he fears that the money of selling assets does not last as long as leaders expect, and "before or later they will return where they started".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners full of the type of people who would not help neighborhoods remain shrines.
“The vast majority of the people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore they will accelerate the closure of all these churches, because the new owners are unlikely to become members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A black congregation was built with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125 street stores, a Harlem shopping street that was reluctant to hire and ascend black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but like Father Johnson's parishes made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Reversing David Johnson, son of father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly baptized the carillon as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it otherwise: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Professor Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that he was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it to the largest carillon of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin for the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some taken by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the body that governs the parish and which is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing him his concern that the latter "pretents to regain the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some people complained about the lack of transparency by the diocese.
A shark hurts a boy while fishing lobsters in California
Police reported that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while practicing underwater fishing in search of langostas in California on the first day of the season of that crustacean season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel was born to KSWB-TV in San Diego who had been diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help to scream, when he was born with a group of people to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first I thought it was just excitement for fishing a langosta, but that he soon realized he was screaming "I was getting involved!
They brought me!”
He had the scratched slave." Hammel said he realized when he came to the boy.
"I drank to everyone who had come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is admitted to critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that they had seen a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they determined it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
The officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablanca, to Swami's, in Eccinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK’s beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrog and Demanhams with beauty corridors similar to those of large warehouses full of expert assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the UK beauty market, which amounts to €2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashion sales and home products fall, the largest corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and then they will pass to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty occurs at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the shelves that in their day occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty products to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with exclusive areas similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are suitable for vegans, something increasingly demanded by the younger clientele.
In addition, the perfume store, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores implies that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive president of Sainsbury's, said establishments will increasingly resemble shopping centers, as supermarket chains attempt to compete with discounts stores such as Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced sales points from Argos and Inhabitat into hundreds of stores, as he bought both chains two years ago.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but association came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute pharmacy revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business consisting of 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for ?25 million three years ago.
Lloyds were commented to participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: “We translate the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel that you can go to ask for advice.
Our product range is designed to adjust to all attractive and practical needs and locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old buying habits.
Peter Jones "Furious" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from $11 million
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "furiosous" after television presenter Holly Willoughby had retired from a $11 million business with her lifestyle brand to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for his home clothing brand and Truly accessories.
His company had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwynedd Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones throwing sparks by retiring from his lifestyle mark in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was "furiosous" when the television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new businesses, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant he no longer had time to dedicate him to the home clothing brand and accessories of both, Truly.
The business even compared to Goop, Gwynedd Paltrow's brand, and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, traveled to Instagram to announce that Truly left, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed to one of his holiday residences.
One source said, "Truly was by different one of Holly's priorities.
It will be your long-term future over the next two decades.
His decision to leave left all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of goods in the Marlowe offices ready to sell.”
Experts believe that the abandonment of This Morning presenter is among Britain’s most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, due to considerable investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and textiles to home, and that it could further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
The couples were on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a host in the ITV I'm a Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night that “We shouldn’t comment on their business issues.”
A difficult conversation “and then we fall in love.”
He combined with the criticisms he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "little a president's own" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he was putting his voice as a “tale presenter.”
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations for denuclearization have stagnated.
More than three pesetas after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that the North does not see the "corresponding response" by the United States to the first measures to disarm North Korea.
On the contrary, he said, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump has adopted a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
“Things with North Korea are fine,” he said.
“We’re going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship.”
He claimed that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: to end missile tests, help free the hostages and bring home to the remaining American soldiers.
He defended his unusual strategy when talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheater, we would have about 200 people here,” Trump told the crowd he had right ahead.
A earthquake and tsunami devastate an island in Indonesian leaving hundreds of deaths
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not seek international help, so it is a challenge,” Mrs. Summbung said.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to their help.
Given the earthquakes that constantly endure Indonesia, the country is exceedingly poorly prepared to face the anger of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not common to find them on other backs.
Although an alert had been issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, traveling between many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been highlighted in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake goes to Palu, but will take at least three days the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around the improvement of Indonesia's deteriorated infrastructure, and claimed money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko’s administration is affected by a large lack of funds on the final straight to next year’s re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continued sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the confrontation on the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, which use machetes, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the goal of the draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before throwing a shot to the second stick.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced towards the upper left corner of the network.
The ball eventually fell on a Arrizabalaga Kep that jumped into the air and entering the net.
“I just tried to get to that position, organizing us, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as long as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I came to Kante and say a touch without thinking too much and just shot.”
Chelsea won 1-0 in the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues front passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning near half-change and running into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a wall in the center of the field.
He made a beautiful pass in depth leading to Hazard towards the area.
Hazard overtook the defense and ended up in the second stick marking with a fire with the left that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool faces Naples at the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at St. Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of fatalities in Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in the earthquake and the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832, according to Sunday morning the national disaster management agency.
Many people would be trapped among the debris of the buildings that came down with the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters, according to a press conference the spokesman of the Sutope Purwo Nugroho agency.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from the destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman had died.
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in the morning with white gun wounds on John Street, and stopped a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
Police asked people to see or hear something from that step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in his early stage, but I would like to make a call to contact us anyone who had been near John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera of the cockpit that contact us, as they could have key information for our research.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belongs to a Birkenhead neighbor and found himself inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believed they met the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she met that morning.
The investigation continues as the police say they are in the process of informing the victim’s closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police informed him that they do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The man was left speechless when he discovered what happened.
Residents have just learned that they will not be able to enter again within a few hours.
A police officer heard a man telling a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
A woman is crying on stage.
He said, “It’s horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cord with another van just out.
Several officers remain inside the cord watching the apartment block.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to ?MerPolCC, to call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously in the phone number 0800 555 111 citing the September 247 registration.
Cromwell's statue of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to "rewriting history"
Its ban would be poetic justice for its Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by its fanatical and Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion to "disparate" and "to try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the withdrawal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure located outside Westminster Palace became the target.
The iconoclasty of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe they would have sacrificed Cromwell wrong for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent representation by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a test of the opinion existing in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to still deserve tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith declared The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not that is a complete representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the mid-17th century conflict defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a side of the divider.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A pig kills a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and murdered a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
Last Sunday, South China Morning Post reported that man, identified solely by the nickname, "Yuan," was found dead with a dried and blood-covered artery near a cut in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines to pigs in a court on 30 and May 2005 in Xining, in Qinghai Province, China.
He had apparently traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave another adjacent cut.
He said there was a large male with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, nearly 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he was killed.
"My cousin had his legs bloody and crushed," said the cousin, nicknamed "Wu", to Guiyang Evening News.
The safety camera recording shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. from Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market director told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent anyone else from attacking, while police gathered evidence on stage.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although not very common, cases of pigs have already been recorded that attack humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kilos cornered a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and spread to the animal.
After a Oregon farmer had been devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "disparador.
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... they don’t intend to do harm.
You just have to have the necessary respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa will bring strong and generalized rains to the southwest of the United States.
The forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as cold waters fly over the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry torrential rains north of Mexico and southwest of the United States for the next few days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, the east hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a fence begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward, towards the East Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as tropical storm, it will begin pushing tropical humidity northward, which will penetrate the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the fence will create abundant and generalized rains in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and the possibility of land detachments in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will rise to 50 or 75 l/m2 in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain are expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with conditions in deterioration due to the dispersed character of tropical rain.
We strongly challenge to venture into the desert under tropical rain threat.
Heavy rains could form cannons that could become floating rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally full winds and dust.
The fence will bring locally strong rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total rainfall could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause flow of smaller debris and roads.
These would be the first rains in the region’s wet season.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the last hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spreads at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature oscillations in the United States due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this involves significant temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm October start is expected, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which make up about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average to the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and chains interrupt their usual programming for a last-minute news on Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona senator Jeff Flake, for the FBI to conduct a week investigation into office.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that he is one hundred percent sure that Kavanaugh played them as drunk and tried to take off his clothes at a party at high school.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that this had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company told the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other strings that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen often has trouble measuring people who watch TV from offices.
To get an idea, it’s a similar audience to a football final or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all chains with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2,94, MSNBC 2,89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican office made a statement indicating that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being pushed by protesters when trying to enter an elevator on the way to the court committee.
He looked down for several minutes while he was reprimanded, broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m here in front of you,” a woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?
They said, “You have power while there are many defenseless women.”
Flake said his office made a Flake statement, before the elevator was closed, added that he would have more to say in the committee's audience.
All television and cable channels broadcast live hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate to submit the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee the following week, which set up a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced of the conversations held with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of “playing politics” with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticizes her plans to abandon the European Union to “joy politics” with Britain’s future and harm national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May reached the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with his on the cover of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on attacking May’s so-called Women’s Plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should raise tariffs on the other side was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims killed: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspected of LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in shooting that ended Wayde Sims' life, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player (LSU State University).
According to Baton Rouge's police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second degree murder office.
The officers broadcast the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered stage glasses and claimed that they contained Simpson DNA, according to CBS's affiliated channel, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said she admitted to being the author of the shot that killed Wayde.
The defense reported that it was imposed on a bond of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish forensic Office issued a preliminary report on Friday that indicates that the cause of death is a bullet wound on the head that reached the neck.
The department praised Louisiana's state police fugitive unit, the state police's criminal work, Southern University police officer is to the neighbors for their help to get the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Aleva thanked the local order forces for his "diligence and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 shipyard grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was "armed" and "commoted" for Wayde's death.
“That’s what worries us all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ash on Mexico City
The ashes that throw the Pocacathepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano on Saturday after activity was detected in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was overseeing several stronts and tremors.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicals have detected an increase in volcano activity located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 had shaken central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Facing the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independent protesters faced riot police and while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of proseparatists masked contained by the riot police led them eggs and dust paint that created dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also reds later that same day with the police, who used the pigs to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independent groups who claimed "Ni forgetting or forgiveness", faced union protesters who shouted "Larga life to Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received in the protest, according to the local press.
Tension continues the skin flower in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters chose independence overwhelmingly, although participation was low and the opposites of secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at the electoral tables throughout the region in violent confrontations.
The pro-independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also occurred but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence demonstration with his wife, said he had no hope in the possibility that Catalonia would achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when I could vote, but now we're tired of it," he said.
Despite achieving a tight, but decisive victory in the regional elections of last December, this year the pro-independent Catalan parties fought to maintain the impulse, with many of their best-known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained in awaiting trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police's demonstration with his mobile phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pretrial detention since last year, announced that the following year would be held in elections to the European Parliament.
“Presenting myself as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government,” he said.

Three 33, 34 and 39-year-old men were arrested after a car was arrested on several occasions against a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 (summer night in Britain).

It is also possible that a must be shot against the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to rise a level placing themselves after the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team is still unhunting out of the house this year in the Premiership and next Sunday face the leader, Hearts, from which eight points separate them.
But before the Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to invest in the division by sixth consecutive game; head coach Holt has not yet known the defeat since replacing Kenny Miler the past me.
Livingston lets opportunities escape against weakened visitors
Holt's team had to get ahead long before they scored, as with their control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way but his crossfire did not cross the threshold of the goal; then Alan Lithgow's shot came out pushed by Craig Halkett's head from the other side of the goal.
The host team was formed by letting the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger visitors in the games the standing ball.
That’s how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers granted a free shot and Livingston took a draw in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix the Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time the Rangers dominated possession but had encountered an impenetrable defense that avoided him much work from guarding Liam Kelly.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Rangers' guardet, Allan McGregor stopped with his feet a shot by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball out in another game Livingston's standing ball.
Many cross passes were proposed in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two requests for penalties were rejected: one by hand and one by a Halket entry to replacement Glenn Middleton.
"Fenomenal" by Livingston: Analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
“And unanimous, they were excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their ascending trajectory.
His style of play and players have only changed since he returned to the top category, but part of Holt merit is Holt for the way he has driven the team since its arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, proudly led a perfectly organized defense while Menga did not even give them a break throughout the game to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerrard's order, this time they did not reach that level.
They failed the last pass. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. A whole call for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to fix the relationship between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and access from Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city brings together the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters approached to see its president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
The protest duel reflect the division before a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies when colliding with a car
A cyclist died in a collision in which a car was wrapped in London.
The accident took place near the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 hours (summer night in Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died at the spot.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist died in an escape crash on Childers Street just over a kilometer and a half miles from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family members.
There are street closures and buses were diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers are injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in high security prison, according to prison officer.
The riot began in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 p.m. (summer time in Britain) on Sunday and continues.
A unit "Tornado" of specialized officers came to take care of the riots, in which eight prisoners are involved that are contained in a pavilion.
The officers received attention from mild injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesman said: "The prison staff was deployed especially trained to face a continued incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that the officials will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between grids.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was known that the director of the prison center had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officers had to go to jail to calm a revolt in which the staff was assaulted with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (the places affected by drought could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it is very likely to occur earlier next week, when Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy is attracted to the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued sudden flooding alerts for Monday and Tuesday Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service indicated in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones had maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 320-kilometre radius since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread over a 64-kilometre radius from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Meteorological Service provide 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150l/m2 in Arizona's Bordo Mogollón.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Great Basin could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with possible totals being isolated from 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, Rosa's rain could be a blessing, as the region is greatly affected by droughts.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second largest category,” he said.com.
Hurricane Rosa will play land on the Lower California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which will still have a hurricane force on Sunday morning, with wind of a maximum of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heads north to 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason, it is expected to touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force on the afternoon or on Monday night.
It could rain very intensely in some parts of Mexico, a major flood risk.
“The total rainfall is expected from 75 to 150 l/m2 from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and it is possible to meet up to 250 l/m2,” he said.com.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border at the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then will continue to climb through Arizona and enter southern Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
“The main danger of Rosa or what remains of it is the heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. Southwest Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause sudden water trunks and debris flows in deserts, and land detachments on mountainous terrains.
Agression in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder to find a 16-year-old boy with white gun injuries.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 04:00 (summer night in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remained "established".
According to Somerset police, three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area respectively.
The officers asked for the help of anyone who had a recording on the mobile of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘surfuried the mesquinity and cholera’ of the Democratic Party
“To fight for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the mesquinity and cholera" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where she criticized and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago, being teenagers.
Ford also testified in the trial on his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that day the "Americans" witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliantness, quality and courage.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with an imposing public service history,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while talking about the importance of Republican results in the mid-term elections.
“It’s been five weeks away from the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t compete, but I really do it,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that Democrats’ mission is to “oppose and hinder.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place before Friday, according to CNN a Republican Party assistant.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami causes hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke on the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves up to six meters broke on land to the luscofusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the threat arose, people were still on their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were deceased,” said Sutope Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB in a round of prey in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, he dragged cars, trunks, house, dragged everything he found,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had walked high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs spread by the national agency for disaster management showed many destroyed shops and buildings, twisted and knocked down bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) declared that the energy released by Friday's enormous earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, settled at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have magnificent the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugro described the damage as "quantious" and said thousands of homes, shopping centers and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the debris of the destroyed buildings, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that victims and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala and that it is closer to the epicenter of earthquake.
Communications were "totally paralyzed and there is no information" by Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency was harshly criticized on Saturday for not having reported the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a shared amateur recording on social networks, you can listen to a man who finds himself on the last floor of a building screaming frenetically warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people who were on the street.
In a few minutes, the water crashed into the edge carrying buildings and cars ahead.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major shutdown that caused the court of communications throughout Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Authorities claim that the army has already begun sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The airport opened again but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit Palu’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The balance of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
On the way to World Vision staff to get to the city of Palu, where employees are guarded in canvas shelters raised in the courtyard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, commented Mr. Doseba.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's terrible.
Even when groups began the unpleasant task of underway assistance in case of catastrophe, some complained that they were preventing them from traveling to Palu to foreign humanitarian assistance workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and equipment of personnel from abroad can only flow if the place of calamity is declared a national catastrophic zone.
And that hasn’t happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the level of a province,” said Aulia Arriani, a voice from the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, “This is a national disaster,” we can open up to international aid, but that moment has not yet come.”
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, family and friends of the missing men referred to the hope that their loved ones were one of the miracles that lights the depressing argument of natural disasters.
Saturday they took a child out of a sink.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been under her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian national team paragliding, had trained two of the parapentists missing for the Asian Games, who concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Hotel were his students.
“As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the dissemination of the news of the collapse of the Roa hotel among the parapentant community, he had desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, only one gray mark was shown in the messages rather than two blue marks.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he added.
They stole $26,750 while reloading a cashier on Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who recharged a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
In the press release, researcher officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptyed a cashier in the leisure complex and prepared to deliver more money.
While busy, another man "he ran from behind Brink employee" and stole a bag of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the stage, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.

Kanye West changes the name to Ye's
The rapper Kanye West changes the name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "To be known as Kanye West".
West, 41 years ago, is known as Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change occurred before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where they are expected to release their new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled his attendance for "extremotive reasons", according to the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” West said that same year while talking about his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
“So I’m you, it’s us, it’s us.
I went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye alone, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, evil, confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is another of the famous rappers who changed the name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he prefers to call him Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also settled by putting and removing the script and using capital letters.
AMLO undertakes not to use military personnel against civilians
Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, pledged not to re-use military force against civilians when the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students is approaching.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco square that "I would never use the military again to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were rooted throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support Mexican youth giving monthly aid to children studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drags boys to criminal gangs.
The US should double investment in I.A.
According to AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, run by Google, Microsoft and Apple, USA, should double the amount that reverses in AI in view of China’s growing activity in the field.
The comments occurred after several parts of the U.S. government made ads about AI, even if the US lacks a formal strategy on AI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be number 1 in AI innovation in 2030.
“To explain the budget in AI research would be a good start, since the other countries are far further behind than the US, and we are looking for the next big advance in AI,” Lee said.
Duplicate funding could double the chances that the next AI achievement was made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is general director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent Chinese AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat American Othello player with the highest score and later executive at Microsoft Research from Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology competitions as the robotic challenge of the Advanced Defense Research Projects Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionarys.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government scholarships, Lee said.
“China is not the one who is leading academic leaders, but companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university geniuses to work on AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the US boost its AI efforts.
“I think they should offer residence cards to doctors in AI,” he said.
The Chinese State Council published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Early this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an artificial intelligence center that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the select Artificial Information Committee.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a national security committee on artificial intelligence has not recorded movement for months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum if they change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wished to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute for decades with Greece and that had blocked applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim from its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the result will reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, many members of parliament said they would notice the outcome of the vote and that they would make it final.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority of parliament.
The state commission of elections stated that at 1 p.m. no irregularities had been recorded.
However, the participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters deposited their vote.
“I’ve come to vote for my children, our site is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited his vote for the Macedonian referendum on the change of the country's name that would open the way for his accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placed chairs in front of the mounted tents for those who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high and not by the service door, Kavadarkov added.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we can go to other countries such as China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring such a necessary investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of entry into the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
He said a positive result would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the required.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television network Telma indicated that 57 percent of people consulted planned to vote on Sunday.
That’s 70 percent said he would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it had gained power in May of the past.
See: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, crosses the entire defense of Brighton and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling reported the defense of Brighton with 2-0 Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy to score the goal of the 65th minute.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before heading to the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
It differs from a defense before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English front used the first touch area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton Mathew Ryan's guard with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is going through some problems on the foot," said City coach Pep Guardiola, to reporters.
“We’re talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that’s when it happened.
We were lucky to have marked at that time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial lead in the Premier League confrontation.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball in the depth of the Brighton field in that game.
He sent a beautiful passage to the hollow on the right side to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite pole.
The blue-easts put the ball in the goal before leaving the field.
The City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies party
With the Nationals out of the fight for the elimination, there was not much reason to force another ownership.
But a competitive Scherzer hopes to launch on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the Rockies, which take a lead match to Los Angeles Dodgers in the western Division of the national league.
The Rockies were secured at least one position in the wild with the 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they continue to try to close their first division title.
“While we don’t play anything, at least we can touch rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with the other team would probably play at the highest level I played this year.
Why don’t I want to compete in that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the opener on Sunday, but it seems that Scherzer is what starts in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom his 34th start, made another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on his usual rest day.
The Washington destroyer is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 starkeouts at 220/3 entries this season.
Trump celebrates a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the result in the mid-term elections.
“We played everything we did in November.
It’s been five weeks away from the most important elections in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't compete, but I really do it and that's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates," he said.
Trump continued to say, “You see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look at what’s happening now.
And they are determined to regain power using any necessary means, evil, and mesquinity.
They don’t care who hurt, above who they have to pass to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control and we’re never going to give it.”
Democrats’ mission is to oppose and hinder.”
“And they’ve seen that past four days,” he said, calling Democrats “noyed, brave, nasty and liars.”
He listed the Senate Judicial Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by the name, who received strong public apups.
“Do you remember your answer?
Filtered the document?
Mmm..ejem, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... It was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, the truth is that I wasn’t surprised too much.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who are not well received, and all to say our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan was treated similarly because he faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and Europe, casually topics on which Jeremy spread to previous leaders.
Notice for the Labour Meeting of Nottingham East on Friday indicated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I have been a Labour deputy, the committee’s Friday night meetings were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a “more kind and gentle” policy has been forgotten long ago, if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged if all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader of the party, when colleagues he believed to share a similar political vision began to expect me to portray and take positions with which he would never agree with, whether in the field of national security as the EU single market.
When I speak publicly, and in reality, it doesn’t matter what I say, there’s a tremendous dawn and attacks on social media by censoring the center policy, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments that are addressed to me are often political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult were normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with each movement of “non-confidence” or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower of sights.
Over the past few years I have received many advice that urge me to keep my head crouched, not so frank and that then "everything would go well for me".
I didn’t get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 while still in school, taken by the neglect of Thatcher's government that had literally dropped my class, I tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both being local councillor and government minister.
I never hid my policy, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused with my political positions and in which I disagree with the current leadership of the party.
To those who promoted the Friday motion, the only thing I would say is that as long as the country walks towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, companies and public services, I do not understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: An Invict Ayr Heads
The last two attempts may have changed the final result a little, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved to win this kind game of Tenent Premier League.
They are now leading the table and is the only unfeated team of the ten.
It was finally the superiority of his defense, as well as the risking, took him the team to victory. And coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
“So far, we’ve tried them in our party and we’re still invited, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "You have to recognize that the Ayr took advantage of the better opportunities than others."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute essay, transformed by Frazier Climo, put ahead of the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, ceded to the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot set a wrong throw.
Climo increased the advantage for the Ayr with a penalty, before, just in half a half-time, transformed a solo shot, leaving the 17-5 marker in favor of the Ayr in rest.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop for the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, who left the field in padola and, from the restart, Ayr advanced further through a Stafford McDowall essay, transformed by Climo.
The captain in roles dde Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having another player with an essay by Bruce Colvine that was not consumed, at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for boarding Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson scored an essay from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he did almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe had collected the launch in David Armstrong's area and sent him to the third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth rehearsal from the local team.
Still Game's protagonist begins a new career in the restoration industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be prepared to enter the restoration industry after being discovered that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-starizes with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final, and it seems that Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a source of the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosper business of restaurants".
The Sea is Ours: Inner Bolivia expects the court to walk to the Pacific
The sailors watch a naval headquarters covered in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are denied the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
In Bolivia without sea, the memory of a lost coast against Chile in a bloody conflict of resources of the 19th century continues to live, as does the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Perhaps these hopes are at its peak in decades, as Bolivia expects a decision from the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX’s sentence on giant screens throughout the country in the hope that the Hague Court is pronounced in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile is forced to negotiate the concession to Bolivia of a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also has much at stake in Monday’s sentence.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia reason, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations-based body in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory, and stipulated that it will not determine the result of possible conversations.
The fact that the CIX sentence comes only six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", says Chilean expert in international law Peace Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the past four years could be delayed.
“The topic of access to the sea has been blocked for a long time by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales's belligerent rhetoric undermined the goodwill left for Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
Both countries have been without exchanging ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had been making an unusually fast decision.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile", and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this issue for political purposes.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong says his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment is at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart stagnant nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims it is "a utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to a statement ending the Korean War can double the North.
In Washington, the statement was refused to accept the statement without Pyongyang giving the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompey plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion parades reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or cover up completely from the sun, look no more.
Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on the gateway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that embraced the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers took their most amazing creations to the gateway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a wide wing imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large accessories there were crowded watermelons, a magician's hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high sewing.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving team, glasses and tube, and others a melted ice cream cone.
If you are a fan of the fashion of the huge, you are lucky.
The fashion understoods predicted that giant hats could reach the tents.
The disproportionate hats come just after the "Bomba", the straw hat with a 60-centimeter ab that takes everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that is behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks brought another great creation to the walkway: a straw beach bag almost as large as the model attacked with a bathing suit that carries it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flocos and finished with a white leather wing, was the prominent piece of Jacquemus' La Riviera's summer 2019 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Famous Luke Armitage designer declared FEMAIL: “I hope the hats and big beach bags arrive at the stores next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for obversize accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills Are Essential to the People of the World
Private schools in Scotland maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored study plan, we are seeing that modern languages remain a popular and desired theme within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language you understand, that comes to his head.
But if you talk to him in his own language, he will come to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Of the results of this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and with the highest approved rates in private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages have obtained an outstanding one.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that make up SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained honorary enrollment in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved outstanding.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently taking the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs and of all kinds.
A survey conducted by the Commission for Employment and Training in 2014, indicated that among the lack of language knowledge is 17% of the reasons why employers cost them to cover vacancies.
Language skills are increasingly essential to prepare youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job possibilities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong ability like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will place a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, in this case 15%.
It is so important to invest in a language for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find significant employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classic modern languages, while others choose languages considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what their children’s interests are, private schools always have several languages to choose and specialists in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future is missing.
We cannot deny that at this time, in a global business environment, that languages remain of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
The faut well does it.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the fans who wish to see LeBron James playing for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Team coach Like Walton announced that James will play the early preseason match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still remains to be decided how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than 1 and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the training of the early week, they asked James for their pre-season plans for six Lakers games.
At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready,” he said.
Trump’s election events arrive in Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be Trump’s first of five scheduled sets for next week, including stops in cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of paused confirmation for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacant, Trump intends to gain support for the next half-term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing Congress control when voted in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia and how can you see it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p. m. ET.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia to follow via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably address the issue of trial this week to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense for accusations of inappropriate sexual conduct and which keeps Senate confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this series of rallys is to help Republicans face the November elections with a new boost.
Therefore, these five rallys Trump will give next week have the aim of “dynamicizing volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Congress control is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible from the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman who preferred not to be nominated.
This night’s rally, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could gather supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage of Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Western Virginia Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey, last in surveys.
“It’s not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in surveys,” said Simon Haeder, a polythologist at the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until the individual Sunday matches
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pulse oscillating pendulum is a fully invented sporting concept but in which athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
Where would you say that the impulse is now?
“They had a six-point lead and now there are four, so I guess we took that as a little momentum,” Jordan Spieth said as he was leaving at the end of the day.
Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel like they have a little wind in favor and much for what to get excited, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each has three points of four.
Spieth was lethal from the tee to the gren and is preaching with the example.
These guttural screams became stronger as their round progressed, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
When he got the putt that made them win the game in 15, he put a similar scream, the kind of scream he says he thinks the American team is not yet out.
“You just have to focus and worry about your game,” Spieth said.
It’s the only thing left for these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four of four and cannot be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way it seems to flow its energy to the crowd and from it, confirms them as rivals to hit Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to win when the sun sets over Le Golf National that Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both in different holes.
However, talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly detached Sergio García, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he appeared with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first route ended Spanish and Swedish in a hole they were never close to leaving.
There will be no one on Sunday to help you get out of the hole.
The fourballs and foursoms are so fascinating to see closely by interactions between couples, the advice they give, those who don’t, and how it can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the last day, but this foursom session also showed that Team USA has a endurance to fight, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and foursoms with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the cargo with two wins over a Tiger Woods with difficulty climbing four points to the scoreboard at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who seeks to retain the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning footballs, putting the 3-1 series.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursoms, winning four games, but they were unable to cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from the 12 individual Sunday games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to earn four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Melliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points of the four initial games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they fit perfectly to defeat an uninched Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with 5&4 more categoric.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without sorrow or glory, showed occasional brilliant beams, but now lost 19 of 29 games in the modalities of fourballs and foursoms and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morningballs, reunited with his partner Henrik Stenson at the foursoms holding a defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in southwestern Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference point for Americans to score two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the baseball and won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursoms after losing the first two holes.
There were only twice in Ryder Cup history in which a team scored four points in the individual, although as the current trophy headline, the Furyk team only needs to tie it to preserve it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Cora says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions increased their distrust in the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important measures to show its goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing camps and commit to the proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see the corresponding response from the United States,” he added.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first on our part.”
While Ri resumed the already well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to "gradual" denuclearization by virtue of which North Korea would be rewarded as it adopted measures, its statement seemed important, as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it had occurred with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to the "denuclearization" of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump secured North Korean security.
North Korea seeks a formal end for the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that first Pyongyang must depose its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted relaxing the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on “denuclearization first” and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal of coercive eti, and even oppose the “declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream, for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions sharpen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader mentioned in the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the corea peninsula would not have reached a dead point."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after Trump called Kim "the rocket man on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who threatened to “fully destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage by taking action to disarmament, but said there is still a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said there was no time limit for it, and that “it takes two years, three or five months.”
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that: “The fulfillment of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut the funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompey met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would return to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn’t go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had advanced, just a few hours after North Korea denounced him for making "mafious demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "conresponding measures".
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he requested were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the advance towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new Harvard University course is causing all its students to sleep more in order to combat the growth of sexist culture to study all night stimulated by caffeine.
An academic found that university students number one in the world often don’t know the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham and Muller Hospital, conceived the course, who believes he is the first of this type in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that the lack of sleep had on learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up and said, ‘Why do I only tell you this now in my last year?”
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The course of an hour of duration involves a number of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee bowls, curtains, trainers and books to obtain information about the effects of caffeine and light and how the sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine when it comes to bed.
In another section, participants are informed of how prolonged sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, brain spills, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it won’t change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco,” Czeisler added.
The culture of pride of spending all night awake still exists, he says. And adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students who involved lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensure that you sleep enough and have a good quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, it points out. Even avoid getting fat, since the lack of sleep makes the brain come in the way of starvation, which makes him hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course throughout the campus.
The next step, wait, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider the option of setting an alarm to lie down, as well as when they wake up. It is also recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalanced the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 loss in Livingston.
Ibrox's team intended to record their first home win since the 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach, which left his team eight points from the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and an alignment of the Rangers with little inspiration never felt like it was tied.
While the Rangers descended to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a goal of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to have dealt with a head injury after the supposed launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that dragged the Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 of Livingston that took a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organized set suffocated his opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have marked in just two minutes when Menga's first-time short pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot by Keaghan Jacobs arrived at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensemate Alan Lithgow, only managed to stick him in the second stick.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Without a doubt, Alfredo Morelos felt that they would have to have stoned penalty at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only fired two shots at the door in the first half, but the former Ibrox guard, Liam Kelly, had only problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head finish and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed again by facing Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fell the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blood to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted on the break by changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the Zurd made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting one ball long after another.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead in the final moments, but McGregor got up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow fits from the cornea.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty by entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson returned to make the eye fat.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our almanac of the "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and counted... was the day when the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Home: “What is that in the world?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When these headphones are placed, the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of minerals can be heard.
Evans: "Tell me, you're probably bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
The invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells and kill them.
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer and reinject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "impulates the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients and "sign" to address cancer cells worked on the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on Trump’s speech by wearing a MAGA hat (Make America Great Again) after his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
The result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West pushed Kanye West in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised US President Donald Trump, and said he would run as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a cap of Make America Great Again, he criticized Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to white and say, “How can you like Trump if he’s racist?”
If I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault demands made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded West's critical images to social media.
It is not clear whether Rock tried to mock West with this post.
West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time on the scenes due to his cap.
“They passed with me on the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out with that hat.”
I was intimidated!
And then they said I was going to pick up,” said the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want me to see how I'm going to pick up?" saying I would "use my superman cap, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do." You want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments sparked at least twice and members of the cast of SNL seemed to be ashamed, informed Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave the publication: "All the studio was in absolute silence".
They had appointed West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former young man, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people perplexed with a performance of the song I love it ("I love it"), dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West gained support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: thank you for making a cold to the MAFIA"
However, the host of an interview show, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying West was simply “be who he is and that’s completely wonderful.”
“So I chose not to reward anyone (comprising their music or clothing or supporting their “art”) that I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "is officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges for attempted murder for stabging at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place at Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of Magistrates on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor’s Service will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role of sword handling as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantastic series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of sexist hero, saying that these roles on the screen translate into that it seems that young people often have to be hard for them to respect them.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the ?MeToo era (I also).
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-starring Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also admitted that he feels "strong constant" to address the problem.
"Persorally, I feel pretty strong at this time. When are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its very male characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel like that certain part of being a man?
I think it’s really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Something went wrong with the young.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that "horse horses and battlefields".
From November, Kit will star in a replacement by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his encounter with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
“I knew my wife in this program, so somehow I provided my future family and my life from here on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family heritage land in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 82,000 people in the country, the health authorities said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change over the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had practically reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in interannual terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but ensure that discrimination against LGBT people spread.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that a member of staff leaks data from Republican Party senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiratory theories"
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced accusations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three senators from the U.S. Republican Party on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat Democracy said the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the "higher".
“Mentires, lies and more infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included the particular addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, the seat of the United States government, during a Senate panel hearing about accusations of inadequate sexual conduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak appeared a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed the information of a member of Waters staff, communicated the Capitol Hill.
“This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible in any way for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie.”
Waters' statement immediately sparked online reviews, including those of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This disappointment was angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“He doesn’t have a temperament to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t get angry.
It should not be challenging.
You should not question the grounds of the accuser.
It must remain pleasant and serenely.”
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's criticism of Democrats, to which critics accused of appearing too angry during the youth audience.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to discuss Waters in the middle-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“I’m strong if it was true,” he shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department warned "the entities in charge of compliance with the law and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent accusations.
“We will make sure we discover the culprits,” he continued, “so that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team.”
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), Rowan Atkinson's unpowerful spy parody
It is already traditional to seek the transcendence of Brexit in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of this parody and action comedy by Johnny English, who began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will ironic satire become the matter of the evidently stupid that we are in the nation’s new export opportunity?
However, Johnny English's incompetent eye character and rubber face renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comic creation designed for non-English-speaking ciphile territories.
Naturally, it is the silly secret agent who, despite his strange claims of glamur flattering, has a little Clouseau, a little bit of Mr Bean and a piece of that kind that contributed a single note on the theme of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of London 2012 Olympics.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once interpreted the now forgotten Barclaycard television ads, in which he sowed chaos in his way.
There are a couple of good times on Johnny English’s last exit.
I love when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval armor suit and the rotor passes make a brief bang against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps into sight, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when these kinds of "serious" films, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, they already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if humor was directed to children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant misfortunes are not as ingenious or concentrated as Atkinson's silent film jokes by embodying Bean's character.
The argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate is influenced by Britain's supersecret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, for the anguish of the agent who is in service, an unfortunate small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the height for a pompous and conflicted prime minister, who already suffers a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this character who almost looks like Theresa May, but cannot be done much with the script.
His intelligence advisors inform her that as all the spies have committed themselves active, he must take someone out of his retirement.
And that refers to incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but gives extra-official classes about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency information session and gather with their former and suffered partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a man married to a submarine capta, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of His Majesty's Secret Service mistakes return to action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful fatale femme, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the charismatic technological billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their ridiculous hawk odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; they create a riot that illegally puts them aboard the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize yourself with the interior of the house of Volta.
Obviously, all arrests come out of that last sequence, but in the kind and scandalous way it is, seems to be taken from a children's television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: the British film industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but cover for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but cover for five days.
The party wants entrepreneurs to pass the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers offering them an additional free day.
This way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would continue to receive the same salary.
The sources say that the idea would “justize” the party’s economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported the four-day shifts a week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A major source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “It is expected to announce a review of policies before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits the party’s approach to balance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
The Labour Party does not support ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said, “A four-day work week does not enter the party’s policy and is not being considered by it.”
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of the "anonymous directors" and "specculators" in public service companies.
Chancellor's plans in the shadow also imply the possibility that current shareholders of water companies do not recover their entire investment, as a Labour government could carry out "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on business advice and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private sector companies’ shares to employees, which pay annual dividends for a value of up to ?500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds.
FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least one week the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question is presented about whether the department's discoveries could influence him for Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, on the broadcast of an interview, the "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said I'd go to the audience, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the accusation came out and asked if he had done it.
It was firm, determined, resounding.”
Graham’s vote seems immovable.
“My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is determined and would make an explosive accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett denied it roundly," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“The people you mentioned could not verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive star poster that will act and an equally impressive mission, end world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people go to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the actual goal of ending poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively combat it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience had to complete a series of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, make a phone call or any other significant way to help raise awareness about your goal of ending poverty.
What is the degree of success reached by Global Citizen 12 years of achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to request that action be taken or is it just another case of the so-called “clelictivism,” people who think it makes a difference when signing an online request or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its followers, driving a set of different goals.
He says these actions helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion established to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and ads arising from its shares, of which at least $10 billion already paid or raised.
The group estimates that so far guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and executive society that has committed to “helping children to develop to their maximum potential,” with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,400 tweets from Global Citizen.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and supporters of Global Citizen like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a page note of history,” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in favor of improving the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied, “It will be a long and difficult road and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just as it happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to make a “block” to make Russia’s energy exports difficult, U.S. Secretary of Interior said.
"If necessary," Washington can resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including that of the Middle East, revealed U.S. Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examinner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at legitimate government instances, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the officer, they have the ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the capacity, along with the navy, to ensure that the sea roads are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants in the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called itself as the “energy consumer’s voice” in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, considering that, in practice, it is the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is about taking advantage of and replacing fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia saying he “only has one tactic” with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while Trump’s administration was on a mission to boost exports from its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace that of Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "cative" of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which has been established to double the capacity of the existing pipeline at 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The U.S. position gained the reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German-leading German industry organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the United States to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine her candidacy for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully examine her presidential candidacy after the middle-term election.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair the fractured government and that includes a woman in power,” she said.
“After November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency.”
Warren opposed President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was “lifting this country through the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet "of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote."
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it has been shown that most Warren’s own voters do not believe it will be presented in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts’ “probables” voters said the senator would not submit her candidacy, according to the survey of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe’s Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the former governor's candidacy, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other prominent Democratic names in relation to a possible candidacy in 2020, include former vice president, Joe Biden, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder (TEPT) at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, they arrested and accused him of a domestic violence incident.
“With what my own son is happening, with what’s going on again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of the TEPT and some of the wounds our soldiers return to,” Trump told the audience at Donald Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo theme and that his son and other war veterans, "turn different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for what militia and aviators, as well as other army members, offered to the country."
They were arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused him of domestic violence over a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and Columbia District challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal in relation to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district presented a friendly report from the court in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, told NBC News.
The full name of the demanding part of Grace v. Sessions price that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Union for Civil Liberties) presented in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that American officers rejected her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence.
Columbia District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignor decades of state, federal and international legislation".
“Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be admitted according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such prohibition violates that principle,” he explained in the court’s friendly report.
Prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects immigrants’ entry into the US economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they “forget labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
“The asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear for race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his announcement of politics on June 11.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all problems (including all serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting more and more.
“The circumstances are very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby in the evacuation center of the city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance comes with bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed houses, collecting their drowned belongings, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes while explaining how he felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," Haris told Associated Press, and added that his family was at a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife ask for help and then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of abuse with "propagandistic announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in an American newspaper preaching the benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of serving the US press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, referred to China Daily's payment supplement at Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa state, after accusing China of entertaining himself in the US Congress elections, which will be held on November 6, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to entertain himself in the US election, marked what officials in that country coined in Reuters as a new phase of Washington’s growing campaign to coerge China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war witness to the level of tariffs on their respective imports.
According to China and US experts, China’s compensatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to harm state exporters such as Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed workers, farmers and American entrepreneurs.
In a opinion paper written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of Moines Register, China was exposed to “tensifying that campaign of harassment by spreading propaganda ads in the free American press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the appreciated American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing a payment announcement at Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in the newspaper post at the end of this Beijing street, they are few dissident voices and no real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese may have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, since the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He also states that "one of China's most important newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not confirm what newspaper it is.
Kavanaugh disaster loses women's Republican vote a few days after half-term elections
Although many of the top Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, Supreme Court candidate, despite different allegations of sexual assaults, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially female voters, in the next half-term elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous and most Republicans opposed to move forward with the vote.
“These things cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell school at Syracuse University in a Sunday article in The Hill.
Reeher also claimed that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizone) for an FBI investigation is enough to calm down the moods of angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, as will they not forget it in the near future or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, lead advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, the opponents, to the "Accept November!", demonstrated in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans, with the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, said Mic.
“The motivation and enthusiasm of Democrats will overcome any expectation,” said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
“It’s already high,
But it will still be more, especially among the undecided female voters in the outskirts or of those who are between 18 and 29 years old, which although they do not like the President, they do not usually go to the polls.
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if Republicans continued to confirm.
“This became a disaster for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week on NBC News.
“This goes beyond the committee’s vote, final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the defendants’ bank or not. The problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps the election of Democrats on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between Ford's or Kavanaugh's testimony being believed, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of respondents fully or probably believe Ford's testimony, compared to 35% supporting Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh lies most likely during his testimony, compared to 30% who thinks the same as Ford.
After the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's charges, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of drunkenness when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him the genitals at a university party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web creator wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee’s open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and that people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee chance that the intention that hides Inrupt is "dominating the world".
“We have to do it,” he said.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal data storage online” or POD.
Contact lists, lists of pending tasks, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify have been available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company calls this a “personal empowerment through data”.
Inrupt's idea, according to President John Bruce, is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM-owned security company, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke with "Facebook or Google about whether or not to introduce a full change that would modify his business models from day to the next.
“We don’t need your permission.”
In a paper published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based website."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has risen as an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Tribute to Bernard Vann, a cleric decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on 29 September 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, not knowing that he was awarded the greatest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were in charge of discovering a memorial in his honor in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after the feat of his grandfather who deserved the title.
According to London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion by the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the yoke of intense machine guns fire".
He later rushed to reach the line of fire and, with a "great courage", directed the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without anyone's help, and tear down three people from enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was assassinated by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather’s actions are “something I could never live with, but a lesson yet.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the parade, which led the young band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts the roll to MMA fans at the best time
Imagine you've been smart all night to enjoy Bellator's full show 206, and when you get the best part something prevents you.
The San Jose poster included 13 fighting, with six main ones, and was broadcasting live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald would see their faces, UK spectators were perplexed when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some people didn’t impress them after having spent so many hours waiting to see the fight.
An amateur described the change to these children's drawings on Twitter as "a joke of very bad taste".
“State regulations govern that this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and that’s why he had to switch to child programming,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Marketing and Communication at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will take into account UK viewers in future programming.
“I think we can solve it when we think about repetition,” Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. there, we can’t fix it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
We are working to find a solution.
When the change occurred, I started receiving many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won’t happen again.
We will limit five fights, instead of six. We wanted to give the most to our fans, but we pass and
It hurts a lot of anger.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior due to his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, claims that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete said she didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he arrived at high school.
Guest of the first broadcast of the Desert Island Discs program on Radio 4 led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is down due to illness.
As a guest of Laverne's first program, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked children".
He said: “To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what has driven me and gave me the strength necessary to achieve success.”
I wanted to prove that it was "someone" so that people had not been disappointed in discovering their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Commonwealth Games of Australia to ask for more countries that had decentralized homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
Three-time world champion said he fell in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was a surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
“When you live so much in such a short time” (at only 14 years old first participated in an Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone of your age who had experienced similar lows.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth caused Daley to completely change his perspective.
“If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal,” he said.
“But now I know there are much more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
My medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
Daley's father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked his son were tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell you I wouldn’t be here to take that front row,” Daley said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that precise moment, at the time of his death, when I realized it wasn’t really invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“At that moment I knew that was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling.”
The choice of Heather Small's song is also not in vain, as it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on the tip.

A low-shaped Mickelson ended up at Ryder Cup bank this Saturday
Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to improve his technique so that it does not become an unhappy event.
Mickelson, who participated in the biennial event for 12th time, stayed in the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in Saturday's funerals.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day encouraging and working to improve their movements.
Although it was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the height of their career, at the age of 48 it does not fit the tight Le Golf National field, where the tall grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And if this wasn't enough, Mickelson faces the ninth Sunday game to precise Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If Americans, four points below when starting the 12 individual games, start with a good foot, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, although he couldn’t say much more.
“He perfectly understood the role he played today, gave me a palm in my shoulder, passed my arm and told me that tomorrow he would be ready,” Furyk said.
“He was fully confident in himself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams last week.
I probably didn’t think he played two games.
I thought I would play more, but in the end that’s how things were and so we think they should be.
Like everyone else, they want to be out there.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record in the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
He could score the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual palm trees.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangible to the team.
“He’s a fun, sarcastic person, with engineer and likes to get involved with people, he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he said.
“I like to see how good the youngest players have been with him this week.
He is much more with a good player.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, is afraid of the disappearance of the advantage.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows for experience that a considerable advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup individuals can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Danish debuted in 1997 in a game in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but ended up reaching the finish line with a minimum advantage winning 141-131.
“You keep thinking we had a big advantage in Valderama; just as in Brookline, where we lost, but at Valderama we won for a little,” Bjorn said in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go for everyone.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This is not done until the points are on the scoreboard.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I won’t get tired of saying it, I’m focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I’m also very aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted with the performance of his players on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we will face another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of the individual performances, and we also have to show our worth.
It’s great to be with a partner next to you when things go well, but when you face things individually, then you can test your ability as a golfer.
That’s the message you need to convey to players, which get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek his players to have better individual performance than with his teammates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of the last day, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but finishing as a loser after the European miracle in Medinah.
"I remember each of the damn words," he replied when he was asked if he remembered himself as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered players in front of the last day.
“We have 12 important games, but you would like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah’s.
When you see that the impulse goes in one direction, there is a lot of pressure in these intermediate parties.
We prepare our alignment by taking this into account and put players as it seemed, we want to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the upper half of the standings.
“I decided this order because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn explained about his selection for the individual.
The new German warship postponed once again
The youngest frigate in the German Navy should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not reach until at least next year due to defective systems and the increasing cost, local media reported.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class fratas, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but subsequent delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
They are understood to have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-buke missiles, as well as concealment technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy the youngest frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a boat to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but German communications media spoke of "concisive effects on software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, as Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the staff needed in the former Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had an excess of dramatic weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7 thousand tons Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the total price of the project, which includes crew formation, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it already reaches the amazing amount of €3100 million, compared to the initial 22 billion.
The problems of younger frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is making water.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships that are still running out.
The officer claims that this problem is increasing, as old ships have been removed, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust Spys the Secret Life of Bats
A new research that is being conducted on a Scottish Highlands estate aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to seek food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland association will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipisterllus pipistrellus, as well as the bat Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the Invewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An analysis of sound by experts from all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
Then, a habitat map will be developed to create a detailed image on the scale of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor to the nature of NTS, hopes that the results show that areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as prairie creation and what is the best way to keep forests for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works affecting children and habitat loss.
Aerogenerators and lighting also pose a risk, as well as glue traps for flies, some chemical treatments of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
The bats are not blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is taken very seriously by bats.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct surveys periodically, child inspections and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organization also has the only and first Scottish bat reserve in Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
David Thompson, Estate manager, claims that this is the ideal territory for them.
“We have a large area for bats,” he said.
“We have ancient buildings, historical trees and a great habitat.
But there are many things we don’t know about bats yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks in properties, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity child can kill up to 400 females and young, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
“There is still a lot to learn about bats and, in the case of many species, we don’t know how it is going to their populations.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape demands and his lawyers prepare to sue German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo calls rape complaints against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get to know each other using his name.
His lawyers will ask the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these accusations.
Portuguese and Juventus' frontman was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that the footballer paid the woman $35,000 to say nothing about the incident, said Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after its release, Ronaldo, 33, recorded this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which counts 142 million followers.
“No, it’s not a thousand times.
What was said today is false,” said the five-time Golden Ball winner.
“People want to know each other using my name.
It is normal,
They want to be famous to say my name, it’s part of my job.
I am a happy and respectable man,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare to sue Der Spiegel for accusations, which they call "an unacceptable statement of suspicions in the privacy area" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would ask for compensation for "moral damage for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the personal rights of recent years".
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019, in a suite of the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where she allegedly raped her anally, according to the documents presented at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, knelt down saying he was 99 percent a gentleman, but that 1% had betrayed him.
The documents say Ronaldo confirms that both had sex consented by both sides.
Mayorga also argues that he went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because he was terrified of retaliation and was concerned about public scorn.
The 34-year-old woman says she seeks to revoke the deal while she continues to traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve into a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Car manufacturers would leave UK
The UK would forever regret the loss of its position as the world leader of car manufacturing after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK had claimed on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, he would temporarily stop the production of its Burnaston factory near Derby.
“We need to reach an agreement,” Clark added.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit had not reached any deal, the impact of border delays could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, responsible for the manufacture of Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the EU.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses to how production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, director general of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers also expressed their fear of EU abandonment without reaching an agreement on border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant at Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in case a Brexit deal is not reached.
Toyota’s production line is very tight, every 37 minutes of UK and EU suppliers arrive for custom-made cars.
If on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and delays and shortages of parts could be generated.
The company claims it would be impossible for Toyota to keep a normal pace more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future EU relations is “calibrated accurately to avoid such border controls.”
"It's essential to have an agreement. And we want it to be the best deal, so to enjoy the current success but also take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Ally show.
“The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains.”
Toyota could not estimate how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run added costs would reduce plant competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, Burnaston employee for 24 years and Union coordinator of Unite, said his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these works disappear, they never return.
A government spokesman said they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
The White House said Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting and the Undersecretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed another week due to the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, links between Russian and Trump assistants, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump dismisses the deputy prosecutor, and if he does not, what would endanger Mueller's independence, he fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President through 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, among reports indicating that he was about to resign.
A meeting with Trump was announced, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate court committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered an investigation into the FBI on complaints against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied, “There is no fixed date yet, it could be this week or delay another week, given everything that is happening in the supreme court.
We’ll see, but you know I like the press to be informed.”
Some journalists questioned this claim, as Sanders has been taking since September 10 without holding a press conference.
When the host Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said the lack of information session was not due to an aversion to the grandioquence of reporters, although she added that it will not be she who denies that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president grants more interviews than the previous president,” he said, although he did not mention any sources that endorsed that data.
Sanders said: “If the press has the opportunity to ask the president directly, that this is much better than addressing the questions to her.
You are witnesses of how we have been doing this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can talk directly to the President of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries visitors.
However, solo press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free and strange appearance before the journalists gathered.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm the encouragement to Brexit
The Health Secretariat has directed a letter to EU workers at the NHS in Scotland expressing the country’s gratitude and communicates their desire to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has committed to covering the cost of requests for status covered for EU citizens working on their decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment continued, and decisions are planned this autumn.
However, the UK government has also intensified its preparations for a possible non-deal situation.
I know this is a period of concern for everyone.
I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The European Union and beyond, provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.”
Christion Abercrombie subjected to emergency surgery after head injury
Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, was subjected to emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's defeat (31-27) against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ de Tennesseean reported.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State coach, informed reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
He apparently fainted when he reached the band line.
Coaches and medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking it on a truck to perform a later assessment.
A Tennessee State coach informed Chris Harris, WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He also added that there are no details of the type or reach of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year-old red-shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five total tickets on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised his total 18th of the season to 18.
A membership tax will apply to foreign buyers who buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher membership tax when they buy a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help homeless people under new conservative plans.
This will neutralize the success of the Corbyn campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in membership tax will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to ?20 million stelings a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher membership tax when they buy a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible homes and focus on people with high income.
The increase in membership tax will apply to people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will serve to support the government campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The collection, which is added to the current bell tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases to rent, may be up to 3%.
The change expects the change to raise up to ?20 million a year.
About 13% of new constructions in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which is causing a price increase and making it difficult for people who want to buy a home for the first time more difficult to access the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "honour cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson requested the application of a cuts in the estate transmission tax to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused the great builders of maintaining high housing prices by buying soil and non-use of this, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate tax revenue percentages on moderate price homes to fix the “severeness of the housing sector” that is lived in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposals for housing-related reforms, including the control of the renters and the ban on the challenges in which the tenant is not to blame.
He also wants to give the municipalities greater powers when building new homes.
Mrs. May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restore the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
This is why we need to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to what you want to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is equally easy for those people who do not live in the UK, as well as for foreign-based companies, buy homes that for British workers.
For too many people, the dream of being owners of a house is too far away, and the indignity that means not having a roof remains too real.”
Jack Ross: “My last ambition is to train Scotland”
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "last ambition" is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
This 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northwestern club, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in the B selection, and that was all,” Ross said to BBC Scotland’s Sportsound show.
“I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a kid, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club.”
Ross's predecessors include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Alladyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic manager claims that he felt no concern for succeeding those consolidated figures in such a large club after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The success for me will depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the club’s structure and facilities are undoubtedly typical of a Premier League club,” he said.
“It won’t be a simple task to get there, but it’s likely that I just thought I’ve achieved success here if I can return the club to Premier.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years after a period of assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month period within Hearts technical staff.
At that period he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St Mirren to be on the verge of descending to win the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than ever found during his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“I was probably at a royal crossroads,” he recalled, about taking over the Alloa.
“I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because it wasn’t bad, I reasonably gained my life and enjoyed some successes.
Playing can be hard.
There are many things you need to exceed every week.
I still suffer from stress and pressure from work, but I like it.
I have always loved training and now that I am doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a pint is 17:30 a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
pubs and bars experienced a growth of 2.7 percent during July, but consumption in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent according to figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the commercial advisor CGA, in charge of compiling the figures, stated: "The sunny days and the permanence of England in the world of football for longer than expected, caused in July a similar pattern to that of June, in which pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although restaurants suffered even greater punishment.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the turnover of restaurants during June worsened during July.
The pubs and bars specialized in beverages were the best results achieved with higher consumption increases than reductions experienced by restaurants.
Food-specialized pubs also suffered the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out to drink.
In pubs and controlled bars, drinking consumption increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and that of meals was reduced by three percent.
Paul Newman, a RSM employee of leisure and hospitality activity analysis, said: “These results represent a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events remain the main factors related to consumption outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a drop of 4.8 percent annually will be especially painful if this is added to the continued increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have arrived at a worse time for restoration businesses and time will be in charge of saying whether moderation of temperatures experienced during August will provide the so necessary breath for the sector.
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, which reflects slowdown in brands' launches.
The sales indicator Coffer Peach Tracker Industry of the UK pub sector, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with joint profits of more than ?9 billion and is considered the reference point of the sector.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents.
One in five children (some of only 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey
A survey conducted at 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of pages of "Fake Island"
This news has increased from fear of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “principal” account to show their parents.
One in five children (some of only 11 years old) are creating social media accounts that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted at 20,000 high school students has highlighted a growth in the number of accounts of "Fake Island" (in reference to the social network of Instagram photo exchange).
This news has led to an increase in fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they used a softened "principal" account to show their parents while they had others private.
A mother who met the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked her to "viol her".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent scools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC manager Mike Buchanan said: “It is alarming that there are so many teenagers tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the advice of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the advice of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport benefit from her extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys enormous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit greatly from its incorporation into the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I am looking forward to making athletes’ spokesperson and I hope I can contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games between a total of four Olympic golds and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented him from being able to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and to what extent.
It was a exhausting job, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and I do agility exercises.
Thanks for the encouragement messages.”
An announcement of a maternal milk extractor compared to women with cows divides public opinion into networks
A company of maternal milk extractors divided public opinion on networks with an ad compared to lactating mothers with cows to which it is muxing.
To announce the launch of the proclaimed "first silent portable maternal milk extractor in the world", Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new milk extractor to mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of ugly for cows at the rhythm of a song with lyrics like the following: "Yes, I move myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't realize it, they're not ubres, they're my breasts."
The choir continues: "Muxe, muxe, I'm feeding babies, muxe, I'm moving my friends."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy in the networks.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that it highlights the "horres" of the dairy sector.
“Utilizing cows to announce this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in their case we steal their children days after giving birth,” he wrote.

Another viewer commented on the following: "Clarly traumatic for the mother and baby.
Why aren’t they used to announce a milk extractor for mothers left with their babies?”
Another viewer added the following: "What a announcement with so little touch."
Other viewers defended the announcement, even a woman claimed that the song seemed "very funny".
“It seems to me that’s a great idea.
If I had my chest, I would buy one.
My milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit silly, but I interpret it as a joke.
It seems like a great product,” one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun announcement addressed to mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like "vaccas".
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept of the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the milk extractor Elvie is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be discreetly fit into a maternal subjector, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director of Mother commented: "The extractor Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By describing the parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it entails while showing in an entertaining and close way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This is not the first time that the excerpt Elvie has occupied the headlines of the newspapers.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the walkway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved silently to a camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children detained increased despite the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to assign godparents to children.
Traditionally, most godparents were also immigrants without papers and were afraid to endanger their ability to stay in the country taking a step forward to claiming a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior position of the U.S. Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified to Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who requested to sponsor minors without a company.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal record.
“I close to 80% of people who are godparents or who are part of the home of these are illegally found in the country, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
We will continue to pursue these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In order to process children faster, officials introduced new rules that will require that any of these appear in court before one month has passed since their arrest instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the workers of the shelter.
Many will appear through videoconferencing instead of person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they will have to become anxious or depressed, which can cause violent assaults or flight attempts according to shelter workers and reports of the system published over the past few months.
Lawyers said these fears increase in larger-dimensional centers such as Tornillo, in which there is more chance that the symptoms that a child is having a child doing it badly go unnoticed due to its size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them from an emotional point of view or to say goodbye to friends could pose a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls for occupation forces from the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "oppose them in the timely manner".
“They must withdraw immediately and without conditions,” he said.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them had to flee their homes.
He also claimed that Damascus would continue to "fighting this sacred battle until we clean all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "of all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this country devastated by war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem declared that the conditions appropriate for their return were given and blamed for "some Western countries" of the "disfusion of irrational fears" that caused refugees not to return.
“We are going to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warned that they will not offer help for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and opposition occurs to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone on Idlib's last major rebel bastion allowed us to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the province, in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "light limit dates" and expressed its hope that military actions are destined by Shihadists, including Al-Nusra front soldiers linked to Al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of government and opposition to develop a draft of a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem exposed the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned in the face of possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals will be waiting, impeachment and scandals end their presidency prematurely.
It would be the “most dramatic end of a presidency.”
There are no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, prime-time audience rates have multiplied by more than two, to reach 1.05 million viewers on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on prime-time time, an increase of 1.7 million compared to four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable channel audience indexes with 3.5 million viewers during the nights when important news occurred.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, a showrunner of the drama for ABC, which is a ministerial cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nel Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Fundy Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Thinking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He replied, "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell said.
There is entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the plots that arise from Washington can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, if migrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
To disconnect from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Still, it is something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spending six hours watching a panel of experts debate about Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin jacket ("a garment full of arrogance," said Washington Pos) and the implications of Paul Manafort's grocy descriptions.
I won’t look at Super Mario again the same way.
“Part what makes it look like a reality show is that it’s giving you something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, senior executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars”, a space that deals with changes in the characters and daily arguments of Trump’s show (the conflict with N.F.L., the praises Kim Jong-un...).

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he made sun and a temperature of 26 degrees out of the house, on the northern coast of Kauai, but was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to disengage while Brett Kavanaugh was about to confront the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs at that time and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

External money reaches moraines to finance candidates for the elections of half the legislature
It is no surprise that the 17th Pennsylvania congressional district is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two representatives in roles in the race to occupy the same position.
This district located outside Pittsburgh which was recently reorganized is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his post in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is presented against another acting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superimposed on the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined in January that Republicans had manipulated the electoral constituency of the ancient districts in their favor.
The election race in the new 17th congressional district unleashed a campaign financing festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Congress Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after winning a tight victory in the March special elections for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which enjoyed broad follow-up.
That position was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States assessed the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for his support for China and then went back.
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners threw the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the State Department decided to order to return to the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement that same month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid during 2017, included to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the emigration of people to the United States.
But in mid-September, leading administration officials made it clear that they wished the conference to progress, effectively ending any possibility of applying sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to direct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance given by the administration, diplomats said.
The three American envoys returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations as long as the anonymity of the participants remained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration and who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Studying History
The next negative case could be the report by special advisor Robert Mueller on the case of possible obstruction of Mr. Trump’s justice, of which there is currently abundant evidence in the public archive.
Mr. Mueller is also conducting his investigation to find out if Mr. Trump’s campaign has conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to hold an account on that body, just when you have to prepare for the elections, and you may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are many unknowns and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, just like that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were determined to strike a coup against Hitler if the Western front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of killings that occurred later.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy accelerates or backward.
Americans face several of these turning points at this time.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses State Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying with water to his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was disabled for office.
Mr. Rosenstein stated that The Times information is not true.
How will we respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not impartial or if his appointment is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And above all, will we vote in the half-legising elections for a Congress that demands responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we don’t pass these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
I don’t think we’ll fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my house, which was the seat of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to arrest Shabat's candis on that table that included a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers receives the Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw achieved in Spain against Villarreal this same month, would put them in a very favorable position to qualify in the G group of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans debut this season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but believes that Rangers can use that result as a trampoline to get more important things.
“It was a good point for us, as Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old player said.
“We came into the game believing that we could get something positive and we got a point.
We had the opportunity to win at the end, but in general, the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second half we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great night.
We hope we can reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last game, but with the support of our audience, I am sure we can fight to achieve a positive result.
Last year was hard among everything that happened with my injuries and the changes produced on the team, but there is an excellent environment right now.
The team is good, the kids are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget the last season and succeed.”
Women are concerned about savings for their retirement.
Despite the fact that participants in the survey were clear how they wanted them to take care of them, few people spoke to their family on the matter.
About half of the participants in this study by Nationwide said they commented with their partners the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of her, but they are not carrying out the necessary measures to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance department.
They can start with the next one.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to care if you don’t communicate your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your advisor and family to agree where and how to receive care, as those decisions can be a determining factor when determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Among prolonged care financing options are a traditional prolonged care insurance policy, a effective hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance covered with your own funds, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to designate a trusted person to monitor your medical care and make sure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
It also values the possibility of signing a notarial power to manage your finances.
You will need to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your father or older mother has a medical emergency and goes on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down in detail that information in a written plan to be prepared.
“Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who attend it?” asked Martin.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Set a plan.”
A man receives several shots with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a compressed air rifle while walking home after leaving at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which occurred about 02:30 (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim did not see the aggressor.
His injuries are not serious and the police are looking for potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the deaths of at least 384 people, a figure expected to continue to increase.
Due to the cutting of communications, rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area located north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake of magnitude.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key data about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Celebes Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Celebes Island, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency found along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of Celebes Island.
This regency, an administrative region lower than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Celebes province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected Donggala's western part in 1996, causing the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Fire Belt of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered over the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra, which occurred on 26 December, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the deaths of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half, in Aceh.
2005: A number of major earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, causing the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake occurred in magnitude near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake affected the Mentawai Islands, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of peoples and killed approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's regency, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people recalled the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami occurred this time, but more than 100 people died due to the fall of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which caused the deaths of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily pulled away.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is arrested for charges of domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaska governor and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested suspected of a crime of domestic violence, to prevent the submission of a complaint for domestic violence and authority resistance, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to denounce the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin remains in pretrial detention in the dependencies of Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a bond of $500, according to KTUU.
He stood before the court on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, of course" when asked, the chain reported.
Palin faces three minor A crimes, which means he could enter prison for up to one year and receive a fine of 250,000 dollars.
He was also charged with a minor crime of type B, punishable with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to denounce the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaskan War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of drunk in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of proposing a fist on his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome she suffers after serving with the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people are killed after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the death balance is expected to increase over the days.
The earthquake occurred just in front of Central Celebes in the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They create videos on the social networks where the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal taxes seek to apply a few times a death penalty for the suspect in a terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway Avenue, drying the lives of pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" that caused them serious injuries "intentionally", according to the notification of the death penalty intention presented in the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes imply the possibility of applying the death penalty according to the court’s document.
Weeks after the attack occurred, a federal jury presented Saipov an imputation of 22 crimes, including eight crimes of murder in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice usually used by prosecutors of organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "notable planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said in describing the way Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to Diego Enrique Angelini's families and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" as indicated in the notification of accusation intention.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago, the Southern District of New York did not process a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of repentance during the days and months following the attack according to court documents.
He told the researchers to feel good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told authorities to carry out the attack, he was inspired by ISIS videos he visualized on his phone according to the accusation.
He also asked to see the IIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He was not guilty of the charge of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal lawyers in charge of representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the accusation.
“We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accepting a declaration of guilt with life imprisonment without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to request the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize a "people army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
Former UK Independence Party leader stated that politicians had to “sit pressure” from the Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May’s own parliamentarians themselves suggested that negotiations with the EU should take care of negotiations.
Ordinary MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham demonstration that the UK would have left the EU if Mr. Farage was the Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May to reconcile the divided ranks of her party came into evidence by joining the favorable Tories to stay in the EU to an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain the commitments of her Chequers plan between Brexit supporters’ attacks on the opposites and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continued to fight to try to secure an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated in the concentration of Solihull's Leave movement that he wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that he should have counted Mr. Farage to take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If we had been in office, we would be out of the EU at this time,” he said.
Wellingborough Parliament member added the following: “I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort Chequers’ plan.”
Showing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We do not fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone denied suggestions indicating that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Brexit member Andrea Jenkyns also went on the march, from which he said to reporters: “The only thing I say is: prime minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers’ plan does not enjoy popularity among public opinion, the opposition will not vote in favor of it, is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Sing Chequer’s plan and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: “The prime ministers retain their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farage stated in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians “feeling” if they intend to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit’s decision and here we’re gathered today to tell them that we won’t let them go out with theirs.”
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the army of people in this country who has given us the victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous UK.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU made a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour concentration in the city center.
A few activists waved banners with the Tories Against Brexit message after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for security problems they suffered in a party application at the start of the conference.
“This is the people who tell us they can have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a frictionless border, to enjoy a free market without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s an absolute farce.
The concept of Brexit doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously think about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously think her candidacy for president after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a municipal session in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critique of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It is a focus on speculations that put it as Trump’s successor in 2020.
Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his voters using the council format since Trump assumed the presidency.
An assistant asked if he planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our government’s problems, and that’s why a woman is needed in the post of the presidency.”
A arrest related to Sims' deadly shooting, the LSU player
Baton Rouge Police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference held at 11:00 (east time).
They released a video of the shooting on Friday requesting help to identify a man who came out of the images.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus at the first hour of Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head and eventually died as a result of this,” said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde stood in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present in the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2-meter youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 wins last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is coming to the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who left pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel pitted first and let Hamilton run in traffic at the back of the group, something that would be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in pits a lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced it after several wheeled maneuvers that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the interior badly free at risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver in the third corner.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the starting grid and retreated to seventh place at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a large part of this thanks to which he retained his tyres to get faster in the final part and advance Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually pitted on lap 44 but was unable to advance any position in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two places,” Hamilton said.
An inappropriate body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday event at his insistence on the time of claiming that he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an act in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee and commented instead that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "missible, disgusting and lying".
“The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the last days in the Senate, when you see outrage, when you see that people who are angry and miserable, disgusting and lying,” he said.
“When you see these posts and leaks and they say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn’t go.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make any leak?
Remember your answer... have you filtered the document?: "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a moment.
“No,” he added by imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent him the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had come from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t filter his story,” Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill.
“I asked him to maintain his confidentiality and did what he asked me to do.”
But his denial did not seem to sit well to the president, who commented the following during Saturday night's act: "I tell you that body language was not the right one.
He may not have filtered it, but he used the worst body language I saw in my life.”
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of inadequate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power through any necessary means.
They are evil and disgusting, they don’t care who harms, who have to run over to regain power and control,” said the president according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat suffered on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants winning the game back 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants achieved an early lead by two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the local ensemble before Dwyer re-established the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third loss in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to climb to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three previous wins for the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal occurred in 3:35 minutes thanks to a assistance by Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assistance.
In an initial period, Sullivan returned to the local team in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to score the goal of the draw in 15:16.
Dwyer assured that the Giants were ahead of the scoreboard before the first break when he scored their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team reunited and Bouchard again tied the game with a goal by power play in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined with each other to help Nielsen advance Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured the victory through their team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home in Milton Keynes their next game, which will be held on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers in an airplane can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered a hero after dying to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many missing after a major earthquake shook Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and many people are trapped under the rubbles of the city of Palu.
Although his co-workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower that was violently swinging.
He stayed in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the exit track at that time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to fall apart.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said it is possible that this decision would allow hundreds of lives to be saved, Australia’s ABC News channel said.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Let us break our hearts when we know,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death balance may be thousands and the country’s disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The balance of victims is believed to continue to rise because there are many bodies under the rubble and could not reach many of them,” said Sutope Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying help and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the mini-markets.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could become much worse.”
Indonesia's president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia has previously suffered earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing plane crash in a lagoon
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing one after previously stating that the 47 passengers and crew had abandoned the aircraft that was sinking without incident.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working together with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to more detailed requests for information about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crash into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy confirmed that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American citizen passenger, commented that he entered at very little height.
“That’s extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to advance between the water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were screaming and scared, and that he suffered a slight wound on his head.
The United States Navy indicated that sailors who were working near the site on the improvement tasks of a dock also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to move people to the coast before the plane sank approximately 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor was sent to the tests on Saturday at the repetition of a man's trial accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described for the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recompose the 29-year-old defendant's movements, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death contradicting his previous claims as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When this data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford got up to the platform on Saturday and testified that day he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "menting, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction consisted that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records said they were only known for a week.
Rowlett stated that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis removed messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He’s crazy about his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would be seen for judgment by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that hip hop moved away from its origins with political messages and fighting social problems.
They want to return to their roots and get the combative hip hop back to be popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a revival in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
New York children's caregiver demands a couple after a "racist" message
A New York child caregiver will demand a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from the mother she complained that she was "another black".
The couple refuses to be racist and compares demand with an “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her distress in discovering that child caregiver Giselle Maurice was black when her first day of work was presented in 2016.
“Noooooooooooon, Another Black,” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her husband to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "incomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that the caregiver who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she expected a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice paid her the day of work and sent her home in an Uber.
Maurice will now sue the couple to obtain compensation for dismissal and requires compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for those who had initially been hired even if there was no contract by means.
“Look, I want to show you that these things aren’t done,” he told the Post on Friday, to later add “It’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to accusations of racism stating that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid to not be able to trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent him a message I didn’t intend to send him.
He is not racist.
We are not racist,” said Joel Plasco to the Post.
“But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, even though it was due to a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on!"
After comparing demand with an "extortion", Plasco declared that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that he was in a "very difficult situation".
“Will they go for a person like that?
That’s not very ethical,” the banker added.
As the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers did not identify with a speaker bear as can be concluded in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the following about the letter: "It's hard to get into the skin of a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s fun to know what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
After claiming that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility of rejecting his work, added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "agridoce" after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom he describes as a "very important member of our family", added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
“He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous,” he said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like if you had a son who got something: you’re proud even if you didn’t really do it.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little like that.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave all merit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye via the phone.
After landing, his daughter was quickly led to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save his life.
“Nad regularly called to say it was very bad, that he was not expected to survive.
“Then I got Nad’s call to tell me I was going to die in the next two minutes and had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave him so that his heart would continue to beat were slowly consuming and abandoning his body.
He had died a while earlier and now he was getting out.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to endure.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapereuse, at that time of mourning for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without the caller she was suffering.
“No one has detected it,” he said.
“I had my head down and tears fell at all times.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this impressive sense of solidarity by Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women's posters to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiration messages and phone numbers that can be called to ask for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer depression, and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel like I have to feel like I have to feel every day,” he said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said their smile lit any room.”
He left the job before he died and was “in a deep depression.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis commented, "I have the ongoing concern that a collateral effect occurs."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you are a friend.
Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” he said.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we detected a change in your attitude.
Christmas Day touched the background (when the children opened their gifts, he made no eye contact with them or anything).
He claimed that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "He grabbed the family.
He challenged us.
We have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs a thread while FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (an investigation for a limited time and limited scope), it is possible that we could get a little unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "beautifying" due to the paralysis of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathizers want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
His reluctance is due to a matter of deadlines.
Five weeks are missing for the half-legation elections (November 6). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to which he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI makes your report?
A Senate vote will be held, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea drops under Kim's mandate
The number of North Korean deserters destined for South Korea has fallen from Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of South Korea, stated that 1,127 defections had occurred last year, far from 2,706 of 2011.
Mr. Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people in charge of passing people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North deserters are finally offered to the citizens of South Korea.
Seoul declares that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the largest border stretch with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriate them mandatory.
Relations between the north and south (which technically continue at war) have improved significantly over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met at Pyongyang to maintain talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This occurred after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, in which they agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States of lack of progress ever since.
“If we have no confidence in the United States, we cannot trust our national security and, under these circumstances, there is no possibility that we are unilaterally discouraged first,” Mr. Ri said in a speech in front of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and claims it is not suitable for accessing the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and claimed that it was not suitable for her nature to access the Supreme Court.
Peloi made these comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman would ever behave that way, they would call it hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement against the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and speaking while describing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee Democrats, cataloging accusations against him as an "assigned of grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals angry with Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Peloi stated that he believed Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because he showed that he had prejudices against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if confirmed in the post and whether Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“What I have to say is this: if you are not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it is not suitable to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court in which you are currently in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. appeals circuit.
Peloi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh may adopt against the patient protection law and accessible health care or the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation views, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be cancelled.
“It’s not the time for a hysterical person to enter the court and even above expect us to say, look good!” Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise it.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and cannot expel it without crying.
“We celebrate when we get angry,” said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s so weird, right?”
She continued to say, "I received a lot of help from a woman who was executive somewhere, who said she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, "You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I am angry.”
And then, he continued.
It seemed brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my most sharp memories in one of my first jobs in an office dominated by men, in which I started crying with an impossible anger to describe, was that a larger woman grabbed me from the back of the neck, a distant superior that had always caused me a slight fear, and led me to the hollow of the staircase.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They believe you are sad and will comfort you if they turn to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in her presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was picked up on an adventure outside of marriage on a ship named Monkey Business and was retired from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider presenting herself to the presidency.
“It wasn’t a well-thought decision,” he told me about laughter 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancaneves and the Seven Dwarves".
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fundraising, so he swore he would not enter the race for the presidency unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of those who supported it contributed $1,000 to male candidates would only give him $250.
“What do you think, I have a discount?” he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters rather than delegates and anger by existing sexism) who remained speechless.
“You would think he had suffered a nervous crisis,” Schroeder recalled how the press reacted with her.
“You would think Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
"Chorou?"
How trade war between the United States and China can be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China have been overwhelming and, although the war is far from over, a distance between countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning earlier this year, recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $200 billion, recording half of the articles coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has countered the same way, the latest rising rates from five to ten percent to $60 million in American products.
China has promised to imitate American measures and it seems unlikely that the world’s second largest economy will change in the short term.
To get Washington back, it would be necessary to give in to its demands, but publicly double to the United States would be much more shameful for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play their cards correctly, pressure from trade war with the United States could favor China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions needed to initiate an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher focused on the Center for New American Security, a study center.
Syria is “list” for refugees to re-enter, foreign affairs minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the country's conditions are improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and safer thanks to the progress achieved in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now all the conditions necessary for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to abandon due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would thank for the help he can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he said he would not accept conditional aid or countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the American team for a 16.5 to 10.5 final score at Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in European territory and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battle he offered during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in hole 16 of pair 3, losing his departure against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shone in all of his series, becoming one of only four players to achieve a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was implemented in 1979.
Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the European team's worst qualifying player Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's first ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups played, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with the most wins of the tournament, with 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry often, but I can’t help it today.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I am so happy, so happy to be able to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I am glad to have helped,” García said excited after the European victory.
He passed the testimony to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in the individual Sunday game.
“It’s amazing how proud I feel today for being able to defeat Tiger Woods. I grew up seeing that boy play,” Rahm said 23.
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
It is a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, winner of 14 majors, located only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had problems throughout the weekend not to leave the streets, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these boys, fought.
This morning, the Europeans were in trouble.
We fight.
I take off my hat to Thomas.
He is an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We will be back, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and go ahead.
I want these 12 boys and I am proud to be a captain.
It's to take off the hat.
They were superior.”
Red tide information: Concentrations are being reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the latest report by the Florida Wildlife Conservation and Fisheries Commission, a general reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay Area is occurring.
According to the aforementioned commission, increasingly uneven outcropping conditions are being observed in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which may mean that concentrations are being reduced.
The red tide extends approximately 210 km from the coast from the northern counties of Pinellas to those of southern Lee.
Concentrations of 16 km away from the coast of Hillsboroug count can be found, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Red tide was also found in Pasco County.
The presence of middle-level concentrations on the coast or far from the coast of Pinellas County last week, background and high concentrations away from the coast of Hillsborough County, background and high concentrations on or far from the coast of Sarasota's count, background and middle-level concentrations in Charlotte County, background and high concentrations in or far from the coast with Lee County, and low concentrations in the county of Lee.
In Pinellas counties, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier are informed that cases of respiratory irritation continue to occur.
No such case was reported in northwestern Florida during the past week.
