AMs from Wales fear to "be seen as foolish"
There is a constellation among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This was raised due to plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament assembly.
AMs across the political spectrum are worrying that this will make them seem ridiculous .
AM Labour said his group was concerned that "it has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In the Welsh language twp means ibleh and pwp means ratt.
Plaid's AM said the whole group ‘was unhappy and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative from Wales said his group had "open minded" about changing the name, but noted that there was a slight verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this conest the letter w in the Welsh language is pronounced similarly to the pronunciation of the letter and.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptor of what are to be called Assembly Members will naturally be a question the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government act empowered the Welsh assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that had broad support for the assembly to be called a Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the title of AMs, the Commission favored Members of the Parliament of Wales or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching a consensus may be a headache for the presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of how to call when to have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia they leave public opinion in a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was established with the aim of resolving a dispute that lasted decades with the neighbouring country Greece, which has a province of its own named Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time that the name of its northern neighbour represents .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiased over the name changes, said he will ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change simply is the consequence of the entry into the EU and NATO.
St.Martin's Bells Stop Playing as Churches in Harlem Are Sending
"Historically, the elders I spoke to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today, there is no."
He said he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People socialize differently" today.
"The bars are no longer the center of locality activity where people go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he worries that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders are thinking, "and sooner or later they will run out again where they were in the beginning."
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment blocks with condominiums filled with the type of people who will not help the rest of the locality's sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in this building would be a white carnage," he said, "and thus, they will not bother when it comes to the day they are erected for these churches because most of these people who come to live in these condominiums will not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by congregations of white-carnage people before Harlem became a metropolis of white-carnage people - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original Methodist Congregation of people of white carnage left in the 1930s.
A congregation of black carnage people practicing religion nearby took the title for the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a congregation of black carnage people under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers at 125 Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring to or promoting black carnage people.
A fire in 1939 left the building with severe damage, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and St. Martin's successor, was proud when he called the carillon "the bells of the people."
The expert who dubbed the carillon in July called it some other thing: "Cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first carillon in the world to have a black carnage musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who walked for the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him with anyone else.
What happened in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some inserted by the leaders of the lay church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The 'vestry' - the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will seek to pass on the costs" to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in firing architects and contractors who sent it from the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark hurts a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while digging for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 in the morning where Beacon's Beach at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was digging with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and then went to heal him with a group to help pull out of the water.
Hammel said he at first thought it was the thrill of after catching a lobster, but then "he realized he was shouting, ‘Gidim me!
My kid!'
He killed him and opened the whole clavicola," Hammel said he realized the moment he came where the boy.
"I shouted so everyone gets out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
Take the boy by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack was unknown.
The Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media meeting that a shark was sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic upper torso injuries.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with shelves couriers similar to those of a 'department store' of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial entry into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while the sale of clothing and items for domestic use declines, the larger corridors with beauty products will be tested at 11 stores across the country and the idea will be spread to more stores next year if it is successful.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets were looking for ways to use space on shelves that was once used for TVs, microwaves and items for domestic use.
Sainsbury's said he would double the amount of beauty items he is offering up to 3000 items, including firms such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Spreads of existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with branded areas similar to those located in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its makeup range of Boutique so that the majority of products are good for vegans - something that is increasingly being demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will examine concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, Lower London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and switching to shopping with small amounts of food every day in local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said that stores will seem increasingly like 'department stores' as the supermarket chain tries to fight against shops that discount Aldi and Lidl prices with more services and non-food produce.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos stores in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of Habitats since he bought both chains two years ago, which he says strengthened grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie ended after a fight over how to split revenues from pharmacist stores into his supermarkets.
The new strategy was entered after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skin care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of firms has been designed to suit every need and the attractive environment and convenient shop positions means that we have become a destination of beauty products of interest challenging the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'very angry' after Holly Willoughby cancels £11 million deal
Dragons' personality Den Peter Jones 'very angry' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled a £11 million deal with his lifestyle firm business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for the firm of home products and their accessories, Truly.
The pair's business has been compared to the firm of Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, appeared on Instagram in order to announce that she will be leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' personality very angry Den Peter Jones because she cancelled from being part of their business of a lucrative lifestyle firm at the last minute - to focus on her big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "very angry" when the very popular television personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his enrome business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new deals - worth up to £1.5 million - meant that it wasn't enough time left to dedicate it to their firm of home products and accessories, Truly.
The business has been compared to the firm of Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was believed to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that she would be leaving with Truly, Jones left Britain and went to one of his private travellers.
A source said: "Truly was by far Holly's first priority.
It would be her long-term future that would fill her the next few decades.
Her decision to leave left everyone completely amazed.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch had almost come.
There is a store full of its produce at Marlow's headquarters that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of presenter This Morning, who is among Britain's personalities to bring a profit, could mean a cost of millions for the company due to a large investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and the potential for further delays until its launch.
And it can mean an end to a long friendship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been well friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, entered with them as chairman chairman in March.
Couples travel together and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become an ambastric of M&S's firm and will succeed Ant McPartlin as presenter of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Yesterday evening, a source close to Jones said "We don't comment on his economic affairs."
Hard meeting 'but then we found love'
He joked about criticism that he would earn from the news media for making a comment that some people consider "non-presidential" and for being so positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump surrender so much?
Trump said with a voice imitating that of a "news presenter".
"I have not given up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump boasted that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
But denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders, on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea does not see a "correspondent response" from the United States to the early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his manifestation speech.
He said, "We are walking well with North Korea".
"We were going to enter a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this very good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results - ending rocket tests, aiding the release of hostages and returning American veterans who had stayed back home.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be a presidential, but instead of getting 10,000 people out who are trying to get into this people-filled arena, we would have had about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroying an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they were unnecessary.
Even after more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to move from their home, no national disasters were declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not requesting international assistance, thus challenging it," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether a foreign staff can operate on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, the national disaster agency's spokesman, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Considering the earthquakes that occur in Indonesia often, the country is not yet well prepared for the great anger of nature.
While shelters from tsunamis were built in Aceh, they are poorly sighted along the coast.
The seeming failure of a tsunami warning sire in Palu, despite issuing a warning, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At best times, travel between Indonesia's numerous islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was stationed in Lombok for the care of the victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive on the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the infrastructure upgrade falling pieces of Indonesia, the center of his election campaign, and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration sent over the lack of funds as he faces his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions still in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from their home as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the street, using 'machetes', bows and arrows and other types of weapons.

The ball is far above the box as it finished entering the top right side of the net.
Eventually, the ball went down after Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped in an attempt to welcome, and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get into that position, to get in for the ball and players like Shaq always send it forward as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming over me and I missed the ball once and didn't think about it much and I tried to shoot the ball."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 by mid-game after bringing 'goal' in the 25th minute by Belgian very good player Eden Hazard.
Chelsea's striker split the ballum back to Mateo Kovacic, before leaving to run to the middle of the umpire and then quickly entering Liverpool's half.

Number of deaths in Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami rose to 832, said the country's disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people have been reported trapped under the debris of the building which collapsed due to the 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves as high as 20 feet, said a spokesman from the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 people, was full of rubble from the collapsed building.

Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the argument about 'rewriting history'
Its removal would be a form of justice proper to destruction in a manner similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the English religious and cultural artifacts performed by his fanatical 'Puritan' followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "grown" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about removing statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The 'iconoclasm' of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's outstanding portrayal of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure who is recognized to represent one side of that divide.
His achievements as ‘Lord Protector' also deserve to be celebrated and comemorized."
Killing Slavery Attacks and Kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with cut artery, covered with blood near a fold in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in ‘hoggery’ on 30 May 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
Allegedly, he travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to the pig's fold in the nearby open.
He said that there was a pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"Hawks cousins were bloody and mutilated," said the cousin, who referred to him with his surname "Wu," as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up not to attack anyone else, while police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Despite being rare, cases of pigs attacking people have previously been recorded.
in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man ended up critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until she expelled his wife's animal.
After a farmer's pigs from Oregon attacked and ate it in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but blood tasting can act as a "cause."
"They would be playing.
They bite, they are very curious ... they don't intend to hurt you.
Only you must show them the proper amount of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains will bring widespread heavy rains in the southeastern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves on the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rains across northern Mexico and the southeastern United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought a wind of 85 mph, a Category 1 Hurricane, at 5 a.m. east time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles in the southwest direction of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a 'trough' over the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa is approaching the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to push strong tropical humidity in a northerly direction southwest of the United States
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, a tropical humidity interacting with the approaching ‘trough' creates heavy rainfall spread in the south-east in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, debris flows and a possible landslide in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to near 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially on a large portion of Arizona.
Quick flooding is possible with conditions rapidly deteriorating due to the scattered character of tropical rain.
It would be a good idea nothing to go out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause “canyons” to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring winds that blow a lot local and dusty.
The ‘trough' will bring some rainfall to parts of California's southern coast.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which can cause small streams of debris and slipping roads.
It would be the region's first rainfall of their rainy season.
Some floodplains of scattered tropical rain begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered late Monday and Tuesday.
A strong rain spreads into Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there may be some sharp temperature changes across the United States as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a great example of dramatic temperature differences from the U.S. Centre on Sunday.
There is almost a temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will attempt to develop and expand again.
A large piece of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures in the 80s spread from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could rise up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, being roughly 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast is pointing to high possibilities for above average temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million people saw Thursday's extremely interesting testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of committing a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political struggle continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with the shocking last minute news of Friday: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it is certain 100 percent that Kavanaugh babasha when he was under the influence of alcohol and tried to remove her clothes when they were a post-secondary school level festivities.
Kavanaugh, in passionate testimony, said that he's 100 percent sure that this didn't happen.
It is likely that over 20.4 million people reported from Nielsen on Friday saw it.
the company was counting the average amount of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds difficulty in calculating how many viewers there are from offices.
To put this in perspective, it is an audience size similar to that for the decisive football game or to the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted a whole day, Nielsen said.
ABC was just behind it with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office released a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, protesters were caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and were shouting with him as he attempted to board in the elevator for a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He remained there standing with his eyes looking down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, in a live broadcast on CNN.
"Stop standing here before you I am," said a woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to a country?
They said to him "we have power when many women have nothing.""
Flake said that his office issued a declaration and said, before the doors of the lift were closed, that he is going to have more to say in the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were broadcasting live, hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate in full for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee the following week, which Democratic minorities have long advocated.
Flake was convinced in part of conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and numerous senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power, because it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "taking advantage of politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union that they are "taking advantage" of the policy and weaken their national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May came to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview after one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former minister for foreign affairs Boris Johnson pressed his attack of the so-called 'Chequers' Plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "completely drawn."
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting who killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his spectacle during the fight.

His bond was set at $350,000, Advocate reports.
The coroner's office of East Baton Rouge Parish he released a preliminary report on Friday, which said the cause of death is damage from a gun from head to neck.
The department is giving credit to the Louisiana State Police clandestine task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and area citizens to assist with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for " diligence and seeking justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker who was 2 metres tall, was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 'rebounds' per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team is located "lost" and "under shock" after Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about him all the time," said Wade.
Vulkan throws ash on Mexico city
Ash being disposed of by the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern outskirts of Mexico's capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Messicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring several sounds and tectonic shifts.
Pictures on social media showed thin ash layers lining car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geography physicists noted increased activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The well-known "Don Goyo" volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clash with separatists from Catalonia before anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-riot police, and as thousands joined with rivalry demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization vote on secession.
A covertly pro-separatist group held back by anti-riot police threw them eggs and powder paint, creating a cloud of dark dust on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There was also minor fighting during the day and police had to use lembubes to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, pro-independence groups were making him "Don't forget, don't apologize" fought against raiding unionist protesters, "Spain Forever."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries they received in the protests, local press reported.
Tensions have remained high in the region wanting independence one year after the October 1 referendum considered illegal by Madrid but to be celebrated by separatists from Catalonia.
Voters chose with a large gap to become independent, although participation was low with those who are anti-secession making a big boycott against the vote.
According to Catalonia authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said that he was no longer hopeful in the prospects of Catalonia achieving independence.
"Last year we lived one of our wonderful moments.
I saw Mom and Dad cry with joy that they could vote but now alone," he said.
Despite having a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the pro-independence parties of Catalonia are sending to maintain momentum this year with many of their best known leaders either in exile they decided themselves or in detention and are awaiting trial due to the role they played in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was caused by politicians of both sides.
"There is more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalonia leaders who are in prison before the trial from the end of last year, announced that he is going to contest in the European Parliament elections next year.
"By emerging as a candidate for the European elections it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car entered a house vigorously
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car entered more than once forcefully into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday for the crash of 19:30 BST.
Investigative inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and to the building itself.
A 'crossbow' could also have been used to shoot at the car sometime.
Menga's Goal wins a 1-0 match for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first 'goal' for Livingston won the match
Livingston, who was promoted, besieged Rangers and thus Steven Gerrard lost for only the second time in 18 games as Ibrox's 'club' coach.
Dolly Menga's ball shot made all the difference as Gary Holt's side came equal in points with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side remained unconvinced once out of its streak in the Premiership this season and next Sunday will play against Hearts, who are first and who are behind them by eight points.
Prior to that match, Rangers would play against Rapid Vienna in their playoff in the Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continue not to have a defeat in the division in six matches, with head coach Holt not yet losing a game since he came in place of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against bulky visitors
Holt's team should have long been winning before he had a 'goal', with his direct playing style causing many problems for Rangers..
Scott Robinson managed to pass but split the ball in front of the plasta, then Alan Lithgow could only distribute the ball with a wide bod after sliding down to get the ball out of the head blow from Craig Halkett near the plasta.
Those who were playing in their own umpire were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, because they knew they were to the visitors they could give them the problems in certain moments.
And that was the way the crucial 'goal' arrived.
Rangers left a 'free-kick' in and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and brought it into the rod from the centre of the box.
By that moment, Rangers were dominating possession of the ball, but they were finding the team's defence they were playing in their own tune, not penetrating, and the ‘goalkeeper' Liam Kelly had little trouble,
That style of play continued even into the second half of the match, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to welcome the ball.
Scott Pittman did not manage to find a 'goal' due to Rangers' 'goalkeeper' Allan McGregor and Lithgow shot the ball widely after splitting another Livingston player.
Ballen were constantly entering Livingston's box and were always removed from their players, while two requests for 'penalty' - following Halkett's attempt on substitute Glenn Middleton, and another after the ball was touched by a player's hand - were rejected.
Phenomenals' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland inside the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, they continued to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
The style of play and their staff have not changed much from return to the main fight, but the most credit should go to Holt for the way he has tied the team since he arrived.
He had many heroes.
The chief Halkett was very large at his games, organizing an immensely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall with seven eyes.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain moments under Gerrard, there was a lack of standards well this time.
Their last opportunity with the ball was not good - only once did they manage to divide the team's defence that was playing in his own umpire - and it's a sign for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) there were people laughing and a blue sky as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - with the aim of repairing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from being gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters have emerged nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurdish - also mentioned their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome in the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero to certain German Turks and believed to be 'autocrat' from others.
Road collision in Deptford: Cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist died in a crash involving a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, for the crash of 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended the paramedics, but the man died on the spot.
This crash happened a few months after another cyclist died after hitting a car and went on to Childers Street, about a mile away from last Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers are injured in disorder
Six prison officials were injured after a disturbance in a high-security men's prison, said by the Prison Office.
The disorder began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire for the crash of the 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers were brought in to address the disturbance, involving eight prisoners and located in one of the sections.
The officers were given treatment for minor injuries to their face on the spot.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "A specially trained prison staff has been deployed to address an on-going incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were given care for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we will be clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of those who committed the most dangerous crimes in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital care after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year anti-riot officials were called to the prison to address a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with 'pool' balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake city with Quick Floods (Drought Areas may Benefit)
A tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but this will likely occur early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves from the southwest of the Desert, leading to rapid flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already established a quick flood watch for Monday and Tuesday to from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line off Phoenix on Tuesday, and approaches late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service Phoenix noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status at a distance of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950"!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 40 miles from AZ's border."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other southwestern areas of the Desert including the central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to have from an inch to 2 inches, with possible isolated totals up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, Rosa's rainfall may be positive as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the southwest side is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to drought monitoring devices, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category," reported from Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's route was led to touch Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which will still be a very strong hurricane Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific and therefore loses power.
Thus, it is expected to touch Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be severe, creating a significant flood risk.
"A total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of up to 10 inches," reported from Weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, and then moving through Arizona and south of Utah until late evening on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its ruins is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and in the southwestern United States desert," they said from the National Hurricanes Center.
This rain is expected to produce life-threatening rapid flooding and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Middlesomer Norton: Four arrested after attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old teenage boy was found with wounds from a knife in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, for the 04:00 BST crash on Saturday.
They took him to the hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, said Somerset Police.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have some video pulled from the mobile phone of what happened to speak.
Trump said that Kavanaugh 'sold the greens and angers' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a manifestation in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh 'sent the greens and angers' of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and with emotion denied an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about its allegation.
Saturday, the President said that, on that day, the "American people saw the bravery and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with an impeccable public service record", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We find five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't contest, but in truth, I'm contesting," he said.
"Therefore I am running everywhere fighting for very good candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first major procedural vote inside the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than on Friday, said senior assistant of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Hundreds have been killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with the number of deaths seemingly increasing
At least 384 people have been killed, many have been killed as huge waves came down forcefully on beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six metres (18 ft) came down forcefully on the ground when it began to darken, while many crashed and died and destroyed everything that was in the middle.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5-power earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not rise to happen immediately and ended up victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami has not emerged on its own, drew cars, logs, houses, struck everything that was there on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and stores destroyed, bridges that surrounded themselves and fell and a mosque surrounded by water.
Strong shocks kept driving the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in the statement that the energy emitted by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said the town's geography, which is on the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "expensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centers and hotels had fallen.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of a collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that casualties and damage may be larger along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally sent and uninformed" by Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there," they said from the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami struck Palu, although officials said the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In a shared amateur video on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting warnings with tsunami anxiety approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes an enormous amount of water came down forcefully on the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the videos immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused heavy light cuts that reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths far exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived strong and full in the city of Palu, where employees are taking refuge came armed tarpoline shelters in their office courtyard, they passed through where scenes of devastation on their way there, Mr Doseba said.
He said, "He said to me that they saw many houses that were destroyed".
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups began the unpleasant disaster relief process, few of them complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep competencies were not being allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start entering if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we can introduce international assistance but so far there is no status."
With the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing were still hoping their loved ones would have been the miracles to embellish this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy emerged through a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was trapped under the rubble for two days near her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national Paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Others of those captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a superior person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional weight," he said.
Mr Gendon recounted how, in the hours after the news that fell the Roa Roa Hotel circulated among the paragliding community, he sent desperately, messages with WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only marked that they left, but did not mark that they arrived.
"I think that's what it means that the messages haven't arrived," he said.
Halleins take $26,750 while ATM was being replenished in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was replenishing an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was battling an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While occupied with his work, another man "came to run from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rap singer changes his name to Ye
The rap singer Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the Twitter change on Saturday, he said: "The man who was previously known as Kanye West"
West, 41, was vacated Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the program who cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the creator of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" said West earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So am I, you, I am we, she is, we are.
From Kanye meaning 'the only one', to Ye only - simply a reflection of what we have right, wrong, what confuses us, everything.
The album is more reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rap singers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that it prefers the names Love and Love's Brother.
As one who used to collaborate with West, JAY-Z, he is also served with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that he "will never use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
The troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double funds for I.A.
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount they spend on research in this area, says the investor and practitioner of IA Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made announcements of the IA, even though there is a lack of formal IA strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it is aiming to be the first in IA innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for IA research would be a good start, as all other countries are much more backward than the United States, and we are looking for the next revolutionary step in the IA," Lee said.
The doubling of funds may double the possibilities that the next major IA achievement will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent IA companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that won the highest ranking player of American Othello, after which he was executive with Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government competitions in technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when it will be the next one, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee said researchers in the United States often have to work hard in order to get grants from the government.
Lee said, "It is not China that is removing academic leaders; the corporators are doing so,".
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have employed people who inspire others from universities to work on IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen their efforts at the IA.
He said, "I believe the green card should be offered automatically to people who have a PhD in the IA".
The State Council of China released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funds to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations issue money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Further this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative named AI Next.
Regarding NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in IA research.
Meanwhile, US legislation that attempted to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence saw no action in several months.
The Macedonian people vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to a "Republic of North Macedonia," a step that resolves a dispute that has been going on for decades with Greece that had blocked its membership offers for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of the happened in its north represents a possibility of possession of its territory and vetoed on its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavian majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the turnout will reach the minimum of 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote is read: "You are in favour of membership in NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter into bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that is emerging from the Yugoslavia collapse.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the result of voting to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country that gives him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was arming a small stage and preparing seats in front of the tents armed by those who would make a boycott of the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we have to enter proudly under our conditions, not by commanding others" said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others such as China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that membership in NATO is going to bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the great majority is going to be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after voting.
He said that a result in favor of changing the name would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum - an amount below that of the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, participation must be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it represents the first serious blow to government policy in favor of Western ideologies from the moment it took control in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, passes from all Brighton defence to 'goal'
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made that his 'goal' in the 65th minute seemed very easy.
The striker from Argentina received a ball from midfield at the start of the sequence.
It ran from between three Brighton defenders before it ran into an open-air space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green vests.
He fought with one defender before escaping from much more with the edge of Brighton's box.
He then split the ball on his left and found Sterling.
The English striker touched the ball for the first time in the box to redistribute Aguero, who used the right foot to insert the ball into the right side of the net by passing it from where Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero is sending me with some problems at his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about the fact that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We had the luck he made 'goal' at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the Premier League fight.
That 'goal' occurred in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball heavily inward into Brighton territory in that action.
He sent the ball right to Leroy Sane with the left side in a nice way.
Sane touched the ball sometime before leading Sterling where the rode.
The Sky Blues striker touched the ball slightly and inserted it into the net just before sliding into territory that is not supposed to enter it.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in a spoiler vs. Rockies
As Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the decisive match, there was no reason to make an effort to restart.
But the player so competitive Scherzer hopes he can be the ‘pitcher' on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which are ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with a single game.
The Rockies managed to get a possibility to continue competing with a 5-2 win against the Nationals Friday evening, but are still seeking to gain a first division title.
"Despite playing for nothing, at least we can have the possibility of winning by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I would be able to face this year.
What wouldn't you want to compete in those circumstances?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to let Scherzer be the ‘pitcher' in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting for the 34th time, held a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a pitcher on Sunday when he is generally resting.
The player from Washington who plays with his right hand is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 'strikeout' in 220 2/3 'innings' in this season.
Trump's manifestations in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation relating to the choice for his Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November, everything we did will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very great -- I do not contest, but in truth, I am contesting so I am running everywhere fighting for very good candidates," he said.
"We're seeing this very horrible and radical group of Democrats, we're seeing it happen now," Trump continued.
And they are determined to take back power by using every means possible, you can see the green.
They do not care who they hurt, whoever they want to fly in order to gain power and control, what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
He said that Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And I've seen it along these last four days," he said, and was calling the Democrats "enraged and green and nasty and dishonest."
He referred to the ranked Democratic Senator in the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein with her name, and received much negative shout from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you issued the Document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I expect, first of all—the movements of her body were nothing positive—the worst movements I have ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad group.
It does not tolerate those who communicate their opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I didn't take it overwhelmingly.
After all, I'm the most recent MP in a list of Labour Party MPs that was not welcome - because we communicated our opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she fought antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the Friday evening General Council were exactly so.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more merciful and gentle" policy has long been forgotten if, in fact, it has ever begun in truth.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This started soon after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political understanding began to expect to change my mind and take positions I never agreed to in other situations - whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and, in truth, it doesn't make any difference to say - they happen after me with abuse on social media with a request to remove me from my MP post, denounce the politics of the centre, and tell me that I do not have a part of the Labour Party.
And that is not just my experience.
Yes, I know that I have had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily face a lot of sexual or racist abuse but never hide from the comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that abuse levels have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with every motion of "lack of confidence" or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes narrower.
I have been given a lot of advice over the last two years that encouraged me to keep my opinions for me, not to be so vocal and then everything "would be well."
But I didn't go into politics to do so.
Ever since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the negligence of Thatcher's government which left my comprehensive school class literally in a disastrous state, I have sought to improve public services for those who need them most - both as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, even in the election that passed.
No one in Nottingham East could have been, in any way, confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I say is that when the country is moving towards Brexit that is going to harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in truth, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to work for you and promise you that no amount of threats that remove me from my post or of political expediency will discourage me from acting in those I believe are all your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, who have not lost once yet, climb on top in the rankings
Two attempts could slightly alter the result, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this game of the day so thriller of the Tennent's Premiership.
They are currently first in the rankings, the only team out of all ten who have not lost once.
Ultimately, it was the superior defense, as well as their ability to profit from opportunities, which helped the team, who was playing in his own umpire, wins, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've been out of trial during our matches so far, and we've not lost one, so I'm happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "We give credit to Ayr, they have profited from the better opportunities than we are."
With Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, but, a yellow card from Scotland's head Rory Hughes, who was left to play the match by the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's victory with 'penalty', before, in the middle of the exact match, he made a 'goal' and converted an individual attempt to get points 17-5 to Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted from Baggot, reduced the gap by 5 points.
He then stopped the match due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who came out of the pool on a stretcher, and upon restarting the match, Ayr continued to take points after an attempt by Stafford McDowall, converted from Climo.
Then, Ayr's chief agent Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and once more, Melrose emerged with aggression when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of hard pressure.
However, the team that was playing in its own pool resumed attacking, and when given a yellow Struan Hutchinson card for action that made it on Climo without the ball, from the 'penalty' line, MacPherson touched the ball to the ground at the back of Ayr's advancing group.
Climo converted, as he did once more almost from the area from which the match would resume, after Kyle Rowe collected the ball which met David Armstrong through the box and sent Gregor Henry, who plays with the side, for the fifth try of the side she was playing in her own lap.
Still Game's personality appears ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game Ford Kieran's personality appears willing to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man who does the part of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC programme, which he writes and takes part in with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the final one of the programme, and it appears that Kiernan plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to official registry lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was looking to get involved in Glasgow's "very well-performing restaurant trade".
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, who is surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen a passage to the Pacific
The sailors stand a naval headquarters patrol armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
A public building bears an ocean-coloured blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: "The sea is ours rightfully.
Recovering it is a duty."
Across all of Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the lost coast to Chile in a bloody conflict of 19th century resources is still clear - as soon as the desire for Bolivians to be able to sail in the Pacific Ocean once more.
That hope is perhaps at its peak in decades, since Bolivia awaits a decision by the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive thought," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ's decision on large screens all over the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find, in favor of Bolivia's claim, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year - also has much to lose in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to getting access to the Pacific Ocean again," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would rule in Bolivia's favor - and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant the territory of Chile, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ judgment arrives only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case "was not complicated" said Paz Zárate, an expert from Chile in international law.
And far from being favored the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may not have been helpful.
"The issue of access to the sea was seized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' hostile rhetoric weakened any residual goodwill of Chile, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile, at some point, will continue to speak, but it would be very difficult to hold discussions after that.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an "extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the "opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular Latin American presidents - was using the maritime issue as political aid.
" Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the United States
North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons is the first if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri had spoken on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to deliver on the promises they made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rivals.
Passes his comments as the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy that is stagnated more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "hope in the void" that continuing sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is concerned about whether to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang making significant first steps of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious at relinquishing an armament that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Trump's second summit.
Paris' fashion shows reveal the latest collection of clothing for the massive head that will soon appear in the main stores.
If you want to add to your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you can stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of strange and very large headwear for their 2019 Spring and Summer collection on the runway that inspired the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
A very impractical kpiepel is appearing heavily on Instagram this summer and these designers flew their surprising creations on stage.
The object that stood out mostly by Valentino was an extravagant beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like edge that completely covered the heads of the models.
Other very large-sized accessories included jewel-covered watermelons, a clover hat and even pineapple - but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the coloured masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than ‘haute couture'.
One creation resembled the diving apparatus complete with snorkel and goggles, while another was like a molten ice cream cone .
And if you continue with this style—good luck.
Fashion pursuers predict that huge 'bonnets' will soon appear in the main stores.
The very large hats emerge after the exit of 'La Bomba', the two-foot wide-edged straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The "cult label" responsible for the impractical hat much seen on social media flew another big creation on stage - a straw bag that contains almost as much as the mesh model it was carrying.
The dark orange raffia basket, surrounded by small raffia twine and white leather grips, was the most spicy creation in Jacquemus's Spring and Summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I'm expecting to see big hats and sea bags in the main stores for the coming summer - since the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which is only reinforced with individual and collective success in sport, arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to give the best level of service to their students and parents..
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, for their chosen career and for their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain a topic of popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If he spoke a human being in a language he understands, he understands with his mind.
If they spoke in his own language, he understands with his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent exams, we can see that languages are leading the ranking tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved a Higher A grade.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that are members of SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a Higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German studyers, 69 percent of French studyers and 63 percent studying Spanish achieved A as well.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject option, maintained in the same regard as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that from reasons employers gave for the fact they are sending to fill vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming more and more imperative to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Irrespective of the career chosen, learning another language will have a real advantage in the future as it has the ability to stay such a life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual lead in the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and, by 15 percent, French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage.
That is why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages that they can choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot be denied at present, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be seen as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's youth.
The faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
On Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with the Lakers in San Diego
LeBron James's sports supporters weren't long waiting for him to start for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the opening game before the season starts on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes he will play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official web site.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell wrote a tweet that, likely, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
After the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the schedule of the six matches preceding the Lakers' season.
"On this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Trump's Manifestation in West Virginia, Youtube Canal
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign manifestations tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first manifestation out of five scheduled next week, including stops at amicable locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote suspended for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when ballots are cast in Nov.
At the time is Trump's manifestation in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
Trump's manifestation in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view Trump's manifestation in West Virginia online below via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump would likely address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became intense over sexual misconduct allegations with an anticipated Senate confirmation vote suspended for up to a week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary goal of this wave of manifestations is to help Republicans face the November elections to gain little momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said these five manifestations next week are aimed at "encompassing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress Control is so important to this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach the demanding campaign season," he told Reuters a spokesman for Trump's campaign refusing to name his name.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening's manifestation can gather supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media coverage of Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump will have visited West Virginia, the state that won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to boost him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. Team determined not to give up while moving to Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sport concept but one that players really believe in, and never more than in such competitions.
So where do they say they put momentum now?
"These were leading by six points and now we are by four, so I think we are carrying this as little momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points in the lead with a further twelve to be played.
The Americans, says Spieth, feel but that they have a few setbacks and have a lot to encourage them, not at least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them boast of three points out of four.
Spieth was accurate from tee to green and is leading by example.
That heartfelt outcry of celebration continued to grow as he continued his round, making a crucial putt to bring a fourth match equal when he and Thomas were two from below after two.
His putt who won the game on 15 was met by a similar cry, the kind who tells you he believes the American team is still there.
"Vera wants to go deep and worry about your own item," said Spieth.
That's what left them each of these players now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sweet couple are four with four and are considered perfect.
"Moliwood" were the only pair that did not darken a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the following nine Friday mornings.
That run, and the way their energy looks like moving both to and from this living crowd establishes that they are the players offering a challenge Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun descends on Le Gulf National from Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably the two at once over different holes.
But here we are talking about an early European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon completed by Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he was placed in pair with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front nine brought the Spanish and Swedish into a hole that never managed to get close to getting out of it.
But Sunday, there's nobody to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very awkward to see them closely because of the peer-to-peer interactions, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can be turned into a second.
Europe played better as a team so it came so far and is in the lead on the final day but this foursomes session also showed that the US Team has the determination that some, especially on the US side, were questioning.
Europe lead with 10-6 on Ryder Cup final day
Europe will take good advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after exiting the fourball parties and Saturday's foursomes in the lead with 10-6 over the United States.
The pair inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made the effort with two wins over Tiger Woods who found it difficult to take their score so far ahead at the Le Golf National for four points.
European side Thomas Bjorn, ready to keep the losing trophy at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went wrong in morning fourballs, which took the series by 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, by winning two parties, but could not come to the difference in scoring.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12 single-player punts to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season to have won four points in succession while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to have won four points from their four opening parties in Ryder Cup history.
After dominating over Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs then worked excellently to win Woods who did not appear optimistic and the new American player for the Bryson Dechambeau season with an even more empathic score of 5&4.
Woods, who found difficulty in both parties Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliance but now lost 19 of his 29 punts in fourballs and foursomes and seven in succession.
Justin Rose, rested for morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes for a 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world.
But it did not come all the way Europe wanted on a beautiful day, with a little blaze in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a big winner for three times, and Justin Thomas set the limit for the Americans by two points Saturday.
They achieved a bold 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in fourballs and returned later to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in Ryder Cup history that a team returned from a four-point difference while entering the singles, although the holders of Furyk's side need a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, a Sunday counterattack appears to be going to be more than they can do.
North Korea says that "in no way" will you unilaterally disarm without trust
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations Saturday that continuing sanctions were deepening its distrust in the United States and that there was no way the country would leave its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "considerable goodwill measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and vowing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would have been rewarded as it would have taken gradual steps, his statement appeared significantly not to have rejected unilateral denuclearization without thinking as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a U.S. president serving his duties and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea was seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to reduce tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'denuclearizing first' and increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal coercively, and even objects to the 'end-of-war declaration,'" said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can break us is a people's dream that they don't know about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions are deepening our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader emphasized at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party for this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a blockade."
Despite this, Ri's speech tone was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland ground with North Korean rockets was inevitable after the "Mr. Kative President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work remains to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timetable for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Thursday, told the UN Security Council that: "Enforcing Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without stopping until we realize fully and finally verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with the aim of stopping funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri at the margins of the UN General Assembly after which he said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already toured North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July while saying that progress was made, after North Korea criticized him within hours for making "gangster-like claims".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to disarm a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "correspondent measures."
He said that Kim had told him that the "correspondent measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students do a course on taking enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year managed to make all of its students who have not yet graduated sleep longer with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture of studying all night and remaining awake thanks to caffeine.
Academic found that students at the university in the first place in the world often don't have an idea about the true basic things about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, devised the course, believing it to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he made a speech on the impact that lacked sleep on learning.
"At last came a girl on me and she said: 'Why are they telling me this now, in my last year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the essential things about how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a student's sleeping room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell them the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance has an effect on sleep deficiency, and the importance of routine sleep time.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged insomnia can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it's not going to change students' behaviour right away.
But we believe they have a right to know - as much as you have a right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke cigarettes," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of being proud that "you managed to stay awake all night studying" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant sleeplessness was a growing problem.
Ensuring that he falls asleep enough, and of good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, severe fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid increasing weight, since sleeplessness puts the brain in a hunger mode, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist for a course across the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduating students to do a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider making an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as for when they wake up, and know about the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can imbalance your circadian rhythm, and lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal disrupts Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another period of sadness when they played abroad as Dolly Menga's strike delivered Steven Gerrard's separated side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's side were looking to make a record of their first win while travelling by the February triumphal 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Hold's team only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 punts as manager to leave his side eight points away from Ladbrokes Premiership's great leaders, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and Rangers' list of missing-inspiration players never seemed to catch up.
While Rangers now come down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and only behind Hibernian on a gull difference.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in his head after seemingly throwing an item on the part of the team's supporters who played abroad.
Gerrard made eight changes in the side that passed Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-trained form hindered their opponents constantly.
Rangers may have dominated the possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had to score just two minutes from the start when Menga's first-time play-off sent Scott Pittman to a mustache of Allan McGregor but the midfilder took his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs's strong free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defending partner Alan Lithgow could only be shot from behind.
Rangers gained control but seemed to be more hopeful than believing about their game in a third final.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he had to have a penalty on the fifteen-minute mark as he and Steven Lawless crashed but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Komobian appeals.
Rangers managed to target well only two shuts in the first half of the punt but Ibrox's previous goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely troubled him the head blow of Lassana Coulibaly and the light striker of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's first goalkeeper in the 34th minute may have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that he only deserved them for their effort.
Again, Rangers did not manage Jacobs's good set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher dried the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to select Menga to end the action.
Gerrard reacted in the brake by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided immediate impact as the winger dried up at Morelos but impressers Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston went on to draw the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they loved, with Lithgow and Halkett catching a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side were able to extend their lead position in the final stages but McGregor held well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow went openly from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late plea for a penalty as he argued with Jacobs but again Thomson looked the other side.
Almanakk: Geiger's Container's inventor
And now a page from our Almanac of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, like today's 136 years today, and WE ARE TODAY ... the day on which future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger's Container.
A science fiction foundation since then, Geiger's Containment has become a foundation of pop culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," featuring those unlikely cowboys scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Husband: "That's what the madoffi is?"
Rogers: "That's a Geiger contactor, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When wearing these cuffs, you can actually hear the effects of atoms that give radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Say, surely she's popular now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he turned 63.
But the invention by his name survives.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are converted into a laboratory
These can then "see" a protein common to many cancers and then re-injected
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, they are changed in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "driven the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and how to "taught" them how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.

This Did Not Go Good
Kanye West was bowled at the studio during Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance in which U.S. President Donald Trump praised and said he would stand for election in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, named Ghost Town in which he was wearing a beritt of Make America Great, he began saying against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white person and tell me: 'How can Trump please, what racist?'
If I were concerned about racism, I have been leaving America," he said.
SNL began the program with a comedy sketch in which Matt Damon appeared in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judicial Committee about sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it did not broadcast, West's video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to grieve you with West when he postulated him.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that they had caught up with him behind the scene about his bequest.
"Bull me behind the scenes.
He said, "don't get out there with that blessed."
Browse me!
Then they say they lost," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the loser? and went on to say that "I would wear the cap of my superman, because that means you cannot tell me what I do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments triggered a bowling at least twice by the audience and SNL cast members seemed embarrassed, reported Varety, with one person there telling the publication: "At all the studio a great silence has fallen."
West brought him as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend she had, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West confounded many with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed as Perrier's Bottle.
West had support from the president of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the boldest spirits: GRAZZES FOR LOOKING TO THE FOLLA."
But presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West simply was "what is and this is something beautiful-mens."
"But I have not chosen to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
So much else we are," she added.
Prior to the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the former known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The previous rapper, Snoop Dogg bore the name Snoop Lion and of course the legend of music that is no longer with us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted knife-bump murder at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of an attendance of murder after a man was given knife blows at a restaurant in East Belfast Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before Belfast Magistrates' Court Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington speaks of the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role in singing the sword as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, aged 31, spoke of the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on-screen mean that young men often feel they have to be violent to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that "something has gone wrong" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star of Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, aged 31 as well, admitted to having "strong interests" to address the issue.
"Personally, do I feel I have a strong interest, currently - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?," he said.
"What were we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through its very male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, which makes young men feel they want to be this certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that?
For it is very clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he will not make prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that "so many wars and horses".
From November Kit will appear in Sam Shepard's new production True West which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently the actor revealed that he considers that when he met his wife Rose it was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I have met my wife on this program, then that way he gave me my future family, and my life from here on," he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series she won in the Emmy.
The couple were married in June 2018 at the land of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, say health officials.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been rapidly spreading in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way had been reduced to nearly zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China increased by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV by sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be common.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70.9% of men having sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member revealed data of GOP senators, saying "a dangerous lie" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles ascertained that the claims were being spread by pundites and "ultra right side" websites.
"Gides, lies and more lies worth esteeming," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, postulated by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate board hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure was made some time after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the locations was associated with Waters' office and released the information of a Waters staff member, reported the Hill.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from White House's former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is one of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests it does not have the temperament to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
It shall not be resistant.
He shall not question the accuser's motives.
It must be calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will stand to take the Waters seat in the mid-term elections, also mentioned his voice on Twitter.
"This is something great if it's true," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned the "appropriate law enforcement authorities and entities about these fraudulent claims.
"We'll make sure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they'll be kept legally repsonable for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to each and all members of my staff."
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Against - Rowan Atkinson, imitation of a powerless spy
It has become traditional now to seek Brexit meanings in any new film with a British perspective and this seems applicable to the return of Johnny English's action-comedy imitation franchise - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and re-lived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Would ironic autosatira on the subject of how bad we are of course, be the opportunity of a new export of the country?
At any rate, the incompetent Johnny English with great eyes and parts in his face moving unusually had the licence renewed for the second time to do everything wrong - that his name more than anything else proves to be a widespread comic creation designed for territories of people going to cinema who do not speak English.
Naturally he is the stupid secret agent who despite his strange claims to his sweet fascination has little from Clouseau, a hit of Mr. Bean and a large piece of that man who contributed one note to the melody of the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international husband of a mystery whom Atkinson had once done his part in Barclaycard TV's advertisements, today forgotten, after leaving chaos behind.
There is a nice moment or two in this last issue of JE.
I liked the moment when Johnny English was approaching an helicopter while he was wearing medieval armoured clothing and propeller blades clashed with his helmet for a short while.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy appears, but humor is felt rather poor and extra strangely, especially since the film's "serious" brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer the comedy as a confident ingredient.
Humor is felt as if aimed at children rather than adults, and for me the strange unfortunate incidents of Johnny English were not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's wordless film jokes in Bean's persona.
The perennial topical proposition is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's very secret web network of spies, exposing the identities of all of Britain's agents in the field, to the agent's disappointment that he was on duty - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is cherry on the cake for the prime minister who is an imperious and difficult figure, already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character looks like Teresa May but there is not much in the script to work.
Its intelligence advisers inform it that every active spy has been compromised, it will have to bring someone out of retirement.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an elegant building, but gives unofficial lessons on how to become an infiltrated operative: a few good jokes here as English offers a School of Rock type spying academia.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his former very patient partner, Bough, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, with a submarine commander, a role of one smelled interpreted by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is slightly wasted.
So the two inseparable who always confuse everything in her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, when they encounter the character of a seducent and beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the rule of the billionaire of sweet technology which claims that he can solve Britain's computer problems: minister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of fun-fare behavior: dressed as waiters, setting fire to a high French restaurant, creating chaos to climb up on Volta's luxury yot; and English begins a complete anarchy as he tries to use cuffies of Virtual Reality to familiarize himself with Volta's house interior.
Certainly all stops lead to that last sequence, but as amicable and animated as it is, it has little idea of child television.
Something rather moderate.
And like Johnny English's other films I couldn't but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role he really deserves for his talent?
The Labour denies that they are preparing a plan for the British to work a week of four days but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see the British running a four-day week - but being paid for five.
Allegedly the party wants the company impeachment to pass the remnant that is done by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them another day a save.
This would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would still take the same pay with them.
Sources have said that the idea would be "broken" with the party's economic agenda and plans that the country would shift in favour of workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A superior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It's not going to happen overnight but a four-day working week is an aspiration that suits the party's approach to rebalance the labour-friendly economy as well as the party's global industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the aspiration is currently not being approved by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "the profiters" at utility firms.
Opposition chancellor plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies might not take back their entire share as a Labour government could make a "reduction" based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to donate 10 percent of private sector firms' equity to employees, willing to take annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's FBI investigation can change their minds
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by a week, raising the question as to whether the bureau's findings could influence any Republican senator from withdrawing his support.
In an interview she broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Here, and sure," said Kennedy.
"I said as I entered the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after that allegation was issued, I said, "Have you done it?"
He was resolute, determined, inequovic."
Graham's vote, however, seems difficult to change.
"I have already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and wants to be a very big charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And every person you mention can't verify it.
It is 36 years old.
I have not seen anything new change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Did Something to Reduce Poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a very impressive list of stars that will appear and an equally impressive mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people release it to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a representation group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay a VIP ticket), those going to the concert had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or some other significant ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful did the Global Citizen with 12 years remaining to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to ask for a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - do people feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
As of 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered over 19 million "actions" by its supporters, which I insisted for a number of different goals.
It says these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are equivalent to over $37 billion expected to affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that secure funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the dia.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," with the promise of providing Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweet from Global Citizens.
"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of denutrition a footnote in history," said the embassy of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman to the crowd during a direct concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after over 5,000 actions were taken to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on his website asking "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It's going to be a long and hard trip - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we'll succeed, because we have more power when we're together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, who will present him with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. uses Navy for "block" to thwart Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, unveiled U.S. Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it is operating with a legitimate government invitation - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern side of Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not reached the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that styled itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that these are effectively the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is, more or less, the leverage and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "someone with one skill" with an economy relying on carbureted fuels.
The statements come as Trump's administration was on a mission to strengthen the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to pull out of the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 gasduct project, which according to Trump, made Berlin the "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow stressed for many times that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gasduct, which is expected to double the capacity of the existing gasduct to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, reaffirming its commitment to the project.
Germany's main organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), invited the United States beix to stay away from Europe's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Ser "Sew Examining" Whether to Get Out for a President in 2020, Says Senator of Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Saturday said she will "examine us well" whether to stand for president after the mid-term elections.
At a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she considers getting out.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our devastated government and this includes a woman in the highest position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will examine whether I go out for a president."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the council meeting, saying that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was directed in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "naturally we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a poll released Thursday, showed that a majority of Waren's own constituents do not think she should run out for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand for election, according to the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Center polls.
Thirty-two percent supported the issue for election.
The poll showed more support for the run-off for election than previous Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting for a potential election run-off and 48 percent against him.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed regarding a potential outage for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he officially decides by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin refers to the PTSD of Palin Track in Donald Trump's manifestation
A 26-year-old Palin track spent a year in Iraq after being recorded in September
He was arrested and brought on a domestic violence incident on the night of Monday
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returned, I can relate to other families who feel the ramifications of the PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with," she told the audience in a manifestation for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest as "the obvious problem that nobody is addressing" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they return a little different, return stronger, return stronger, think if there is that respect for what other soldiers like them and air personnel, and every other member of the military, has given the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was brought on a domestic violence attack on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support a challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. Ishati policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district, Friday brought a court friend's case to Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, reported NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace's case against Sessions that brought the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and the boys members of his violent gang," abused her but US officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was kept in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, producing a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as nations are facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Board of Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Friday, in a statement, the District Attorney General of Columbia Karl Racine, said that the new policy "ignors decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a motive violates this principle, saying the case of a court friend.
Lawyers continued to argue in the event that the policy of denying income to immigrants would harm the U.S. economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop giving asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in a time fight to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly terrible.
"It was felt very intense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while embracing her baby son with fever at an evacuation centre in the unfortunate city of Palu.
"Every ambulance minute brings the bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching in their water-scathed affairs, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overfilled.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures in his back and shoulder, remained outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to continued strong shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recounted that he felt the violent earthquake moved the hotel floor on the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
"There was no chance to save ourselves.
I crushed with the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in place for a wedding.
"I heard my wife shouting for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week later an official Chinese newspaper issued a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper that comes out a day trying to sell the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the newspaper that is sold mostly in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 United States congressional elections, accused China of denying it.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters it was a new phase in a campaign escalating from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a rising trade war that has seen them pass tariff rounds on the imports of each.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and Iowa's long-time former governor, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion page in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now doubling this bullying by making propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the government of China is using America's dear tradition of free expression and free press by placing a paid advert in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, on the newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you'll find limited dispersal voices and you're not going to see a true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people can have about China's problematic economic trajectory, since the media is found under a restriction of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Are Aliening Women Voters Before the Mid-Term Elections with the Kavanaugh Debate, Warning Analysts
As many top Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while facing several sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that they will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the next mid-term elections.
Emotions about this were very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to run by vote.
These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm out angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C..
Friday morning, the protesters sang "November comes!" as they protested in the Senate hall as Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run with Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst to the news site.
"People are saying they were already high; and true.
"But they may be higher, particularly between female voters who switch ballots in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who while they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that it could pursue an adverse reaction if Republicans run with confirmation.
"This has become a complete confusion for the GOP," said Michael Steele, the previous chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This does not only concern the committee's vote or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh would be put on the bench, it also concerns the way Republicans managed this situation and how they handled it," indicated news station Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that would help elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somehow divided over believers in light of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents believed definitely or probably Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they believed definitely or probably Ford's statement.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations put forward by Ford as well as at least another actress, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh while he was a xurban attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while in festivities when studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The Inventor of the World Wide Web plans to Start a New Internet to Compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business seeking to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We want to do it now," he said of the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their "personal online data shop" or POD.
This may contain contact lists, lists of what to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify have all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes the online data store unique is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal autonomization through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company brings appropriate resources, process skills and skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought by IBM, some developers in staff who have a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications through the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We are not asking their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid.'
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of influence in the net neutrality debate.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am immensely optimistic for this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebrated cleric of the Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only cleric of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
The Lt Kur Il-Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he won the highest British military honour.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said that it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was to be unveiled exactly 100 years after the achievement of his grandfather's prize winning.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the Lt Kur delivered its battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in much fog and fire from field guns and machine guns."
Later he hurried to the line of fire and with the "greatest courage" led the line forward before going to a rifle on site alone and losing unconscious three of the trump.
The Lt Kur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never get there but something very humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a girlanda after the parade, which was led by Brentwood's Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "feeling very honoured to have played a role in this parade" and added "the courage of a genuine hero was being shown by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA supporters remained awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead ending with Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you would have stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206 packed to end up denied seeing the main event.
The list from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were being shown direct overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK remained amazed when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had remained awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
One party on Twitter described the switch to children's cardboard as "some kind of bulky joke."
"It is government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate therefore they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, superior vice president of Bellator's marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Belator chairman Scott Coker said they will work on scheduling them to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think that when I think about repetition, we can probably fix something," said Coker.
"But currently there they are six on Sunday mornings and we will not be able to arrange until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
Emmint me, when the broadcast was switched there were a lot of messages going on and not all were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a governmental issue.
I can promise you that the next time will not happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to lead more to supporters and instead we have gone too far.
It is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old man said he had not realized until he went to the secondary that "not everyone like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke of gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent he became less concerned than winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
While appearing as a discarded person on Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "less than" anyone else's growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to please boys and girls."
He said: "To date, those emotions that feel less than, and feel different, were the true things that gave me the power and strength that I could succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was "something", he said, not to disappoint everyone when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
Olympic bronze medallist for twice became a high-profile promoter for LGBT and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt fortunate that he could live freely without ramifications and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world winner for three times said that when he came to love a man - a US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was a surprise" for him.
Daley married the winner of the Oscar, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said that the age gap was never a problem.
"When you go through so many things at such a young age - he went to his first 14-year-old Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar nice and sad experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, for me the important thing was that ‘I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the things he had asked was if they already had the tickets for London 2012 - since he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, pà'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and it was dead that I finally acknowledged he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that this was what I dreamed all my life - to dive in front of a crowd from countries at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired his first song selection - Heather Small's Proud - which was compatible with him in the move to the Olympics and still ignites the bard.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson who is no longer in form remains on the bench at the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to change his form to avoid being an important not so cheerful stage.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for a record of 12 times, remained on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being the centre of action, as it was many times for the United States, the big five-time winner crossed his day between supporting and working on his game from the distance in hopes of rectifying what to worry about.
One who has never been giving the ball right even in the fullness of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for Le Golf National's difficult track, where the rough long distance repeatedly punishes mistaken shuts.
And if the course alone isn't heartbreaking enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces the precise champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, new to the season, to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, by four points less than the start of the 12th single game, start well, Mickelson's game could prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he played today, tapping on my back and putting his arm around me and saying he'll be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"We have a lot of confidence in itself.
He is Hall of Famer and has contributed much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two parties.
I saw more, but that's the way it worked and that's the way we thought it'll go.
He wants to be there outside, like anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup parties played Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that quite never reached the fillies of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said that his presence brought little intangible things to the team.
"He laughs, sarcastic, humorous, loves to laugh at people, and a very good man you have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players have enjoyed criticizing him, this week, which was something fun to see.
It provides a lot more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn whose big front position can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizable front position before the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup could easily turn into a uncomfortable journey.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros retained a five-point advantage over the Americans but ended with a narrow true margin barring, with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
"It keeps reminding yourself that we had a great front position in Valderrama; we had a great front position in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with little," said Bjorn, in the press, after seeing the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to be on service with 10-6 at the Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone in this yet-unfinished team.
Tomorrow you go with your soul and body.
Take out there and do all things right.
It hasn't finished everything yet until you have brought the points on the team.
We have a goal, and what we try to hide this trophy, and the focus will remain there.
I have always said, I focus on the 12 players who are in our side, but we know well what the other side is - the biggest players in the world."
Contempt with how his players played on a difficult golf track, Bjorn added: "I never go an oltrè pass from me at this.
Tomorrow a different challenge.
Tomorrow concerns the individual performances we see, and this is something different to do.
Very welcome to be there outside with a partner when things are going well, but when you are there outside individually, you will then be tested for your full ability as a golfer.
This is the message you want to pass on to players, who come out your best tomorrow.
Now, leave the partner behind you and he wants to leave and get out his best, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who acquired three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those last days who could change everything, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before finishing a loser as Europe made the "Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember to the least word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important items, but you would like to abduct it to that quick beginning as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medinah.
When that one-sided momentum arrives, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle parties.
We have drawn up our list properly and put those men in the way we felt, you know, we are trying to do a few miracles tomorrow."
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and face Roy McIlroy in the best match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of men this way because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's new war postponed once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the frigates of the aging Cold War time, but there will not be until at least next year due to systems with defects and rising cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the new flaming brigade of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a spokesman for the military.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but problematic post-delivery issues stained the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that ordered the Navy back in 2007 will come as a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a strong cannon, an anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile display as well as some cautious technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic singers.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - this should be possible to operate the newest frigates up to two years away from home ports.
However, a continuous delay means that the last technology vessels – which said they allow Germany to project power overseas – will already be old until the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 frigate of bad misfortune appeared in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard at Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a vessel to a shipbuilder after delivering.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that made the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The defects in the software were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workers on the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appeared that the ship is heavily overweight to reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is understood to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
This is said to have reached a shocking amount of €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - out of an initial €2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest fraggates become especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy currently "has a shortage of vessels to withstand deployment."
The official said the problem grew over time, because old ships were commissioned but replacement vessels were not provided.
He complained that none of the brigade-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is mentioned on the bat's secret life
New research being conducted in land in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when searching for food.
It is hoped that the findings will show new light on the behavior of unique mammals that fly and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pipistrelles and soprano as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in major localities around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of bat calls and which species is doing what.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be produced which will create a detailed picture of a landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of pastures and how best to maintain bat groves and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and across the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from building and development work affecting nesting and habitat loss.
Wind and light turbines can also pose a risk, as poisoned papers can capture insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
The bats actually aren't blind.
However, due to their notorious hunting traditions their ears are more useful than their eyes when they come to capture prey.
They use sophisticated ecolocality techniques to indicate insects and obstacles in their path when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of nests and sometimes rescues.
The organisation even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave ground in Dumfries and Galloway, welcoming eight of the Scholls' ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a very good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veterans trees and all the good habitat.
But there is much more about the bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to flourish."
He stresses the importance of checking bats for maintenance in properties as it is possible that unintentional destruction of a single maternity nest could kill up to 400 females and juveniles, possibly destroying an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, fasten or upset them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer for the Night Butterflies Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we do not yet know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers ready to seek German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo remarked claims of rape against him as "false news," saying that people "must promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are expected to courtly search the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal's player and front playing Juventus was accused of rapeting an American woman, named Kathryn Majorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that that day he had paid her $375,000 to not say anything about the incident, reported Der Spiegel Friday.
Speaking on video on Instagram Live with his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, remarked the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," said the winner of Ballon d'Or for five times while looking in the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They must become famous to say my name, but this is part of the work.
I'm a happy man and everything is doing well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to courtly search Der Spiegel about the allegations, which they called "inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player seeks compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the breach, which is likely one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discoteka, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her from the anus, according to documents that were brought to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a "99 percent" "well man" disappointed with the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and took pictures of her injuries to the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "worried by retaliation" and was worried to "be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now looking to overturn the settlement as she is still being traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he walked with Italian football legends Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK "sorry forever" to have lost car manufacturers
The UK would "sorry forever" if it would lose its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was a "concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the Brexit case of no deal would cost jobs.
Burnaston's plant - which makes Auris and Avensis of Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a production stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit of no agreement.
Toyota's production line today works on an "exact in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be border barriers that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a more who-day inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production is stopped.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border checks."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that allows, as I say, not just the success to be enjoyed at present but for us to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4 program Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say for how long production was stopped, but in a longer period, warned that increased costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually jobs would be lost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the convenor of Unite union at the plant, said its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs leave, they never return.
A spokesperson for the government said: "We have submitted an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's risky meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may "be delayed by another week" as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein takes charge of the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aids and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump would dismiss the deputy attorney general, endangering Mueller's independence, instigated Washington's rumours for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, despite there being reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who at the time had placed the United Nations in New York, which was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said that he "prefers with" dismissing Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid disguise with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both gave their testimony.
Friday, Trump gave an order to the FBI to conduct an investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh over a one-week period, which delayed further full Senate voting.
Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked questions about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "A date has not yet been set for this, it may be held this week, and may be held the following week because of all the other things going on with the supreme court.
But now we see and I always like to keep the press up to date".
Some journalists contest this assertion: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "trying to attract and influence the audience", although she said: "Although I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more Question and Answer sessions compared to any president who had agreed," she added without citing any evidence: "We looked at those numbers."
The meetings will still be held, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, this is far better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot and have seen us do it many times in the past few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump rarely answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre manner in front of groups of journalists.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit-related fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working at NHS Scotland expressing the gratitude and desire of the country that they remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to go into the cost of applications of defined status for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the exit continued, moving towards expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK Government was also stepping up its preparations for a possible no-agreement scenario.
I know this certainly is an unstable time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to support me now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring with them valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we wish you a lot to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Makes Emergency Surgery After Suffering Injury in Rasu
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie of the Tennessee State Tigers underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday when his team lost against the Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He went over the side line and like a fell there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff donated oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to the rear for further examination.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was no longer being operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is as yet no detail on the type/extent of the injury" and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the university's second year suspended, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after leaving Illinois.
Saturday in total he had five tackles before exiting the game, leading to the 18-tackle total of his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp tax charges when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp tax charges when buying property in the UK with extra money being used to help the homeless under new Tory plans
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the stamp tax will be imposed on non-taxpayers in the UK
The Treasury expects it to rise up to £120 million a year - in order to help the homeless
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers should pay a higher rate of stamp duty when buying property in the UK - with the extra money being used to help homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-wage earners.
The increase in the stamp tax will be imposed on non-taxable individuals and firms in the UK, with the extra money boosting the Government's efforts to fight sleep on the streets.
The surcharge - which is an additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental-purpose shopping - may be three percent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, which are increasing prices making it more difficult for new buyers to make a first step in the phases of purchasing housing.
Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "fantamous cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time abroad.
The new policy came out just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax cut in order to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by seizing and not using it, and urged Ms. May to abandon quotas on affordable homes in order to repair the "embarrassment of housing" situation in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed eye-catching housing reforms, including rent checks and the end of expulsions "without any blame".
He also wants to give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Ms May said: "Last year I said that I will devote my post to reversing the UK dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means arranging the crippled market of our housing.
The UK will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not fair for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies to find it easy to buy homes as busy as UK residents.
For many people the dream of having a house has become too distant, and the indignity of sleeping on the streets remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland head Jack Ross says his "fundamental ambition" is to one day become Scotland's manager.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is welcoming the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, currently in third place in League One, with three points difference from that in first place.
This summer he walked to Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and nothing more," Ross told BBC's Sportssound of Scotland.
"But when I was still a child I would often go with my father watching Scotland play in Hampden, and that always remains that thing that drew me back.
However, this opportunity comes only if I succeed in managing a club."
Those who came before Ross as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa's former head Athletic says that he did not worry about the fact that he would follow such established names into such a large club, while previously rejecting the offer from Barnsley City and Ipswich.
"At present, success for me will be based on 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It is not easy for this to arrive there, but I probably consider that I have succeeded here only if I manage to take the club back there."
Ross has only been three years in his career as a manager, after a period of chief assistants at Dumbarton and after spending 15 months with Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third category, transforming St Mirren from the edge of the relegation to Championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he is now feeling more comfortable than he would have felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
As for when he took Alloa into his hands, he recalled that "Probably this was a big change."
"I genuinely thought that a manager's post was the one best suited to me, much more than that of a player.
This might sound weird as I would have done well, had a decent living, and enjoyed some reasonable achievements.
But games can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
Still I still experience this in terms of stress and pressure of work but simply feel that a manager's post is suitable for me.
I have always wanted to manage and now I am doing it, and I feel that my whole adult life is now feeling the most comfortable."

A survey finds that the best time to take a beer pint is at 5.30pm in the evening
The summer heat wave boosted the earnings of UK pubs in difficulty but put more pressure on the restaurants of the same company.
In July, groups of pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales - but figures revealed that restaurant earnings fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a business advisory CGA, who collected the figures, said: "Engineering sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even more.
The 1.8 percent drop in the restaurant trade in June further worsened in July.
The pubs and bars whose main sales are beverages were the ones most well off in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while restaurant sales declined.
Pubs whose main sale is food have also suffered in heat, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people wanted to simply come out drinking.
In pubs and bars managed drink sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food dropped to three percent."
Paul Newman, one of RSM's analysts regarding entertainment and hospitality said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors as regards market sales of take-aways.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent year after year will be particularly burdensome in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The hot and long summer couldn't come at a worse time for operators whose main sale is food and only time can advise us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much needed rest."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the opening of new businesses, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the downturn in the launch of new businesses.
Monitoring of Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operational groups, with combined revenues of over £9 billion, and is the industry's set benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents
A survey reveals that one in five children - some at the young age of 11 - have secret social media accounts hiding from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the "insta fake" pages
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they have a "major" bill to show their parents
One in five children - some of them at the young age of 11 - are creating social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in "Insta's false" bills - a reference to the site for sharing Instagram's photographs.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a presentable "major" bill to show their parents, while having private others.
A mother who met her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a young woman who was urging others to rape her - "stupest me."
Research, by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of young people at the age of 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that many young people are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will become the "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is mostly a track athlete and not of the track who most won medals and president Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for sport-leaders to benefit from her vast experience at an international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are certain that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can truly contribute and help run the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his total four Olympic Games gold medals and who is now a regular critic of the BBC, ended up non-walking after suffering a small stroke.
On Twitter he wrote: "Like today one month you gave me a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors have said that only time can advise us whether or not I recover or to what extent.
It was a beat job but I fully recovered, I learned how to get myself back and I am doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertisement comparing mothers to cattle gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to different opinions online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers with milking cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered "the world's first wearable and noisy breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers using the chest pump.
Four real mothers dance in a matmura filled with the straw of cattle with a disc that includes such lyrics as: "Yes, I hide myself but I don't have a tail" and "In case I haven't noticed these are not scary but breasts."
The chorus continues: "Puppy out, pump out, I'm feeding my babies, pump out, pump out, I'm milking my women."
However, the advertisement that was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 spectators and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the "terrorists" of the dairy industry.
Someone wrote "It was a very bad decision to use cattle to advertise this product.
Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their babies are taken to them within a few days of giving birth".
Elvie breast pump fits into breast-feeding bra without eye contact (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: "One understands that this is a traumatic thing for both mother and baby.
But yes why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers holding their babies?"
Someone else added: "An advertisement really cut off from reality."
Others defended the advertisement, with a woman admitting to finding the disc "very diverting."
"I think this is a genial idea.
If I were still sucking, I would buy one.
Pumping would have made me feel the same as a cow.
The advertisement is more or less a paradise but I've taken of that he is.
This is a genial product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often on their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an advertisement praising or judging the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women unveils that they were all dancing with the pumps that don't give in to the eye put in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump, makes no noise, has no wire or tube and fits into a breast-feeding bra without giving in to the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even come out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD in Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By linking women using the breast pump to the dairy cows we wanted to put the focus on pumping the breasts and all the challenges it poses, while showing in a fun and related way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has appeared on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved Wordless to a Texas Border-Tinding Camp
The number of migrant children detained increased sharply despite the monthly border crossing remaining too unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it more difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that if they came forward to care for a child they would endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their dams would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or house members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we are continuing to look for these individuals," Mr Albence said.
In order to speed up the trial involving children, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through a video phone conference, instead of personally, in order to bring arguments in favor of their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid will be immediately deported.
According to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the more children are held in custody, the more likely they become anxious or distressed, which may cause them to express themselves violently or try to escape.
Lawyers have said that these concerns increase at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs are more likely to be ignored that a child is finding it difficult, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving enough time to prepare emotionally or without saying strength to their peers could lead to trauma many of which are already fighting.
Syria tells the "occupier forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war now lying in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be properly addressed."
"They should withdraw immediately and without any condition," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism has almost come to an end" in Syria, where as of 2011 more than 360,000 people died, with millions more being moved from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "to fight this sacred battle until we are expelled from all Syrian territories" both the terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 trupees in Syria, many of whom train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 ground trupts in the war-destroyed country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were right for them to return, and blamed "in some Western countries" for spreading irrational fears" that led refugees to keep away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition in order to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last strong major rebellion has created an opportunity to keep political talks going.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, housing three million people.
However Moualem emphasized that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted "to reviewing articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Mandate
With this logic, in 2020 Mr Trump will win re-election provided that, as many liberal viewers are hoping, the denunciation and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
What would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic finale ever in a presidency!"
So far, it appears that viewers have not yet sunk.
As of 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at the time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million of four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" increased cable television ratings by even 3.5 million viewers in major news nights.
"This is a situation that is attracting people to it because it is not something we understand," said Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC drama program "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedies writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote Mr Trump.
Why? asked she.
"He said, 'Why she laughed at me,' she told me Mrs. Scovell.
In this chaos there is entertainment value.
Undoubtedly, unlike anything else on TV, the storyline titles coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the strength of the global economy.
To ignore what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, this goes beyond being an informed citizen when in six you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of sourceing "with a deep background" for his book "Fear," the blind-skinned bomber jacket ("apparition reflecting pride," said The Washington Post) of Paul Manafort worth $15,000 and the implications of Mr Trump's anatomy appalling descriptions by Stormy Daniel.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"A part of what he is doing that makes it as if this is a reality show is that every night he is leading you something," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing cast and development in the daily plot of the Trump program (fight with the N.F.L., praise to Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to miss one episode because otherwise you fall behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his home the weather was sunny at 80 degrees on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not arise from before television, not when there was Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when we used to do those excelling programs before and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilisation,'" Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some joke, but in truth they were right."

Large amounts of money arriving from abroad to tightest racing in the White House mid-term election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's seventeenth congressional district is seeing a large quantity of money, thanks to a realignment of congressional districts acquiring two operators in a race for the same seat.
This has recently re-established the pits of the Pittsburg suburban district Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is emerging as a candidate against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th old district, extending heavily over the new seventeenth district.
The maps were re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were anticonstitutionally impeached in favor of Republicans.
The race in the seventeenth new district provoked a difficult financial campaign contest between the major party's finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning with little difference in the March special election followed heavily for Pennsylvania's eighteenth congressional District.
That seat was Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political critics have given the Democrats a small advantage.
United States Consider Penalizing El Salvador For Supporting China, Then Deciding Not to Do It
The Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little assistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held an accurate meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and held a hotel in Panama until some partners expelled the Trump Organization administrative team.
State Department officials decided to contact the American heads of diplomatic missions again from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said department spokesman Heather Nauert, in a statement at the beginning of this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, who in 2017 received about $140 million in American aid, including narcotics controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be burdensome for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings began to progress, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year which was seen as a step forward in efforts not to move to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials of the highest administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with the aim of effectively ending any consideration of a penalty for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been strongly criticized to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration places on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three sent Americans returned quietly back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and tough message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesperson, Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were sustained by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke of the condition of anonymity.
History Study
The next unexpected negative event may be special adviser Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, about which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
Mr Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that Congress moves to another person, Mr. Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares himself to go back to the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainties, and I do not aim to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalent in Europe.
There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will be.
In 1938, German officials were willing to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, had the West resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have not succeeded, and we have lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves with such points of inflection, and the inexorable walk of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today Americans face many of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested for the president to be secretly recorded and speculated that he is unsuitable for the post.
Mr Rosenstein said the report of The Times is inaccurate.
"How will we answer if the F.B.I.'s newly requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual conduct and dishonest testimony?
And above all, in the middle of the terms will we vote for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, it will take time for there to be a shift in democracy.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the house of my ambassadors.
She managed to live, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship ‘God sent me to turn the candles on that table with swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic before the competitive match with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the win against the Austrians, following the impressive equal result they brought in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to a 2-2 equal result with Villarreal but he believes Rangers could use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"This has been a good point for us since Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old boy.
"We came to the game with the belief that we could get something and got out by a point.
We could probably have won it towards the end but, all in all, an equal result was probably a fair result.
Probably they were better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Thursday will be a great European evening again.
We hope we can get three points but this will be difficult because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can continue to do our utmost and achieve a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, between all that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but despite this there is currently a sense of positivity.
The team is good and the boys are taking great pleasure; the training is being good.
I hope we can do our best now, forget last season and succeed."
Women are worrying about this savings-related fear for retirement
Despite the fact that participants in the polls had a clear idea of how they wished to be indoctrinated, few people were talking to their family members about this.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said that they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be a family member who indulges them, but they are not taking the steps to make a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
You should start that.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes well ahead of time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, as those options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial advisor: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy with a hybrid cash value in order to help cover these costs or make self-insurance with your own good - provided you have money.
Make a decision after discussing your legal documents in the long term: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare proxy to select a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider a proxy for your finances.
Choose a trusted person to make your financial decisions and make sure your accounts are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you will be ready.
"Aren't the finances just that are involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the pills?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
See that plan's ready."
A man was hit several times by air rifle mortars at IIfracombe
A man was hit several times by a shot of an air rifle as he was walking home after an evening outside.
The victim, who is on the forty years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of IIfracombe, Devon, when he was struck by a tire in his chest, abdomen and hands.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have appealed to witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, officials said, with the number of deaths expected to rise.
With damages in communication lines, aid officials were unable to obtain any information from Donggala's regency, which is an area north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake's epicentre with a 7.5 power.
In Palu, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
These are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, about the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central province of Sulawesi, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of the coast northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regency, an administrative region under a province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit the west side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in the upper Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-strong earthquake struck southern Java, which is Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast heavily, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-strong earthquake struck near the town of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-metre-high earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Low Earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, which caused destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 were killed due to buildings that crashed.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mostly on the upper side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's Greatest Child Arrested on Accused of Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the eldest child of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female conscent tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone out of her hand.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "certainly, not guilty" when asked to give his motive, reported the network.
Palin is facing three Class A offences, i.e. he can be imprisoned for up to a year and has to pay a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been made against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, phoned the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering in the domestic violence crime report, and possessing a weapon in his possession while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that her blows with a ponn in her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups after a comparison was made between her child's violent behaviour and post-raumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-strong earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just a little outside the centre of Sulawesi located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos showing the moment of impact are circulating on the media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great power.
Federal prosecutors are demanding that the suspect of the NYC terrorist attack be given a rare death penalty
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding that Sayfullo Saipov who is the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people be awarded the death penalty - a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a road to bicycles along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, having in October flown the pedestrians and cyclists stranded on his way.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to the notice on intent to claim the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two chiefs of the indictment carry with them a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over to Saipov 22 heads of the charge which included eight charges of murder with the help of organized recapture, which is typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of motor vehicle violence and destruction.
Describing the way in which Saipov carried out this attack "fascinating, cruel and immoral", prosecutors said the attack required "substantial pre-planning and meditation."
The notice on intent states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last sued a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug providers but finally in September 2009 he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty was committed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being convicted of conspiring to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the head of the charge.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He responded not guilty to the 22 heads of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "certainly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty motive for his life in prison with no possibility of release will further prolong only the trauma of these events to anyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team previously asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
MP Tory says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised that he would "mobilize the people's army" .
The former Ukip chief said that politicians had to "sense them under pressure" from Eurosceptics - as suggested by one of Theresa May's own MPs that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party member Peter Bone's government told the demonstration in Birmingham that so far the UK "would have gone out" had Mr Farage been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Ms. May to reconcile her highly divided positions was highlighted by non-Brexit-friendly Tories who joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks by Brexiters, anti-Brexiters and the EU.
The allies insisted that despite the negative reaction it will keep moving forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - forcing the Eurosceptics and the Labour party to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr Bone told the rally Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted "to put aside Chequers' plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given a high social position and should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have issued so far," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added, "I will defend Brexit but we need to put aside Chequers' plan."
When he declared that he is against the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and must remain is not absolutely true."
Andrea Jenkyns, Brexitiera of Tory, was also present for the demonstration, where she told reporters: "I want to say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers' plan is not popular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for him, not popular with our party and with our activists who are in truth the ones going on the streets and who first of all vote for us.
Please forget Chequers' plan and start listening."
In a message aimed at Ms. May, she said: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should "sense them under pressure" that they would otherwise be going to step back from the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to go back from Brexit and we are here today to tell them that 'we won't leave you smooth if you do it'."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of going back from Brexit.
We are mobilizing in Brexit the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and will not spend until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, anti-Brexiters marched in Birmingham before undertaking a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Following the group's launch this weekend, a handful of activists waved up banners writing Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit).
Lord Adonis holding a high social position in the Labour party ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with a party app as the conference opened.
"These are the people who tell us they can have all the IT systems in place and technology for Canada and more, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete farce.
The idea of good Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren intends to "examine carefully" the possibility of coming out for the presidential election
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections it will "carefully examine the possibility of coming out for the presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the Democratic Party member of Massachusetts spoke of her future in a debate with citizens at a municipal level in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will stand for re-election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that he might succeed Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of debate with citizens at a municipal level since Trump took office.
A person attending the meeting asked her if she intended to stand for the presidential election.
Warren responded that it is time "for women to go to Washington to repair our fragmented government, and this includes a woman at the top."
An arrest was made in connection with the LSU Sims shooting murder
Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect was arrested in connection with the murder with a shooting of LSU's Wayde Sims basketball player that occurred Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. news conference ET.
Friday they released a video of the shooting, asking for help in order to identify the man who appears in the video.
Sims, aged 20, was killed by a fly near the University of the South campus on Friday morning.
According to 247sports, Saturday police chief Murphy J. Paul told media "Wayde Sims suffered from a wound caused by a fly in his head and eventually died as a result of it."
Wayde came in to defend his friend and was hit with a fly from Simpson.
Simpson were asked questions and admitted that he was on the scene, that he had a weapon, and admitted that he shot on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and was held in custody at the Parish Baton Police Department East Rouge.
Sims, a six-foot-long young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears to gain the world title after his team orders gave him the victory in the face of Sebastian Vettel
Saturday, from the moment at which Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes' team orders would play an important part in the race.
From inside position in the first row, Bottas had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel was the first to enter the stopping areas and let Hamilton race with the others in the last place of the group, something that was to be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in the stop zone after another lap and exited just behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued to walk after a little wheel-to-wheel action which caused the Ferrari driver to leave the inside with difficulty free due to the risk of cutting back after a double move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place until the end of the first lap on his birthday at the age of 21.
Then he was in the lead for most of the race by not changing his tyres with the goal of finishing quickly and jumping Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
Eventually he entered the stop zone on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen came in fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his job very well over the whole weekend and was a true gentlom saying let me by.
The team did an exceptional job indeed to get first and second place," said Hamilton.
That Was a Really Bad Physical Attitude
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday in connection with her insistence that she did not reveal the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly direct address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate of the Judicial Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "vile and nasty and not sincere."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the past few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and vile and nasty and not sincere," he said.
"When you look at confesses and disclosures of information and then say 'no, not I did it.
Not I did it."
Do You Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, revealed any information?
Remember her answer... unveiled the document - 'e, e, what?
No you do not see.
I haven't revealed anything."
See, wait a minute.
We revealed... No, it did not reveal us," he added, imitating the Senator.
Feinstein you sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was unveiled earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the disclosure was coming from her office.
"I have not concealed Dr. Ford's allegations, I have not revealed her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
"Hi asked me to keep her confidential and I kept her confidential as she asked."
But it seems that her denial was not well received by the president, who during the rally on Saturday evening commented: "You know what we know, that that was a really bad physical attitude.
It may not have revealed, but that is the worst physical attitude I have ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their purposes.
"They determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You are seeing vility, disgusting, they don't care who they hurt, whoever makes sticks in the wheels to gain power and control," the president said according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer darkened twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for the Elite League's defeat of the Week against Belfast Giants by winning the game against the same opponent 5–3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants gained two-goal advantage early in the game with two attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the same score to the team playing in his home country before Dwyer regained advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard achieved the same score for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two-goals confirmed their victory.
This was the third win of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe players, who after numerous losses advanced to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday evening.
This was the fourth time this season that these two teams met, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's first goal occurred in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a pass from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving the pass while Beauvillier doubled the advantage four minutes later.
In what was a multi-action opening period, Sullivan again brought the team playing in his home country back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie a pass at 15:16 bringing the same score to both teams.
Dwyer ensured that Giants would gain an advantage until the first break of the game when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The team playing in his home country was reunited and again thanks to Bouchard they again reached the other team with a strong gull at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee a first-time advantage in the game at the end of the second period and secure the win with a fifth-goal for his team in the middle of the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies To Ensure That Hundreds Of People On The Airplane Can Flee From The Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being considered a hero after he died to ensure that an airplane carrying hundreds of people manages to land safely.
Over 800 people died and many were lost after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi Friday, which triggered a tsunami.
Strong shakings continued to rule the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save, 21-year-old boyfriend Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower swinging at Palu Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained calm in order to ensure that Batik Air's Flight 6321, which at that time was sitting in the runway, was able to take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought this was crashing.
He died later in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the likely decision saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan in order to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he left us this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"When we hear about this we feel great anguish," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the count is still increasing because many bodies were still under the rubble while many could not be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching up to six metres destroyed Palu in which a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance inserts the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "Indonesia's Red Cross are working hard to help those who are still alive but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking you all to work day and night in order to complete every task related to the evacuation.
Ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
An airplane accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is found lost after the plane accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is found lost, having previously said that the 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, she was unable to detail where one male passenger was located.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water when it attempted to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Friday officials said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the incident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The U.S. Navy's airline and Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon just away from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane jumped off the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"This is a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get through the water that was high to their waist until the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said that flight assistants were panicing and shouting, and that he suffered from a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve a wharf also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat in order to carry passengers to shore before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that over the past two decades 111 people have died in airline accidents registered with PNG but no incidents have involved Air Niugini.
An analyst presents a timeline of the evening in which a woman was burned alive
Saturday the prosecution concluded her evidence on the case in the new trial of a man who is accused of having burned a woman from Mississippi while she was alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as expert witnesses in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described for the jury how he used mobile phone records to bring together information about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the victim, Jessica Chambers, aged 19, on the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received localization data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on that night she died, contradicting his earlier statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the mobile data showed that he was with Chambers at the time at which he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night he was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said he was "guying, since my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only one week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers's messages, phone calls and contact information from his mobile phone.
"He deleted it from his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expects the trial to go through to the jury later that day.
The High Breemed: What is conscious hip hop?
Three hip hop artists want to challenge the genre's negative perspective by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breeted, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has moved beyond its origins of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and remake the popular conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny from NY sued a couple for expelling her after a "racist" message
Nanny from New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message by mistake from the mother that she was complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist, and compare the cause to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new person who enjoins the children, Giselle Maurice, was of dark carnage when she came to the first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEEEEEPE PERSON OTHER SOUTH," she wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After being noticed by her coarse mistake, Plasco-Flaxman felt "discomfortful" and expelled Mrs. Maurice, stating that her predecessor's nanny, which was African-American, did not do her job well and that instead she was waiting for a Philippine, according to the New York Post.
Mrs Maurice was paid for her one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation regarding dismissal, and is claiming compensation of $350 a day for the six-month live-in position for which she had been initially hired, despite being without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, you can't do such things," she told Post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked the claims that they are racist, saying that Ms Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't intend to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco said to Post.
"But would you trust your children in the hands of someone who spoke to him with the bulky, even if that was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
And come on."
Comparing the cause to "extortion", Plasco said that only two months had passed since his wife had had the baby and was located "in a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to accuse someone so?
It's not nice to do," the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly announced the couple on social media, insulting them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoe who's being read it for the first time before it's published.
"It's really fun to now know what we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book from a small play bear, would surely have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book publication was "pleasant but somewhat saddened" after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he was never talking about it.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't filled with it ourselves," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like when you have a child to get something: be proud of them even if it wasn't you to have achieved something.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he was always giving merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to give her the last greeting on the phone
Upon landing her daughter was immediately taken to Nice Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, where doctors worked to save her her life but it was all in vain.
"Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, that she wasn't expected to live," Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the last greeting.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I would be with you soon.
I would be with you.
The medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowing down and leaving her system slow.
She had died some of the time before and began to scroll everything.
All I could do is sit down and wait, aware that all this is happening.
I could not shout or scream or weep by being surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold back really."
Eventually Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who had so far been crying for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I had her head lowered, and tears began to fall all the time.
Hard to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy towards Nad.
That he needed my love and that we make mention.
I knew how much he loved her."
Place cards of grieving women to avoid suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost someone dear to suicide are working to prevent others from removing themselves with their hands.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were attaching cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis's son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer with depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew for his smile.
They always used to say that his smile would light every room."
However, he had to quit work before he died, because he was located "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always afraid this will be the cause of another ugly event."
Ms Davis created the cards, "in order to let people know that there are people you can confide in or meet, even if as a friend.
Don't put in silence - there's a need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend for years with Mrs. Davies, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, not much after his mother's death.
"He wasn't saying he is feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day he was very bad - when the children opened their gifts he made no contact with them with his eyes or something so."
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but they want to fight her: "It leaves a void in the family.
It shatters us.
But all of us want to continue with our lives and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in a precarious situation as the FBI begins an investigation
"I said, if we were able to get something like what he asked for - a limited investigation in time, limited in purpose - maybe we would have brought a little unity," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "closing" amid partisan paralysis that raised roots.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due entirely to timing.
Mid-term elections are only located five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans do not do well, in that case they will be severely weakened in their attempts to put the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was catching the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where they currently occupy a 51st Republican and 49th Democrat position.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to vote and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea "falls" under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters for South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Citing a date from the ministry for the unification of the Lower Side, Park Byeong-seug, said that last year there were 1,127 party changes - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates humans' smugglers were demanding were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of the deserters from the North Side would evetably be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most of them escape by passing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross compared to the highly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China regards deserters as illegal migrants instead of refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
Upper Side-Southern relations - technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were focused on the stalemate of denuclearization negotiations.
This followed the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the Korean peninsula free of nuclear danger.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed in US sanctions for the lack of progress made since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will in no way be the first to unilaterally remove weapons," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," saying that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi called the nominee for the Supreme Court Mr. Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court due to his temperamental behaviour.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not but think in the fact that if a woman were ever to behave that way, they would say "hysterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotionalized, at times he was even shouting and hugged when he was talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "an assassination of the grotesque and coordinated character" organized by liberals who are angry that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because she showed that he has prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrates," she said.
Pelosi welcomed when asked if she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say a thing -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, so he's not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but even to be in the court in which he is currently in it," said Pelosi.
Currently Kavanaugh is a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, being considered a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he overturns certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is inappropriate for a person with hysterical prejudices to go to court and wait to say, 'very well,' said Pelosi.
And Women Need to Exercise Their Authority.
It's a fair verbal attack, months and years full of anger, and she can't tell what she has to say without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said the junior Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is a rare thing, what do you say?"
She added, "It helped me a lot of a woman who was laughed at elsewhere, who said that even she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and she would start crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "Probably you're thinking she's upset because I'm crying.
I'm rabid."
And then it didn't stop.
And I thought this was something brilliant."
Weeping is allowed as a way to unleash one's great anger in part because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of the first jobs I had, in an office dominated by men, where I once found myself crying with indescribable anger, was when an older woman grabbed me by the coat of my neck - a cold manager whom I always feared some of her - and carried me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angered.
They think you're annoyed and feel happy that they managed to hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Democratic congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he would stand for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage relationship on a boat known as Monkey Business and emerged from the election, Mrs. Schroeder, very angry, concluded that there was no reason why she would not explore the idea of coming out herself for the presidential election.
"This was not a well thought out decision," she said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who would stand for election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Nani."
As this was at the end of the campaign, she was unemployed back in fundraising, so she sworn that she would not stand for election if she did not make $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who were giving $1,000 to the men to her were giving her only $250.
"They think I'm taking some discount?" she said.
When she made her speech where she announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so emotioned - grateful to the people who supported her, angered with the system that it made it so difficult to raise funds and to target voters instead of delegates, and angered at sexism - that she was hanged.
"I probably would have thought I should braked these brightly," Ms Schroeder recalled about the way in which the media reacted to her.
"I would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my grave?
'Hi wept'?""
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The numbers of aerial bombings of the opening of the trade war between the US and China would have shattered you, and while the battle still remains to end, a misunderstanding between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, gave the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing all goods entering the United States from China.
Beijing retaliated each time in the same way, while more recently it was presenting tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has pledged to agree with the United States every time, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will give up in the near future.
The fact that Washington makes a move back means accepting the demands, but publicly the fact that China surrenders to the United States will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing works wisely, the pressures of the U.S. trade war can positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that start economic chaos in both countries is actually much more dangerous than what spectators have recognized before," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security (Center for New American Security), which is a think tank.
Syria stands "ready" for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it stands ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011 more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the sedition.
Europe embraces Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in European ground and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points it needed to win the United States.
Phil Mickelson who is preminent in the United States, who struggled throughout the tornament, gave his coup ti in the water at the 16th hole par-3, thus surrendering his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all of his rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players who have ever brought 5-0-0 since the actual tornament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against the lowest level player on the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's top-tier player, Dustin Johnson, brought 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who played in his Ryder Cup final.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best ever European tornament player with 25.5 points throughout his career.
"Normally I don't cry but today I couldn't keep it.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas who chose me and who believed in me.
I am very happy, very happy that I got back the cup.
The team is everything, and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia emotioned after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot partner John Ram who won U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles play Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel, that I won Tiger Woods, when I grew up following him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record 13-21-3 throughout his career.
Weird statistics of one of the best players ever, winning 14 main titles, second behind only Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled the entire weekend to find those parts of the golf track with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high calibre golf during the entire tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put some pressure on Europe.
We argued.
To Thomas we go down the hat.
He is a very good master.
His 12 players played very well.
We will reunite, I will work with America's PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 young men and I am proud that I am a master.
You will have to catch the hat and tilt your head.
Played better than it."
