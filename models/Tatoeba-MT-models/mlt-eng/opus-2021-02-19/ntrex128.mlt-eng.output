AMs from Wales fear that "be seen as a foolish"
There is a conernation among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Wales Parliament).
This was raised by plans to change the name of the assembly of the Wales Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are worrying that this will cause them to look ridiculous .
A Labour AM said that his group was concerned that "it has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers from abroad Wales: Wales’s language twp means a sbleh and a pwp means a rat.
AM of Plaid said that the whole group was ‘unsatisfied and suggested alternatives.
Conservative from Wales said that his group had an "open mind" on name change, but noted that there was a small verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this context the letter w in Wales's language is pronounced in a similar way to the pronunciation of the letter and.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptor of what should be called Assembly Members will of course be a matter for members themselves."
The act of the Government of Wales of 2017 empowered the assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals with broad support for the assembly to be called a Wales Parliament.
On the issue of the AM title, the Commission favoured Members of the Wales or WMPs Parliament, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus could be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of how to call when to have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia they leave public opinion in a referendum on changes in the name of the country
Votes will vote Sunday on whether to change the name of their country for the "Northern Macedonian Republic."
The popular vote was established with the aim of resolving a dispute lasting decades with the neighbouring country Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time that the name of its northern neighbor represents .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposer of the plebsite on name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is simply the consequence of the EU and NATO entry.
St. Martin's Snakes Stop Playing as Churches in Harlem are Sending
"Storically, the elders I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's no."
He said he can understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People associate in a different way" today.
"The bars are no longer the centre of activity of the locality where people go on a regular basis."
As regards churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later they will end up where they were at the beginning."
He added that churches can be replaced by apartment blocks filled with the type of people who will not help the rest of the local sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy condomains in this building will be a white carnage," he said, "and thus, they will not trouble when the day they are created for these churches because most of these people are likely to live in these condomains will not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built from congregations of people of white carnage before Harlem became a metropolis of people of white carnage - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original Methodist Congregation of people of white carnage left in the 1930s.
A congregation of black carnage people who practiced religion nearby took the title for the building.
St. Martin's was taken from a congregation of people of black carnage under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boicott of retailers at 125 Street, a main road to shopping in Harlem, who resisted the rental or promotion of people of black carnage.
Nar in 1939 left the building with serious damage, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and the successor of St. Martin's, was proud when he called the carillon "the bells of the people."
The expert who played carillon in July called him another thing: "Cultural Treasury" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world that had a musician of a black carnage, Dionisio A. Lind, who walked to the greater carillon in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not change with anyone else.
What happened in St. Martin's during the past few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some of whom were introduced by the leaders of the laity church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The 'vestry' - the parish government body, made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with a concern that the diocese "will seek to pass on the costs" to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in taking over the architects and contractors who sent it from the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark hurts a 13-year-old boy during a Norway lobster dill in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was feeding for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, said the officers.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. where Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSRB-TV in San Diego that he was playing with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child shouting for help and then went open to a group to help draw out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of the back to catch lobster, but then "I realized that he was shouting, ‘Gidim me!
Gidim me!'
He spent and opened the whole clavicol," Hammel said that he realized the moment that he arrived where the child.
'I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
They took the child through a helicopter up to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in a critical condition.
The species of sharks responsible for the attack was not known.
Larry Giles said at a meeting with the media that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with scarifiers similar to those of a ‘department store’ of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial entry into the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while selling clothing and goods for domestic use decreases, larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country and the idea will spread to more shops next year if successful.
Investment in beauty came after supermarkets were looking for ways to use space on shelves once used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it will double the amount of beauty items that it is offering up to 3000 items, including firms such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The market share of the Union industry increased by 10 % during the period considered, while the market share of the Union industry increased by 10 percentage points.
The supermarket will also relaunch the range of his Boutique makeup so that the majority of products are fit for vegans – something that is increasingly being requested by smaller buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume retailer will examine concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's, which the first opened in Croydon, London lower, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying with small amounts of food every day in local convenience shops means that supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that shops will appear increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight against Aldi and Lidl price discount shops with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been placing Argos shops in hundreds of shops and also introduced a number of Habitats as it bought both chains two years ago, which says that it strengthened the sales of the grocery and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the link ended after a struggle on how to share the revenues from the pharmacist's shops in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was introduced after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business with 281 shops to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million, three years ago.
By adding an extended range of luxury skin care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four shops, the Lisbons said.
Paul From Hicks, the business director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the image and feeling of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our firms has been designed to be appropriate for all needs and the attractive environment and the convenient positions of the shops mean that we have become a destination of beauty products of interest that challenge the old way of purchasing."
Peter Jones 'very rabies' after Holly Willoughby cancels an agreement of £11 million
Dragons Den Peter Jones' personality 'very angry' after TV submitter Holly Willoughby cancelled an agreement of £11 million with his lifestyle brand business to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for the firm of home products and accessories thereof, Truely.
According to the information provided by the Norwegian authorities, the market share of the shares in the company was around [...] % and the market share of the company was around [...] %.
The presenter of Thi Morning, 37, appeared on an Instagram to announce that he will leave.
Holly Willoughby left the personality of Dragons" Den Peter Jones very angry because it cancelled it from being part of their business of a highly costly lifestyle firm in the last minute – to focus on its big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "very angry" when the personality of the very popular television admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his enromal business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new agreements – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that it was no longer enough to dedicate it to their brand of household products and accessories, Truely.
The business was compared with the Gwyneth Palm Goop firm and was intended to double the estimated wealth of Willoughby of £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, it appeared on Instagram to announce that it was going to leave Truly, Jones left Great Britain and went to one of his private holidayrs.
Source: "Truly was by far Holly's first priority.
It would be its long-term future that would be completed by the next few decades.
Its decision to leave left everyone completely surprised.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch had almost arrived.
There is a full storehouse produced at Marlow headquarters ready for sale."
The experts believe that the departure of this Morning presenter, who is among the personalities of Great Britain that bring a profit, can mean a cost of millions for the company due to a large investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and the potential for further delay to its launch.
And it can mean ending a long friendship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her hell Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truely with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman chairman chairman in March.
Couples travel together and Jones has a 40 per cent share in the Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby is to become an ambastir of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV I'm A Celebrity presenter.
Yesterday evening, a source near Jones said "We do not comment on his economic affairs."
A difficult meeting 'but then we found love'
He clarified about criticisms that he will get from the news media for making a comment that some people consider "non-popular" and for being so positive about North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a voice that imitates that of a " news presenter".
"I did not give up anything."
It noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump boasted that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But denuclearisation negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's best diplomatic, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders, on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea does not see a US "correspondent response" to the early stages of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, it noted, the US is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view of his manifestation.
He said, "We are walking well with North Korea".
"We were going to enter a war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
We now have this very good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results – the end of rocket tests, the help in the release of hostages and the return of American vectors left home.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It is very easy to be presidential, but instead of getting 10,000 people out who are trying to enter this arena filled with people, we would have had about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing to the crowd directly before him.
Tsunami and Terremot in Indonesia Destroy Island, Kill Ms of People
In the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not necessary.
Even after more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to move from home, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it is challenging," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it is not clear whether foreign staff can operate on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the speaker of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the earthquakes that occur in Indonesia often, the country is not well prepared for the great anger of nature.
While refuge from the tsunamis was built in Aceh, they are hardly on the coast.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite issuing a warning, has likely contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best times, travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was posted in Lombok for the care of the victims on his way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improvements to the infrastructure falling parts of Indonesia, the centre of his electoral campaign, and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's administration sent because of the lack of funds as it faces his election again next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectoral tensions still in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of this faith.

The statue of the Parliament of Cromwell becomes the last monument affected by the argument on 'rewording of history'
Other information: Member of Taliban Supreme Council as at 2009.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "gone" and "an attempt to reword the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Society Cromwell, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The ‘iconoclasm’ of British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of a 19th century opinion and part of the historianship of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliament defender against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is a fully accurate representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is sure is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure that is recognised as representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as 'Lord Protector' also deserve to be celebrated and communicated."
A Kat-Attacking and Killing Chinese Bids
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in South Western China, according to local media reports.
The man, only identified by his name "Yuan," was found dead with a cut artery, covered with blood near a beard on the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in ‘hoggery’ on 30 May 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
Reportedly, he traveled with his cousin from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found dead, and discovered a door to the pig folds in the vicinity open.
He said that there was a bloody pig in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked the farmer and killed, according to the report.
"Woe cousins were bloody and mutilated," said the cousin, who referred to him with his name "Wu," as quoted by the Guiyang Evering News.
Safety camera films showed Yuan entering the market on 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed its pigs.
Its body was found about one hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not Yuan or cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked off not to attack others, while the police gathered evidence on the ground.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been registered before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until he sent the animal his wife.
After the pigs of a farmer from Oregon attacked and ate in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba ratmer told CBC News that the pigs are not usually aggressive but the blood taste can act as a "cause."
"Be playing.
They bite, they are very curious ... do not intend to hurt you.
Only you must show them the proper amount of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa remains will bring widespread heavy rains in the south-east of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves on the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rains across the north of Mexico and south-east of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought a wind of 85 mph, a Hurricane of Category 1, at 5 a.m. in eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it forms a ‘trough’ on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east toward the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa is approaching the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will start pushing strong tropical humidity in a north-westerly direction of the United States
On Monday Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching ‘trough’ creates a heavy rain spread in the south-east in the coming days.
Locally, from 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid floods, residue streams and a possible desert avalanches.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rain rates to rise from 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
From 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the south-west, especially on a large part of the Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible under rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the spread character of tropical rain.
It would not be a good idea to go out to the desert by walking with the threat of tropical rain.
A heavy winter can cause canyons to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring in very local and dusty winds.
The ‘trough’ will bring some rain to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total rains of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause small flood flows and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain of the region of their rainy season.
Some flooded tropical rains begin to move towards Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rains become spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
A strong winter spreads in Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there may be some sharp changes in temperature across the US as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a great example of dramatic temperature differences from the US Centre on Sunday.
There is almost a difference in temperature of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the coming days, the continued summer heat will try to develop and re-expansion.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a hot start in October with temperatures ranging from the Southern Plains to parts of the North-East.
New York City can be up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is approximately 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast is indicating high possibilities for temperatures above the US average for the East during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people saw the very interesting witness on Thursday of the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of committing a sexual attack that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political fight continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with shocking last minute news of Friday: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Fake for FBI to carry out a week-to-week investigation of charges.
Ford told the court committee of the Senate that it is certain 100 percent that Kavanaugh had babased it when he was under the influence of alcohol and tried to remove her clothes when they were a festa of the level of post-secondary school.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate witness, said he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday.
the company was counting the average amount of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers are from offices.
To put this in perspective, it is an audience size similar to that for the decisive football game or for the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, said Nielsen.
ABC was immediately followed by 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the protesters of CNN and CBS cameras were caught on Friday morning and were shouting with him as they tried to go to the lift for a hearing of the Committee of the Judiciary.
He remained standing there with his eyes looking down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticised, in a broadcast directed on CNN.
"I'm standing here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think you are telling a country the truth?
He said to him "you have the power when many women have nothing.""
Flake said that his office issued a declaration and said, before the doors of the lift were closed, that he will have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcasting networks were broadcasting directly, hours later, when the Committee of the Judiciary had to vote to advance the nomination of Kavanaugh for the Senate fully to vote.
But Flake said that he was going to do so only with the understanding that the FBI was going to investigate the allegations against the nominated person in the following week, that the Democratic minorities have been encouraging.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and with several singers later, Flake took his decision.
Flake's decision was empowered, because it was evident that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened a FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister May accuses critics that they are "taking advantage of politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union that are "taking advantage of" the policy and weakening the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May reached the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview after one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former minister for foreign affairs Boris Johnson pressed his attack of the so-called 'Chequers' Plan for Brexit, and said that a proposal that Great Britain and the EU should collect each other's fees was "completely collected."

Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach told me that the team is "losed" and "under shock" after the death of Wayde.
"This is what worrys about him all the time," said Wade.
Vulkan throws the ash on Mexico city
A ash that is being disposed of by the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Messicans to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring various sounds and tectonic movements.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash that wore the car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geographic physicists noted an increase in activity in the 45 mile (72 km) volcano in south-east capital after an earthquake of 7.1 at the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The known volcano "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
POB: Simferopol, Ukrainian SSR
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrators in favour of independence had a conflict with the anti-riot police, and as thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the catalonia polarization vote on the secession.
POB: Simferopol, Simferopol region
There were also small fightings during the day and the police had to use leukabes to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, independence groups were making him "Not forgetting, we do not excuse" fighting against unionists protesting, "Spain Forever."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in protests, reported the local picture.
He is responsible for the violent repression against the civilian population.
The voters chose with a big gap to become independent, although participation was low with those who are against the secession who made a big boycot against the vote.
According to the Catalonia authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in the vote stations throughout the region in violent fighting.
Independence groups had camped overnight to prevent demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was carried out but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electricist who attended the separateist protest with his wife said that there was no hope left in the prospects of Catalonia to gain independence.
"The last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my mother and dad weeping with joy that they could vote but now we were alone," he said.
Despite having a vital and narrow victory in regional elections last December, parties in favour of Catalonia's independence are sending them to maintain the momentum this year with many of their best known leaders or in the exile they have decided themselves or in detention and are waiting for the trial because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, 42-year-old mechanic who was registering protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was caused by politicians of both sides.
"There's more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of Catalonia who was in prison before the trial from the end of last year, announced that he would contest in the European Parliament elections next year.
"By issuing as a candidate for European elections it is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car entered a house strongly
According to the Office of the SRSG on Children and Armed Conflict, he was responsible for recruitment and use of children in Ituri from 2002 to 2003.
The accident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday for the collision of 19:30 BST.
Bob Blemings investigative inspector said that the damage was caused to the grades and to the building itself.
It could also have been used 'cross-bow' to shoot at a time.
Menga's goal wins game 1-0 for Livingston against Rangers
The first 'goal' of Dolly Menga's for Livingston won the game
Livingston, who was promoted, sold to Rangers and thus Steven Gerrard lost for the second time only in 18 games as a coach of the 'club' of Ibrax.
Dolly Menga's ball shot all the difference as Gary Holt's side was equal at points with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has not yet won once out of its round in the Premiership in this season and the next Sunday is going to play against Hearts, who are first and behind them with eight points.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in their round in Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continues not to have a loss in the division in six matches, with the main coach Holt who has not yet lost a game since it came instead of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lose opportunities against goffy visitors
Holt's team should have been winning before he had a ‘goal’, with his direct play style which was causing many problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but distributed the ball in front of the rod, then Alan Lithgow could only distribute the ball with a wide hood after sliding to receive the ball from Craig Halett near the rod.
Those who were playing in their own round were happy to let Rangers play before them, because they knew that they were to visitors could give them problems at certain moments.
And that was the way in which the crucial 'goal' arrived.
Rangers left free-kick in and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Galagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and put it into the rod from the centre of the box.
By that moment, Rangers were dominating the possession of the ball, but they were finding the defence of the team who were playing in their own round, not penetrating, and the goalkeeper's Ley had little trouble,
That style of games continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos caused Kelly to welcome the ball.
Scott Pittman failed to find a ‘goal’ due to the ‘goalkeeper’ of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow shot the ball widely after distributing another player of Livingston.
Ballen were all the time entering the Livingston box and always removed from their players, while two requests for 'penalty' – following Halkett's attempt on Glenn Middleton's substitute, and another one after the ball was touched by the player's hand – were rejected.
Fenomenal' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Arena Tony Macaroni
Pharmacokinetic performance and result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
The style of games and their staff has not changed much since the return to the main fight, but the most credit should go to Holt for the way he has joined the team since he arrived.
He had many heroes.
The head Halketk was very large in his games, organizing an extremely well organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall with seven eyes.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain moments under Gerrard, there was a lack of standards well this time.
Their last chance with the ball was not good--only once managed to divide the team's defence that he was playing in his own gate--and it's a sign for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) people laughed and heard blue as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – with the aim of repairing the relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then left to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The Police quoted security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from being gathered in front of the mosque, but many people who support him appeared closely to see their president.
hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurdi - also mentioned their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome in the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero for certain German Turks and is thought to be “autocrat” from others.
Road collision in Detford: Cyclist dies at a collision with a car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred close to the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, for the collision of 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended the paramedics, but the man died on the ground.
This collision occurred a few months after another cyclist died after hitting a car and went on to Childs Street, about a mile away from last Saturday's collision.
The Metropolitan Police said that the officials were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus deviations are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.

Hurricane Rosa threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake city with Quick Floods (Next Areas Can Benefit)
Tropical depression is rare, affecting Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa moves from the south-west of the Desert, leading to risks of rapid flooding.
The National Temp Service has already established a rapid flood watch for Monday and Tuesday from Arizona west to the South and East of Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line from Phoenix on Tuesday, and approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Temp Phoenix Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones maintained tropical storm or depressive status at a distance of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950"!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 40 miles from AZ border."
The latest models of the Uragani National Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other South Western Desert areas including central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to have from inch to 2 inches, with possible total isolates up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, Rosa's rain can be positive as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial as the south-west side is currently experiencing drought conditions.
Depending on the dryer, just over 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category," reported from weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa route was replaced by the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who will be still a very strong hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific and therefore loses power.
Thus, it is expected to touch Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early evening.
The rain in parts of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inch rains are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Honor, with a possibility of no more than 10 inches," reported from weather.com.
Rosa will then move north around Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday's morning as tropical depression, and then will move from Arizona and South Utah until late evening on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its remains is a heavy rain in Baja California, in the northwest of Honor, and in the southwest desert of the United States," said the Uragani National Centre.
This rain is expected to produce life-threatening rapid floods and flood flows in the deserts, and avalanches in the mountainous terren.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested after attempted killing
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of an attempt to kill after a 16-year-old adolescent boy was found with silence wounds in Somerset.
The adolescent boy was found injured in Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, at the time of the 04:00 BST on Saturday.
They took him to the hospital where he remained in "stable" condition.
17-year-old adolescents, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, said the Somerset Police.
The officials called for anyone who can have a video drawn from the mobile phone of what happened to speak.
Trump said that Kavanaugh 'sent the green and angry' of the Democratic Party
"Vot for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a manifestation in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Treump said that Kavanaugh ‘sent the green and angry’ of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotion denied an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed during the hearing about its allegation.
On Saturday, the President said that, on that day, the American people saw Kavanaugh's "bravure and quality and courage".
"Vot who confirms Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most effective legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable public service record", he told the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We find it five weeks away from one of our most important elections.
I don't account, but in truth, I'm fighting," he said.
"I am therefore running everywhere to fight for very good candidates."
Trump argued that the democrats have a mission to "stress and obstruct."
The first main procedural vote within the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, said a superior assistant of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Lets were killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with the apparent increasing number of deaths
At least 384 people were killed, many suffered as huge waves fell strongly on beaches, after a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters (18 feet) fell strongly on the ground when they began to darken, while many suffered and died and destroyed everything that was in the middle.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 power earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not come up to happen immediately and ended up victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the speaker for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB during a breefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not appear on its own, attracted cars, stalks, houses, struck everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled along the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some people rose trees to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people have been evacuated for 24 centres in Palu.
Photos from the air that emerged from the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges that turned on themselves and fell and mosque surrounded by water.
Strong shocks continued to promise the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in the statement that the energy from the huge Weekly earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said that the city's geography, located at the edge of a long, narrow beach, could have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels had fallen.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the breakdown of fallen buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and damage can be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epidemic of the earthquake.
Communications were "fully sent out and without information" by Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was very critical because it did not inform that a tsunami struck Palu, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a social media-shared amateur video, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard in a glimpse of warnings with an anxiety for the tsunami approaching people on the road below.
In a few minutes a huge amount of water fell strongly on the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authorize the movies immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a sharp cut in light that reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities said that the military started to send cargo aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuations still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has only been reopened to aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths far exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived strong and full in the city of Palu, where the employees are taking refuge were shelters of the armed tarpolin in the courtyard of their office, they went through scenes of devastation on their way there, said Mr Doseb.
He said, "He told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed".
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups started the sad disaster relief process, some of them complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep competences were not allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start entry if the disaster site is declared as a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"The province still has a disaster," said Aulia Arriani, speakers for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"O.K., this is a national disaster," we can introduce international assistance but so far there is no status."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, the friends and family of those who are still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles to overcome this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small child came out of sewage.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was caught under crushing for two days near her mother's body.
Gendon Subandon, the Indonesian national team coach of Paragliding, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Other than those captured in Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a superior person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional weight," he said.
Mr Gendon related how, in the hours after the news of the fall of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated among the paragliding community, he sent in a desperate way, messages with WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only marked that they left, but did not mark that they arrived.
"I think what means that the messages have not arrived," he said.
Allelens take $26,750 while ATM was being refilled in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves killed $26,750 from a Brink's worker re-filling ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was hitting ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While occupied with his work, another man "was running from behind the employee of Brink's" and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the accident.
Anyone who has information about their identities shall contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rap singer changes his name to Ye
The Kanye West rap singer is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change in the Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was previously known as Kanye West"
West, 41, was immunized for some time and used the moneker as the title for his eighth album, which was issued in June.
The change takes place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the program that cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the creator of the program.
In addition to being a abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means "you," said West earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with the radio submitter Big Boy.
"So I am, you, I am, is, we.
From Kanye which means 'the only one', to Ye alone - just a reflection of what we have good, bad, what confuses us, everything.
The album is a further reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rap singers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that it preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
As one who collaborated with West, JAY-Z, he is also served with or without a sing and capital letters.
Mexico AMLO promises not to use militarys against civilians
The President-elect of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use a military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelco Square that "it will never use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
The troops shot on a peaceful demonstration in the square on the 2nd October 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left student movements were being established in all Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youth by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open up more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double the funds for I.A.
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this field, says the investor and practitioner of the IA Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made IA notices, even if there is a lack of a formal IA strategy in the US.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be first in the innovation of the IA by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for IA research would be a good start, as all other countries are much worse than the US, and we are looking for the next revolutionary step in the IA," said Lee.
The doubling of funds can double the possibilities that the next major IA will be achieved in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mikflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synnovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent IA companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that won the player with the highest rating of American Othello, and was then executive with Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognised former US government competitions in technology such as the Robotics Challenge Agency of Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when it will be the next one, to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee said that researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants.
Lee said, "It is not China that is removing academic leaders; the corporates are doing so,".
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have employed people who inspire others from universities to work on IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the US to strengthen their efforts in the IA.
He said, "I believe that the green card should be offered automatically to people who have a PhD in the IA".
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Special Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that the China National Natural Science Foundation provides funds to persons in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations issue money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
More than this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Selected Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As regards NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in IA research.
In the meantime, US legislation which has tried to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen any action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "Northern Macedonian Republic," a step to resolve a dispute that has been ongoing for decades with Greece that had blocked its membership offers for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of the war in its north represents a possibility of possession of its territory and made a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments arrived at an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of the population of the Macedonian Slavi majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycot campaign raised doubts about whether the participation is going to reach the minimum of 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote is read: "You are in favour of NATO membership and in the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter into bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that are going out of Yugoslavia's collapse.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of the parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral commission said there were no irregularities reports up to 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I've been to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in capital, Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country that gives him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was arming a small stage and preparing seats in front of the armed tents by those who are going to make a boycot of the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to enter proudly under our conditions, not by commanding others" said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If we do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others such as China and Russia and form part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that membership in NATO is going to bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the great majority is going to be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after voting.
He said that a result in favour of the change of name would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are going to take part in the referendum – an amount below that of the required participation.
Another survey, carried out by Telma TV in Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, participation should be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum does not succeed, this represents the first serious blow to the government policy in favour of the Western ideologies from the moment that it took control of it in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, the player of Manchester City, passes through Brighton's entire defence to 'goal'
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence at Manchester City victory 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made that his 'goal' in 65 minutes seemed very easy.
The attacker from Argentina received a ball from the mid-ground at the beginning of the sequence.
It ran from between three Brighton defenders before it ran into an open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green clicks.
Fight with one defender before he fled much more to the edge of the Brighton box.
Then distribute the ball on his left and find it to Sterling.
The British attacker touched the ball for the first time in the box to redistribute to Aguero, who used the right foot to insert the ball into the right side of the net by passing through where the Brighton Matthew Ryan goalkeeper.
"Aguero is suffering some problems on his feet," said City Pep Guardiola's coach to journalists.
"We talked about the fact that he was going to play 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We had the good luck of making a ‘goal’ at that moment."
But it was Sterling that gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in fighting the Premier League.
That 'goal' occurred in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in very far into the territory of Brighton in that action.
Send the right ball to Leroy Sane with the left side in a very beautiful way.
Sane touched the ball sometime before leading to Sterling where the rod.
The Sky Blues attacker touched the ball slightly and inserted into the net just before sliding into a territory into which it is not supposed to enter.
City will play against Hoffenheim at the Champions League stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in a spoiler vs. Rockies
As Nationals have been eliminated from the possibility to compete in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to restart.
But the Scherzer so competitive player hopes that it could be the pitcher on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which are ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one game.
The Rockies have succeeded in obtaining a possibility to continue to compete with a win 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday evening, but they are still seeking the first title of the division.
"Even though we are playing for nothing, we can at least have the possibility to win by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What would you not want to compete in those circumstances?
Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but they are allegedly inclined to let Scherzer be the pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting for the 34th time, had a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a pitcher on Sunday when he is usually resting.
The player from Washington who plays with his right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 'strikeout' at 220 2/3 'ings' in this season.
Trump manifestations in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation concerning the choice for his Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November, everything we have done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of our most important elections.
This is very great - I don't account, but in reality, I am fighting for very good candidates everywhere," he said.
"We are seeing this very horrible and radical group of Democratics, we see it now," Trump continued.
And they are determined to take back power by using all possible means, you can see the green.
They do not care about who they hurt, whoever wants to fly in order to gain power and control, what they want, power and control, we are not going to give them."
He said that the democrats have a mission to "stress and obstruct."
"And I've seen it over these last four days," he said, and he was calling the democrats "raised and green and disgusting and dishonest."
He referred to the Democratic Senator classified in the Committee of the Judiciary of the Senate Dianne Feinstein with his name, and received many negative shouts from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you issued the Document?
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, and no, I expect, first of all – the movements of its body were not positive at all – the worst movements I have ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a wide group.
It does not tolerate those who communicate their opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I did not take it very much.
After all, I am the most recent MP in a list of Labour Party MPs that was not welcomed in a positive way – because we communicated our views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she fought against antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Council on Friday evening were exactly so.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more warm and gentler" policy has long been forgotten if, in fact, it has never started in reality.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, since colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political understanding expected to change my mind and take positions I had never agreed with in other situations – both on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever we speak publicly - and, in reality, do not make any difference what I say - they follow me with abuse on social media with a request to remove me from my MP office, to denounce the policy of the center, and to tell me that I do not have part of the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know that I had more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily face a lot of sexual abuse or racist but never hide from comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is the fact that the levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with every motion of "lack of confidence" or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes narrower.
I have been given a lot of advice over the last two years that encouraged me to keep my views for me, so that I should not be so vocal and then everything "be well."
But I did not enter into politics to do so.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the negligence of the government of Thatcher who left my comprehensive school class literally in a disastrous state, I have sought to improve public services for those who need them most – both as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my policy, even in the past election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused, somehow, about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I say is that when the country is moving towards Brexit that is going to damage our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty towards the Labour Party leader.
But in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, is for my constituents, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to work for you and promise you that no amount of threat that removes me from my office or political expedition will discourage me from acting in those who believe that they are all your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, who have not yet lost once, climbing at the top in the rating
Two attempts could slightly change the result, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this very exciting day's Premiership Tent's game.
They are currently first in the ranking, the only team of all ten who have not once lost.
In the end, it was the superior defence, as well as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities, which helped the team, who was playing in his own stadium, winning, and the coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We still have trials during our games so far, and we have not yet lost one, so I am happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "Give Ayr credit, they took advantage of the better opportunities than we have."
With the attempt of Grant Anderson's in 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, but, a yellow card from the head of Scotland Rory Hughes, which was left to play the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Baggot made an unverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's victory by 'penalty', before, in the middle of the exact game, he made a 'goal' and converted an individual attempt to bring 17-5 points to Ayr in the pocket.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and the attempt of Patrick Anderson's, converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap by 5 points.
Then stopped the game due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who came out of the round on a stretcher, and upon re-starting the game, Ayr continued to hide the points after an attempt by Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
Then, the head agent of Ayr Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose came out of aggression when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of hard pressure.
However, the team that was playing in his own round started to attack again, and when she was given a yellow Struan Hutchinson card for the action he took on Climo without the ball, from the 'penalty' line, MacPherson touched the ball to the back of the Ayr group that was advancing.
Climo converted, as he did again almost from the area from which the game starts again, after Kyle Rowe collected the ball that David Armstrong met through the box and sent Gregor Henry, who plays side by side, for the fifth attempt of the side that she was playing in its own round.
Still Game's personality seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game Ford Kerman's personality appears ready to enter the hospitality industry after being discovered as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man who makes Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular program, who writes and participates in him with his long-term partner of the comedy Greg Hempill.
The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the last of the programme, and it seems that Kiernan is planning for his life after Craiglang.
According to the lists of official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The player refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scotish Sun gave a hint that Kiernan was seeking to get involved in Glasgow's very good restaurant trade.
'The sea is our': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
The seafarers are on the watch of the naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
Public buildings have an ocean-coloured blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with motto: "The sea is ours right.
To recover it is a duty."
Around all the Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the lost coast to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict remains clear - as the desire for Bolivians to be able to sail in the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia expects a decision by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and obviously is waiting for the result with a positive mind," said Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomatic of Bolivia.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the ICJ on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find, in favour of Bolivia's statement, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia – who is facing a controversial battle for his election again next year – also has much to lose in Monday's decision.
"It is very close to having access to the Pacific Ocean again," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court decides in favour of Bolivia - and that it would slightly change if it would do so.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant the territory of Chile, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the GI judgment only comes six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case "was not complicated" said Paz Zárate, an expert from Chile in international law.
And far from being favoured in the case of Bolivia, the last four years may have been unaided.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
The hostile rhetoric of Morales weakened any residual goodwill of Chile, it suggested.
Bolivia and Chile, at some point, will continue to speak, but it would be very difficult to hold discussions thereafter.
Both countries have not been party to ambassadors since 1962.
The former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an "extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the "opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular Latin American presidents - was using the maritime issue as political aid.
"The Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the United States
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never disarmament nuclear weapons is the first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri had spoken on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He asked the United States to deliver on the promises they made at a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments are passed as the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seems to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy that is stagnated more than three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says that it is "hope in the gap" that the ongoing sanctions and the United States' objection to a declaration to end the Korean War will never force North Korea to give up.
Washington is concerned about whether it should agree to the declaration without Pyonggyang making the first significant disarmament steps.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a widespread scepticism that Pyonggyang is serious to waive an armament that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee his security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyonggyang in the next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collection of massive head clothes that will soon appear in the main shops.
If you want to add to your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you can stop looking.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a range of strange and very large head clothing for their Spring and Summer 2019 collection on the runway that inspired the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Instagram this summer and these designers have raised their surprising creations on the stage.
The article that stood mostly from Valenciano was an extravagant beige chapel decorated with a wide feathers-like edge completely covering the heads of the models.
Other very large-scale accessories included gel-coated watermelons, sailor chapels and even pineapples – but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a choice of strange masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than ‘haute coat’.
One reaction was like a complete diving device with snorkel and goggles, while another was like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue with this good style-worst.
Those who follow the fashion predict that huge 'bunkets' will soon appear in the main shops.
The very large hats come out after the issue of 'La Bomba', the maiden chapel with a wide edge of two feet which was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratikikowski.
The "cult label" responsible for the unpractical chapel that appeared very much on social media brought another great creation on the stage – a straw bag that contains almost as much as the malja model she was carrying.
The dark orange raffia basket, surrounded by the small raffia spag and a white skin grip, was the most outstanding creation in the spring and summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
A famous star Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I am waiting to see hats and big sea bags in the main shops for the coming summer - since the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very big accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland keep a record of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to give the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain a topic of popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If he spoke a man in a language he understands, he understands with his mind.
If he spoke in his own language, he understands with his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the forefront of classification tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages gained A Higher grade.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are members of the SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher grade A in the Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also gained A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject option, held in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons they gave employers for sending to fill vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Irrespective of the career to choose, learning another language will have a real advantage in the future as it will be able to stay such a life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically places a multilingual front-liner in the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation and, by 15 percent, French is the only language spoken with a percentage of two numbers.
That is why investment in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding a significant job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be a number of languages you can choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot be denied at present, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, and should therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should truly be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's youth.
The fair bend le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
On Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with Lakers in San Diego
LeBron James’ sports supporters did not have much to wait for the first time for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Luke Walton's coach announced that James will play in the opening game before the season starts on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes to play still needs to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The journalist of the Lakers Mike Trudell wrote tweet that, probably, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
After the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the schedule of the six games before the Lakers season begins.
"In this stage of my career I do not need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Maniestation of Trump in West Virginia, Channel of Youtube
President Donald Trump starts a wave of manifestations of the campaign tonight in Weeling, West Virginia.
This is the first manifestation of Trump from five scheduled next week, including stops in a friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the suspended confirmatory vote for its choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in Nov.
At the time is Trump's manifestation in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
The manifestation of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, 29th September, 2018.
You can see the manifestation of Trump in West Virginia online below via a live broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely to address this week's hearings for the nomination of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who have become intense due to allegations of sexual misconduct with an early confirmation vote of the Senate suspended up to one week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary aim of this wave of manifestations is to help the Republicans face the November elections to achieve some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five manifestations next week are aimed at "giving power to volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Congress's Control is so important for this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we come close to the season of the challenging campaign," he told Reuters speaker for the Trump campaign that he refused to mention his name.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's manifestation can gather supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media coverage of Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump will have visited West Virginia, the state which won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Republican Senate of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the survey.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to give him a boost in the survey," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US Team determined not to give up while moving to Sunday singles
After three sessions of one side, Saturday's foursomes may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing of momentum is a concept of sport completely invented but one in which players really believe, and never more than in such competitions.
So where do they say that we have the momentum now?
"These were in front with six points and are now four, so I think we are carrying it as a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he left the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four front points with another twelve to be overcome.
The Americans, says Spieth, feel that they have few obstacles and have much to encourage them, not at least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them boast with three points out of four.
Spieth was accurate from tea to green and is leading by example.
That heartfelt cry of a celebration continued to grow as his round continued, making a crucial putt to bring the fourth game equal when he and Thomas were two-thirds after two.
His putt that won the game on 15 was welcomed by a similar cry, the kind that tells you to believe that the American team is still there.
"Very must enter deep and worry about your own item," said Spieth.
This is what has left them each of these players now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points from Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sweet couple are four with four and are considered perfect.
"Moliwood" were the only pair that did not darken a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogyys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine after Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy is moving both towards and from this living crowd establishes that it is the players that are challenging Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun falls on Le Gulf National from Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at once on different holes.
But here we are talking about an early European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon completed by Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when placed in a pair with Alex Noren.
Bogyy and two doubles on the fore nine have brought Spanish and Swedish into a hole that has never managed to get out of it.
But on Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very tantamount to seeing them closely because of the interactions between the peers, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way a strategy can be turned into a second.
Europe has better played as a team so it has reached its lead in the final day but this foursomes session has also shown that the US Team is determined that some, especially on the US side, were questioning.
Europe leading by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take good advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup following its release from Saturday's fourball and foursomes matches with 10-6 on the United States.
The inspired pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molari made the effort with two wins on Tiger Woods who found it difficult to take their score so forward in Le Gulf National for four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European side, ready to keep the trophy that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went wrong in morning fourballs, which took the series by 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in foursomes, by winning two parties, but could not reach the difference in score.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from the 12 items of one Sunday player to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season to win four points in succession while it is and Molari, immunized "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their four opening items in the Ryder Cup's history.
After dominating on Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs then worked excellently to win Wods that did not seem optimistic and the new American player for the Bryson Dechambeau season with an even more empathetic score of 5&4.
Woods, who found it difficult in both parties on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliant but now lost 19 of his 29 items in fourballs and foursomes and seven in turn.
Justin Rose, rested for morning fourballs, returned to Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes for a loss of 2&1 of Dutin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which are ranked first and third in the world.
But it did not come everything as Europe wanted on a beautiful day, with a little baffle in south-west Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a great winner three times, and Justin Thomas set the limit for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They achieved a courageous victory of 2&1 on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned later to win Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in the Ryder Cup's history that a team returned from a difference of four points while it was entering the singles, although the holdingers of the Furyk side need to get used to keep the trophy.
However, after they were the second best for two days, a Sunday attack seems to be more than they can do.
North Korea says that "in no way" will unilaterally disarmament without confidence
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were deepening its lack of trust in the United States and that there was no way that the country would unilaterally leave its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "considerable good will measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promised not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Rerepeta reported family complaints from North Korea on Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea was rewarded as it takes gradual steps, its declaration was shown significantly not to refuse unilateral denuclearisation without thought as it had done in the past.
Refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea was looking for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Gyongyang first wants to divest its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to reduce hard international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearisation first" and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their objective in a coercive way, and even objects to the "end-of-war declaration," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can break is a dream of people who do not know about us.
But the problem is that ongoing sanctions are deepening our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the part of this denuclearisation was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have led to such a block."
Nevertheless, Ri's tone of speech was dramaticly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea's continental land with North Korean rockets was inevitable after Mr. Kattiv" Trump called Kim "a man of rockets" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that there is still a lot of work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearises.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not have a timetable for this, saying "If you take two years, three or five months - it does not make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Thursday, told the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without stopping until we realise fully and finally verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council unanimously strengthened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with the aim of stopping funding for the Pyronggian ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyrongging next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He departed from Pyonggyang in July while he said that progress was made, after a few hours in North Korea criticized him for making "gangster-like claims".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to disarmament a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "correspondent measures."
He said that Kim had told him that the "correspondent measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students undertake a course on taking enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has managed to make all its students who have not yet graduated to sleep with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture of studying all night and remaining awake thanks to caffeine.
Academic found that students at university in the first place in the world often do not have an idea about the real basic things about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after making a speech about the impact of sleep failure on learning.
"At the end a girl has been on me and said: "Why are they telling me this now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the essential things about how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a student’s sleeproom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell them the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance has an effect on sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine of sleep time.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged insomnia may increase the risks of heart attacks, seizures, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know – as much as you have the right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke cigarettes," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture that is proud to "be able to stay awake all night studying" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleeplessness was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you sleep enough, and of good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid increasing weight, as sleeplessness puts the brain in a famine mode, which famines them all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who is studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist for a course around the entire campus.
The next step, it hopes, is to ask all the graduates to undertake a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider making alarms for when they go to sleep, as well as when they get up, and know about the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can imbalance your circadian rhythm, leading to problems sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal hinders Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another sad period when playing abroad as the strike of Dolly Menga delivered Steven Gerrard to a loss of 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrax's side were looking for a record of their first victory while travelling from the February 4-1 trionfal win in St Johnstone, but Gary Hold's team only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 items as manager to leave his side eight points away from the large leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and the list of Rangers' players missing from inspiration never seemed to have reached.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third and only behind Hibernian on a glow difference.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after the linesman Camum Spence had to be treated for a wound in his head after an object was apparently hurled by the supporters of the team who played abroad.
Gerrard made eight changes on the Ayr side to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and was pleased with the way his well-trained form constantly impeded their opponents.
Rangers could have dominated the possession but Livingston made more with the ball they had.
Only two minutes from the beginning were to be made when Menga's first-time high-off sent Scott Pittman to a glow of Allan McGregor but the melliller took his great chance.
Strong free-kick of Keaghan Jacobs then found the skipper Craig Halett but his defender partner Alan Lithgow could only wipe out from behind.
Rangers gained control but it seemed that there is more hope than they believed about their game in the final third.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to have a penalty on the fifteen-minute mark as he and Steven Lawless hit but referee Steven Thomson ignored Komobjan's appeals.
Rangers managed to target well only two shutters in the first half of the item but the previous goalkeeper of Ibrax Liam Kelly barely worryd Lassana Coulibaly's head blow and the light strike of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's first glow in 34 minutes may have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that it deserved only their effort.
Once again, Rangers failed to manage a good set-pece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as soon as Declan Galagher dried the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to select Menga to complete the action.
Gerrard reacted to the brake by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided immediate impact as the winger dried in Morelos but the impressed Kelly got out of his line to block.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to play exactly the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halett that caught a long ball behind a long ball.
Holt's side could extend their position to the front in the final stages but McGregor kept well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow went open from the corner.
The alternate of Rangers Glenn Middleton had another late request for a penalty as he argued with Jacobs but again Thomson looked on the other side.
Almanak: Inventor of the Geiger Couple
And now a page from our Almanak of "Sunday Morning": 30th September, 1882, as today 136 years old, and I HAVE long to go ... the day on which future physics Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the equipment known as the Geiger Couple.
A science foundation since then, the Guest of Geiger has become a foundation of pop culture as well, as in the film of 1950 "Bells of Coronado," in which those cowboys scientists are unlikely to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "Did you what the dull is?"
Rogers: "The Geiger Contaminator, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these cuffs, you can actually hear the effects of atoms that give radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Say, surely it is popular now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he finished 63 years.
But the invention with his name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cells with abnormal behaviour and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour as part of treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are converted into a laboratory
These can then “see” a protein common to many cancers and then be re-injected.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour, has seen the cancer of her ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, they are changed in the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “driven the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and how to ‘teaching’ how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West Amel Attack Verbali Favur Trump, While he was wearing a Beritta of MAGA, After his appearance on SNL.
This Did Not Be Good
Kanye West was beaten in the studio during Saturday Night Live following a confusional performance in which the President of the United States Donald Trump praised and said he will stand for election in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, named Ghost Town in which he was wearing a beast of Make America Great, he began saying against the democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white person and tell me: "How can you please Trump, what racist?"
If I had been concerned about racism, I had left America," he said.
SNL started the programme with a discharge of the comedy in which Matt Damon appeared in which Hollywood star irrigated Brett Kavanaugh's declaration before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual attack claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West video is posted on social media by co-mediant Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to decorate you with West when it posted.
In addition, West had complained to the audience they had caught after the quinta about his blessing.
"Bubble me after the scenes.
He said, "do not go out with that liberality."
Browse me!
Then they say that lost," he said, according to Washington Explorer.
West continued: "Will you see the lost? and continue to say that I would "put on the cap of my superman, because this means that you cannot tell me what I do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try with love."
His comments triggered a bubbling at least twice by the audience and the SNL cast members appeared embarrassed, reported Varity, with one person there who said to the publication: "In all the studio a great silence fell."
West brought him as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend had, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West built many of the performances of the song I Love it, wearing as a Perrier Bottle.
West had support from the president of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous spirits: GRAZZS FOR LIVING THE FOLLA."
But the presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what he is and this is something beautiful mens."
"But I didn't choose to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe is taking up and spreading ideology that is harmful to my community.
It is free.
So much so we," she added.
Prior to the programme, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that it was now "what was previously known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The previous rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course the legend of music that is no longer with us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Game star of Thrones Kit Harington speaks of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role in naming the sword as Jon Snow in the series of violent medieval fantasy of HBO Game of Thrones.
But the actor, at 31 years of age, spoke about the stereotypes of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young men often feel that they need to be violent to respect.
Speaking with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed that "something went wrong" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his costle of Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, as well, admitted that he has "strong interests" to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel that I have a strong interest, currently--where we went wrong with masculinity?," he said.
"What were we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
A kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through its very male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the roads, that makes young men feel that they want to be this certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because it is very clear that something went wrong for the young man."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make preques or squares of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that "wars and horses".
Since November Kit will appear in Sam Shepard's new True West production which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently the actor revealed that he considered that meeting with his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this program, then in this way he gave me my future family, and my life from here on," he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygritte, the loving interest of the character of Kit, Jon Snow, in the series of fantasy that won in Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, say health officers.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 around 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health officers at a conference in the province of Yannan.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV from sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be common.
In view of the conservative values of the country, studies estimated that 70-90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that a staff member has revealed data from the senators of GOP, says "dangerous lies" and "confuse theories"
The United States Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff has posted the personal information of three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
Los Angeles' Democracy ensured that claims were being spread from " ultra-right side" foundations and websites.
"Gideb, lies and more lies to be done," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a session of the Senate's board on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nomination of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure was made some time after the three years interrogating Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Fundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the location source was associated with the office of Waters and released the information of a staff member of Waters, reported the Hill.
"This unfounded allegation is completely false and absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff member – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from the previous press secretary of White House Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is one of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that it does not have the temperament to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
It must not be resistant.
He shall not question the pleas in law of the accused.
It must be calm and seren."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's democrat, who was accused of the critics who seemed too angry during the Thursday sitting.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is going out to take the Waters' seat in the mid-term elections, also mentioned his voice on Twitter.
"This is something great if it is true," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned the "appropriate law enforcement authorities and bodies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that authors will be exposed," he continued, "and that they will be kept legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to each and all members of my staff."
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson, a healthless imitation of spy
It has become traditional now to look for Brexit's meanings in any new film with a British perspective and this seems applicable to the return of Johnny English's imitation event-commied back in 2003 by Johnny English and took life in 2011 by Johny English Reborn.
Would the ironic autosatira on the subject of how much we are obviously wrong, be the country's new export opportunity?
At any rate, the incompetent Johnny English with his eyes and moving face has not usually held the licence renewed for the second time to do everything wrong – that his name more than anything else shows that it is a widespread comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinema territory.
Of course, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims, has some of Clouseau's sweet attractiveness, a hit by Mr Bean and a large part of that man who contributed one note to the melody of the theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.
He is also originally based on the traveller and the international man of mystery who once Atkinson had made his part in the advertising of Barclaycard TV, today forgotten, after leaving chaos behind him.
There is a beautiful moment or two in this last issue of JE.
I liked the moment when Johnny English was approaching at an ellipothus while he was wearing medieval armoured clothing and the edges of the propellers caught up with his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy appears, but funnyism is quite poor and oddly overextraached, especially since the film-marks "serious" such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer comedy as a confident ingredient.
Humorism is felt as if it were aimed at children rather than adults, and for me the strange unfortunate incidents of Johnny English were not as inventive and focused as the intriguing film raft of Atkinson in the Perona of Bean.
The perennial topical proposition is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber Hacker filtered the very secret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the disappointment of the agent who was on work - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the cherry on the cake for the prime minister who is an imperious and difficult figure, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does its best with this character like Teresa May but there is not much in the script to work.
Its intelligence advisers inform it that every active spy has been compromised, they will have to get someone retired.
And this means the incompetent Johnny English itself, now employed as a teacher in an elegant building, but gives unofficial lessons about how to become an infiltrated operation: a few good ridicules here as English offers a school of Rock spiking academia.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his former patient partner, Bough, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, with a submarine commander, a role of an embarrassed one interpreted by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is little wasted.
The two inseparable, therefore, who always confuse everything in her Secret Service of Majesty, are back in action, when they meet the character of a beautiful, seducent woman Ophelia Bulletova interpreted by Olga Kursylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister falls under the rule of the billionary of sweet technology which claims that he can solve the problems of the British computer: the minister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey of fringe fun behavior: dress as waiters, fire a high French restaurant, create chaos to climb on the luxury yot of Volta; and English starts a full anarchy as he tries to use a cuffs of Virtual Reality to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Certainly all stops lead to that last sequence, but as friendly and as anonymous as it is, it has little idea of child television.
Something rather moderate.
And like the other films of Johnny English, I couldn't think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really deserves his talent?
Labour refuses to draw up a British plan for working a week of four days but paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see British working a week of four days – but paid for five.
The party has reportedly wanted the employer of the companies to pass on the residue that is produced by the artificial intelligence revolution (CA) to the workers by giving them another day of savings.
This would see the employees enjoying a three-day weekend – but they still take the same pay with them.
Sources said that the idea would be "wrong" with the party's economic agenda and plans that the country would turn in favour of the workers.
The changeover to a week of four days was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior official of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen overnight but a four-day working week is an aspiration that is appropriate to the party's approach to rebalance the worker's economy as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party that promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the aspiration is currently not being approved by the Party of Labour as a whole.
A speaker for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a party's policy and the party is not considering it."
The Chancellor of Opposition John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "those who profit" in utility firms.
The opposition canceller plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back all their share as a Labour government can make "reduction" on the basis of perceived misconduct.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 percent of private sector firms' equity to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their understanding of them
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by a week, and raises the question as to whether the findings of the bureau could influence any Republican senator from withdrawing his support.
In an interview that was announced on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their understanding.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague than South Carolina.
"Lear, and surely," said Kennedy.
"I said and enter the sitting, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
Did I call him after this happened, after that allegation was issued, I said, "Make her?"
He was resolved, determined, inecwovic."
However, Graham's vote seems difficult to change.
"I have already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and must be a very great accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it strongly," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And every person you mention can't verify it.
It is 36 years old.
I haven't seen anything new to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Do Some Things to Reduce Poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a very impressive list of stars that will be seen and an equally impressive mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now, in his seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people free for the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sherm Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real aim of the event ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Governance Project, a representation group with the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless I was willing to pay a VIP ticket), the concerters had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or other significant ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen for the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people free of charge is a genuine way to persuade people to ask for a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" – people feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which has insisted for a number of different objectives.
It states that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion that are expected to affect lives of over 2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements from its actions, at least $10 billion of which were already disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that secure funds have so far made a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the diagnosis.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "enable children to grow to their full potential," with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help put an end to malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweet from Global Citizens.
"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of denutrition a footnote in history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracky Ullman to the crowd at a direct concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on his website to ask "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard trip – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements of civil rights and against the apartheid, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Sherna Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, who will present Desorb-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US uses Naval Fleet for "block up" to disrupt Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington could have recourse to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, revealed the US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Explorer.
Zinc alleged that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it is operating with a legitimate government invitation - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe," he allegedly said.
And, depending on the official, there are ways and means of addressing it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Naval Fleet, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not reached the market," he said.
Zinc was addressing those who attended the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that invites itself as the "energy consumer voice" in the US.
It continued to compare Washington's approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is, to a lesser extent, fuel leverage and substitution," he said, referring to Russia as "one-stopper" with an economy dependent on carbon fuels.
The claims come as the administration of Trump was on a mission to strengthen its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the administration of Trump, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to exit the "unappropriate" gas-deducted project Nord Slovakia 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "sir" of Moscow.
Moscow stressed on many occasions that the Nord Straam gasde 2 of $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing gasgrid capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister for Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main organisation for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), invited the US to stay away from Europe's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Escape Well" Whether to Go Out for President in 2020, Says the Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren, on Saturday, said he will "examine us well" whether he will stand for a president following the mid-term elections.
During a meeting of the council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed to consider issuing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and this includes a woman in the highest position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will examine whether I will go out for a president."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the council meeting, saying that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was directed at Trump's criticism and his nomination for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a weekend, Warren said "of course we need an investigation of the FBI before voting."
However, a Thursday survey showed that a majority of Waren's own constituents do not think that it should be elected in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters of Massachusetts said that the senator should not come out for election, according to the survey of the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the issue for the election.
The survey showed more support for the election release by the former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent that supported a potential election issue and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic Names discussed in relation to potential election release of 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he officially decides by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin refers to the PTSD of Track Palain at Donald Trump manifestation
Track Palin, 26 year old, spent one year in Iraq after having been registered in September
He was arrested and presented on an incident of domestic violence on Monday's night
"What my son is going through, what is going through after he returned, I can relate to other families who feel the ramifications of the PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with," said the audience in a manifestation for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklamoma.
Palin called his arrest as "the obvious problem that no one is addressing" and said about her son and other war veterans, "they return a little different, return stronger, let us think whether there is that respect for what other soldiers like and air personnel, and any other member of the military, gave to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Basilla, Alaska, and was presented on a domestic violence attack on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and weapon possession while he was xurban, according to Dan Bennett, a speaker for the Wasila Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support a challenge for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge for a new United States policy to deny asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district, Friday presented a court friend's case in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the actor in the case of Grace against Genders brought forward by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said that her partner "and the boys children members of his violent gang," abused it but the US officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
It was held in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations face pervasive problems with domestic gangs and violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a decision of 2014 by the Migrants' Board of Appeals which allowed unaccompanied immigrants to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday, in a statement, the Advocate General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said that the new policy "failing decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum claims to be judged on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a motive infringes this principle, said the case of a court friend.
The lawyers continued to argue in the case that the policy that refuses income for immigrants is damaging to the United States economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
He is responsible for the violent repression against the civilian population.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Genders said in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- people face every day around the world.
Desired rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths doubles in the fight against time to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly terrible.
"I feel very intense," said a 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, while she was nurturing her child with fever in an evacuation centre in the unfortunate city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
The residents appeared to return to their homes destroyed, looking for their things flooded with water, trying to save everything they could find.
Several hundred people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the 7.5-sized earthquake, were too full.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures in his back and shoulders, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside because of continued strong shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he related that he felt the violent earthquake moved the hotel land on the fifth floor that he was using with his wife and daughter.
"There was no chance to save ourselves.
I was crushed with the remains of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, and added that his family was in place for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they are safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda adverts"
One week later an official Chinese newspaper issued a four-page advertisement in a US newspaper that comes out every day trying to sell the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador for China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China Daily's paid supplement in Des Moines Register - the newspaper that is most sold in the state of Iowa - after accusing China that it is seeking to intervene in US congress elections on 6 November, accusing China to reject it.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in a campaign to scale up from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make adverts to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently fixed in a trade war that is escalating that they have seen tariff rounds on imports of each of them.
The Chinese retaliation fees at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador for China and the former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods for China, said Beijing hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad on an opinion page at Des Moines Register Sunday, "now doubles thisbullying by making propaganda adverts in our own free picture."
"In the spread of its propaganda, the government of China is using America's dear tradition of free expression and free press by placing a paid advert in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, on the newspaper stand down on the road here in Beijing, you will find voices of limited dissemination and you will not see a true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people can have on China's problematic economic trajectory, since the media is found under a restriction of the Chinese communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans Are Aliening the Women Votants Prior to the Mid-Term Elections by the Cavanaugh Debate, Alerting the Analists
As many top Republicans support and defend the nominations of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh while facing several allegations of sexual attack, analysts have warned that they will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the next mid-term elections.
Emotions on this were very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to lead by vote.
These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Syracuse University Maxwell School to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that the contempt of the last minute of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an investigation by the FBI will be enough to calm down angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speakers for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C...
On Friday morning, the demonstrators sang "November come!" as they protested in the Senate hall as the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to lead with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's declaration, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high, said St. Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst to the news site.
"People are saying they have already been high; and true.
"But they may be higher, particularly between female voters who convert votes into suburbs and smaller voters, 18 to 29 years old, who while the president does not please, often do not vote."
As a former Government Minister, shares responsibility for the regime's violent repression against the civilian population.
"This became a full confusion for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This concerns not only the committee vote or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is placed on the bank, it also concerns the way the Republicans handled this situation and how it dealt with it," indicated to the news station Guy Cecil, director of Prioritys USA, a group that helps to elect the Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided in some way over believers in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely believed or probably the Ford declaration, while 35 percent said they definitely believed or probably the Ford declaration.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lies during his declaration, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations put forward by Ford as well as at least another accusers, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford spoke before the Judicial Committee of the Senate on oath last week that Kavanaugh while he was a shipwrecked at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nomination of the Supreme Court exposed his genitals to her while they were in festin when studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor plans to Start a New Internet to Compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business that seeks to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Open Source Platform, Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee clarified that the intention behind Inrupt is a "domination of the world."
"We must do it now," he said about new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their "personal online data shop" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of what should be done, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify have all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes the personal online data shop unique is that it is entirely up to the user to access which type of information.
The company calls this "personal automation through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is that the company brings adequate resources, process skills and skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM security platform, some contract staff developers to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
By starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google as to whether they should introduce a complete change where all their business models turn down from today to tomorrow.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a place on a Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid.'
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when setting up a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic for this next web era," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Cleric celebrity of World War I Cross Victoria
The only clergy of the Church of England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as combatants was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
Lt Kur Il-Reverend Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 at the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he won the highest British military honor.
Saturday a commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandchildren in a parate in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that he was "symbolic in a brilliant way" that the stone should be revealed exactly 100 years after the winning of his grandpa's prize.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 the Lt Kur led his battle across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in many mist and fire from rifles on the ground and machine guns."
Later he hurried to the fireline and with the "greater courage" led the line forward before he went to a rifle on the spot alone and lost their senses three of the bow.
The Lt Kur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never get there but something very humiliating."
Dr James Vann and his brother also put a girland behind the parate, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was feeling very honoured to play a role in this parate" and added "the courage of genuine heroes was shown by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA supporters remained awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead of finishing with Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you have remained awake all night to see Bellator 206 packed to end up denying you to see the main event.
The list from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were being shown direct overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised when the broadcast changed to Peppa Big.
Some were not impressed after they had remained awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
One party on Twitter described the switch to children's card as "some kind of goff ridicule."
"It is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate therefore had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, a superior vice-president of Bellator's marketing and communication, when asked about transmission.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
The president of Belator Scott Coker said that they will work on their scheduling to include future UK viewers.
"I think that when I think about the repetition, we can probably arrange something," said Coker.
"But now there they are the sixth morning of Sunday and we will not be able to arrange until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
Emmini, when the broadcast was over, there were many messages going on and not all were sweet.
We were trying to correct the solution, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it was not, it was a governmental issue.
I can promise that the next time you will not happen.
We will limit it to five struggles instead of six – as we do usual – and we have tried to lead more to supporters and go too much.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "ferred" because of sexuality
Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said that he had not realized until he went to the secondment that "not everyone like me."
Speaking on the first defines Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent he became less concerned than the Olympics won.
The regular presenter of the ongoing programme, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of illness.
While it appeared as a person set aside on Laverne's first programme, Daley said that he felt "less than" others as they grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to like you boys and girls."
He said: "To date, those emotions that feel less than, and feel different, were the real things that gave me the power and strength to be able to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, not to disappoint everyone when they eventually come to know about his sexuality.
The twice-dong Olympic medalist has become a high-profile promoter for LGBT and has used his appearance in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to de-crime homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt fortunate that he could live freely without ramifications and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world winner for three times said that when he came to love a man - a US film producer Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "was surprised" for him.
Daley married Oscar's winner, 20 years older than it, last year but said that the age gap was never a problem.
"When he goes through so many things at such a young age – he went to his first 14-year-old Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later – he said that it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar beautiful and bad experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "all perspective" had changed.
"If I asked me last year, for me the importance was to 'I want to win a golden medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things greater than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 40 years after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the things he had asked was if he had already had tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you'll not be here to be in the front row, pà'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and was not until when he actually stopped breathing and was dead who finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that this was what I dreamed all my life--to dive in front of a crowd from countries in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the first choice of his song - a Province of Heater Small - which was compatible with him in the walk to the Olympics and still flies the cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson which is no longer in form remains on the bank at the Ryder Cup Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Saturday when it plays his 47 Ryder Cup game, but will have to change its shape to avoid being an important not so cheerful step.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for a record of 12 times, remained on the bank by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being the centre of action, as was often for the United States, the great winner of five times shared his day between supporting and working on his game from the distance with the hope of rectifying his concerns.
One who never gave the ball right even in the fullness of his career, the 48-year-old husband is not ideal for the difficult course of Le Gulf National, where the long distance once again punishes wrong shuts.
And if the course alone is not enough, Mickelson, in the 9th game on Sunday, faces the exact British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, new for the season, to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with four points less than the beginning of the 12 single games, start well, the game of Mickelson can show that it is a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say something else.
"He fully understood the role that he played today, opting at his back and put his arm around me and said he will be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"We have much confidence in itself.
He Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
Likely I didn't see him playing two parties.
I saw more, but this is the way it worked and this is the way we thought it will go.
He must be there outside, like others."
Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record for the most successful Ryder Cup items on Sunday.
This can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has not reached the fillings of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, although Furyk said that his presence brought a few intangible things to the team.
"He sounds you, sarcastic, funny, dries with people, and a very good man to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players have enjoyed criticizing him, this week, which was something fun to see.
He provides much more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn that the high position in the front can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a large front position taken before the last day's singles at the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into a uncomfortable journey.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a side led by Save Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans but ended up with a very narrow margin, with a win of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It continues to remind yourself that we had a large front position in Valderrama; we had a large front position in Brookline, where we lost, and Valderrama, where we won, but with little," said Bjorn, in the press, after seeing the 2018 Class wins 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to be on a worship with 10-6 in Le Gulf National.
So the story will show me and everyone in this unfinished team.
Tomorrow goes with your soul and body.
Take out and do all things good.
It is not yet complete until you have brought the points on the team.
We have a goal, and what he tries to hide this trophy, and the focus will remain there.
I always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know well what the other side is – the biggest players in the world."
Content with how his players played on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "Never do I go a step beyond me in this.
A different challenge remains.
It still concerns the individual performances we see, and this is something different to do.
Very beautiful to be outside with a partner when things are going well, but when there are out individually, then you will be tested for your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you want to pass on to players, which issues your best tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner behind you and he wants to leave and get out of his best, also."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with the exceptions that are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who acquired three points out of four.
Furyk itself was on both sides of those last days that could change everything, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before it was lost as Europe made the "Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember to the least word of it," he said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the master in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"We still have 12 important items, but want it to come to that start quickly as I saw it in Brookline, as I saw it in Medinah.
When it comes to that one side momentum, put a lot of pressure on those middle items.
We have drawn up our list properly and put those men in the way we felt, you know, we are trying to perform a few miracles tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight back and face Roy McIllroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the best half of the order.
"I went with this group of men in this way because I think it covers all the way," said Bjorn on his singles choices.
Germany's new war postponed again
The newest German Naval Fleet race was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the ageing Cold War fragates, but there will be at least until next year due to systems with difficulties and increasing cost, reported local media.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main new flaming freezer vessel of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a speaker for the military.
The vessel had to join the Naval Fleet in 2014, but the problem post-delivery issues raised the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships that ordered the Naval Fleet back in 2007 will come as a substitute for ageing Bremen class refrigerators.
It is understood that they will have a strong cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile exhibition as well as some cautious technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic singers.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods – this should be possible to operate the newest refrigerators up to two years away from home ports.
However, a continuous delay means that the vessels of the latest technology – which mentioned above allow Germany to project offshore power – will already be old by the time they enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
The frigate F125 of bad misfortune appeared in the news last year, when the German Naval Fleet officially refused to commission the vessel and returned to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Naval Fleet returned a vessel to a shipbuilder after it led.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but the German media quoted a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the vessel useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workers on the older bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appeared that the vessel is severely overweight to reduce its performance and limit the ability of the Naval Fleet to add future updates.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is understood to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the whole project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a shocking amount of €3.1billion ($3.6bn) – out of the initial €2.2bn.
The problems of the most newcomers become especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Naval Fleet currently "has a lack of vessels to withstand deployment."
The official said that the problem has grown over time, because old ships have been commissioned but replacement vessels have not been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class refrigerators could join the Naval Fleet.
National Trust is mentioned on the secret life of bats
New research on land in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when they seek food.
It is hoped that the findings will show a new light on the behaviour of unique mammals that fly and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pipistrelles and superno as well as brown bats with long ears and Daubenton at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in major locations around the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of all recording sounds will ascertain the frequency of bat calls and which species is doing what.
A habitat map will then be produced and a report that will create a detailed picture of the scale of their behaviour landscape.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of pastures and how best to maintain woodland for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has decreased considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from building and development work affecting habitats’ nests and loss.
Wind turbines and lights may also pose a risk, such as poison paper to capture insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not currently blind.
However, because of their notorna game traditions their ears are more useful than their eyes when they come to capture prey.
They use sophisticated ecolocation techniques to indicate insects and obstacles in their passage when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organisation has even established the first and only reserve of Scotland's bats in the Threave land in Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of the 10 species of School bats.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a very good area for the bats," said he.
"We have the old building, many veteran trees and all good habitat.
But there is much more about the bats that are not yet known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what we need to flourish."
It stresses the importance of checking bats for the maintenance of properties as it is possible that an unintended destruction of a single maternity nest can kill up to 400 women and the young, possibly destroy a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to breeze them or to disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Conservation Trust of the Nightlife, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have much to learn about our bats and for most of our species we do not yet know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape as lawyers are ready to seek a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo pointed out rape claims against him as "falter news," saying that people "must promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are expected to seek court in the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published allegations.
Portugal's front player Juventus was accused of rapeting an American woman, named Kathhryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He alleged that on that day he had paid it $375,000 to not say anything about the accident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on a video on Instagram Live with his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, remarked the reports as "falter news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said Ballon d'Or's winner five times while looking in the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They must become famous to say my name, but this is part of the work.
I'm a happy man and everything is doing well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo lawyers are preparing to court search for Der Spiegel about allegations, which they called "inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Dr Christian Schertz said that the player seeks compensation for "moral damage in an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged accident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Castino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayotte allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped it from the anus, according to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorca insists that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged accident and told her that it was "99 percent" "a good man" disappointed by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both were sexually related, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorca also insists that she went to the police and took pictures of her hospital injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because she felt "went by retaliation" and was worried that he would be "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says that she is now seeking to switch the solution as she is being traumatised by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer followed the Italian football legends Juventus in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "worry forever" lost car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "I regret it forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was a "concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer claimed that the impact of border delays in the case of Brexit of no agreement would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes up Auris and Avensis of Toyota - produced almost 150,000 cars last year from which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a stop in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini plant for one month after Brexit.
The main concern relates to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit of no agreement.
Toyota's production line works today on a "exact in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for orderly cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be border barriers that industry claims could lead to delays and deficiencies of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain an inventory of more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production would be stopped.
Mr Clark says that the Chequers of Theresa May plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that allows, as I say, not only success to enjoy at present but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we need absolutely to be able to continue what was a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say for how long production was stopped, but in a longer period, warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the convenor of the Unite union at the plant, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs leave, they never return.
A Spokesperson for the government said: "We have submitted an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The risky meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed by another week" as the fight continues on the nomination of the supreme court Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House on Sunday.
In taking on and acting in this capacity, he has therefore actively supported actions and policies which undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, and further destabilised Ukraine.
Whether Trump will dismiss the deputy lawyer-general or not, thus endangering Mueller's independence, a shouting Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wire clothing to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25 amendments.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, although there were reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, which at the time was the United Nations in New York, scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said that he "does not prefer" to expel Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid being disgraced with the hearing of theuguated judicial committee of the Senate in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom gave their testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered FBI to carry out an investigation of claims against Kavanaugh over a period of one week, which delayed further full voting of the Senate.
On Sunday, the press secretary of Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "It has not yet been set a date for this, it may be that this week, and it may be held the following week because of all other things going on with the supreme court.
But now we see and I always like to keep the picture up to date".
Some journalists contest this claim: Sanders has not organised a press meeting at the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "to try to attract and influence the audience", although he said: "Although I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the picture would increase.
"The president holds further sessions of Questions and Answers compared to any former president," she added without mentioning any evidence: "We look at those numbers."
The meetings will still continue to be held, said Sanders, but "if the picture has the chance to ask questions to the US president directly, this is far better than he spoke to me.
We try to do this a lot and have seen us do this many times in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump rarely answers questions when leaving the White House or when participating in open sessions or press conferences when visiting the dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves in a relaxed and sometimes strange manner in front of groups of journalists.
The health secretary writes to the EU workers in NHS Scotland about the fears related to Brexit
The Health Secretary wrote to the EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the gratitude and desire of the country that they remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter when less than six months are left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to entering into the cost of applications of a defined status for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue continued, moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government was also increasing its preparations for a possible scenario of no agreement.
I know that this is certainly an unstable time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to support me now how much I value each staff member's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Couples across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and I wish you very much to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Makes Emergency Surgery After Suffering Injury in Rasu
The linebacker Christion Abercrombie of the Tennessee State Tigers carried out emergency surgery after having suffered an injury at his head on Saturday when his team lost against the Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State's main coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
"He went on the sideline and like fell there," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing it on a stretcher and taking it on the back for further examination.
An official from the State of Tennessee told the WSMV Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was no longer being operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that "to date there is no detail on the type/extent of injury" and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the second year of the suspended university, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after leaving Illinois.
On Saturday all he had five tackles before leaving the game, which led to the total of 18 taccles of his season.
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more stamp tax when purchasing property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more stamp tax when purchasing property in the UK with extra money used to help homeless people under new Tory plans
This change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tax will be levied on non-tax-payers in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects this to rise up to £120 million a year - to help homeless people
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers should pay a higher rate of stamp tax when buying property in the UK - with extra money used to help homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-wage earners.
The increase in stamp tax will be imposed on non-taxable individuals and firms in the UK, with extra money boosting Government efforts to fight road sleep.
The additional charge - which is additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second houses and rental purchases - can be three percent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to £120 million a year.
Around 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, which are increasing prices and thus becoming more difficult for new buyers to make a first step in the purchasing phases of accommodation.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "fantamous cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time abroad.
The new policy came out just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp tax so that more young people would be helped to buy their first home.
He accused the big construction firms that they were keeping the prices of the property high by seizing the land and not using it, and urged Ms May to abandon quotas on affordable homes in order to correct the "hummy housing situation" in the United Kingdom.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed reforms of accommodation that hit the eye, including checks on rent and the end of "no faults".
He also wants to give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: "I said last year that I will devote my post to returning the UK dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And this means correcting the broken market of our accommodation.
The UK will always remain open to people who want to live, work and acquire their lives here.
However, it is not fair for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to find it as easy to buy homes as busy UK residents.
For many people the dream of having a house has become too distant, and the indignity of sleep on the streets remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
The head of Sunderland Jack Ross says that his "fundamental ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland one day.
Slovakia, aged 42, welcomes the challenge of reviving the North-East club, currently in third place in League One, with three points different from that in first place.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for countries as player.
I've got B cap and nothing more," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sports Sound.
"But when I was still a child, I would often go with my father to see Scotland playing in Hampden, and this is always the thing that attracted me back.
However, this opportunity only comes if I succeed in managing a club."
Those who came before Ross as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allirdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Atthletic says that he did not worry about the fact that he would follow such established names in such a large club, while previously rejecting the offer from Barnsley City and Ipswich.
"At now, success for me will be based on "you can again deliver this Premier League club?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It is not easy for this to come there, but I probably consider that I have succeeded here only if I can take the club back there."
Ross has been only three years in his career as manager, after a period of assistant head in Dumbarton and after spending 15 months with Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third category, transforming St Mirren from the edge of the relegation to winners of the title of the Championship in the following season.
And Ross says that he is now feeling more comfortable than he felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
As regards when he took Alloa in his hands, he recalled that "It was probably a big change."
"I really thought that the post of manager was the most appropriate one for me, much more than that of player.
This may sound strange by doing well, having a decent living, and having benefited from some reasonable achievements.
But games can be difficult.
There are many things you have to go through each week.
I still experience this in terms of stress and labour pressure but simply feel that the post of manager is suitable for me.
I always wanted to manage and now do this, and I feel that all my adult life is now feeling the most comfortable."

Survey finds that the best time to take a beer pint is at 5.30pm in the evening
The summer heat wave boosted the earnings of the UK pubs in difficulty but put more pressure on the restaurants of the same company.
In July, the groups of pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales – but figures revealed that restaurant earnings fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, an advisory CGA for businesses, who collected the figures, said: "A continuous trend and the longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even more.
The 1.8 percent fall in the restaurant business in June was further exacerbated in July.
The pubs and bars whose main sales are beverages were the ones most well-performing in terms of the financial results compared to the previous period while the sales of restaurants decreased.
Pubs whose main sale is food have also suffered in heat, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people simply wanted to get out of drink.
In the pubs and bars managed the sale of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food fell to three per cent."
Paul Newman, one of the analysts of RSM with regard to entertainment and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remain the largest factors in terms of sales in the take-away market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a reduction in sales of 4.8 percent a year after a year will be particularly burdensome in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The hot and long summer could not come in any worse time for operators whose main sale is food and only time could advise us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much needed rest."
The growth of total sales in pubs and restaurants, including start-ups, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the downturn in start-ups.
According to the UK authorities, the market share of the US producers in the UK market is around [...] %, and the market share of the US producers in the UK is around [...] %.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents
Survey reveals that one in five children - some of them at the young age of 11 - have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers
The study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the "Insta folz" pages
News has large fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "key" account to show their parents
One in five children - some of them at the young age of 11 - are creating social media accounts that hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in the "Insta’s follow" accounts – a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
News has large fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate an present "key" account to show their parents, while having private ones.
A mother who met the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a young man who was encouraging others to rape her - "suppressed me."
Research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmipsies' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of whom admit to keep private accounts.
The head of the HMC Mike Buchan said: "It is worrying that many young people are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will become the "voice for athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletes
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletes' board as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most athlete of the racecourse and not of the racecourse that won most medals and president Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from its vast experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is very respected in the Scottish athletic community, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athlete in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead sport in Scotland."
The American, which won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta among its total of four Olympic Games gold medals and is now regular BBC critics, ended up not following a small stroke.
On Twitter he wrote: "As for today a month you give me a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said that only time can we advise whether I recover or not or to what extent.
It was a hard work but I have recovered completely, I learned how to renaissance and today I am conducting agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Breast pump advertisement comparing mothers with cows gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to different opinions online with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers with cattle being slurred.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered to be "the world's first safe and wearable chest pump", the consumer's technology company Elvie issued a advertisement inspired by an iron music video to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers who use the chest pump.
Four real mothers dance in a mom filled with the straw of cows with a disc that includes a lyric such as: "Yes, I hide myself but do not have a tail" and "In the event that I have not noticed these are not a spider but a breast."
The chorus continues: "Poppy out, pumping out, I am feeding my babies, pumping out, pumping out, I am mourning my wives."
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 spectators and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, many of which say it sheds light on the "terrors" of the dairy industry.
Someone wrote "It was a very bad decision that cows are used to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken to them within a few days of giving birth".

Someone else commented: "One understands that this is a traumatic thing for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Reclaim really cut off from reality."
Others defended the advertisement, with a woman admitting that she found the disc "very diverse."
"I think this is a genial idea.
If I were still sucked, I would buy one.
The pumping made me feel the same as a cow.
The advertisement is just or too paradise, but I've taken it.
This is a genial product," wrote someone.
Someone else commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often on their places of work or in toilets) and feel like "cattle".
This is not a advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they were all dancing with pumps that did not give in to the eye placed in their brass.
The concept behind the countryside is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump, does not make any noise, has no wire or tube and fits in a breast-feeding bra without giving in to the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even come out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD in Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a courageous and provocative launch.
By placing women using the breast pump with the dairy cows we wanted to focus on the pumping of the breast and all the challenges it poses, while showing fun and related to it, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump appeared on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Mothers of Migrant Children Moved Without Word to a Texas Border Tracking Camp
The number of migrant children detained has increased strongly although border crossings per month have remained largely unchanged, partly because rhetorics and harsh policies introduced by the administration of Trump have made it more difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that presenting themselves to care for a child would jeopardise their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their poultry would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested tens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the household of sponsors are found here in the country illegally, many of whom are foreign criminals.
So we continue to look for these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials have introduced new rules which will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through a video telephone conference, instead of personally, in order to bring arguments in their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those considered ineligible for aid will be immediately deported.
According to sheltered workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the more children are kept in custody, they are more likely to become anxious or distressed, which may lead to violent expression or attempting to escape.
Lawyers said that these concerns would increase in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where it is more likely to ignore signs that a child is finding it difficult, given the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving enough time to prepare emotionally or without saying strength to their peers can lead to trauma many of which are already fighting.
Syria tells the U.S., France and Turkey "extreme forces" to immediately withdraw
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war now being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory, with the pretext of the fight against terrorism, and "will be properly addressed."
"They shall withdraw immediately and without any condition," said the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism almost come to an end" in Syria, where since 2011 more than 360,000 people have died, with millions being moved from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "to fight this sacred battle until we are expelled from all Syrian territories" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has around 2,000 truples in Syria, many of which train and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 truples in the land in the country destroyed by war.
As regards the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good for them to return, and it blamed "in some Western countries" for "switching irrational fears" that led refugees to keep away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last strong major rebel created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by the Syrian Russian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target the stakers including the fighters from the Al-Qaeda Front, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to convene shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and of the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be restricted "to the review of the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Mandate
With this logic, Mr Trump will win the re-election in 2020 provided that, as many liberal viewers hope, the denunciation and the scandal terminate his presidency prematurely.
What would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic finale ever in a presidency!"
So far, it seems that viewers have not yet been satisfied.
Since 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million of four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Massow Show" has increased cable television ratings by even 3.5 million viewers in the main news nights.
"This is a situation that is attracting people to it because it is not something we understand," said Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC drama programme "Designed Survivor", about a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, writer of the veteran comedys and author of "just the Funny Parties: And a Few Hard Trues About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Why do you tell me," said Mrs. Scovell.
In this chaos there is a value of entertainment.
Undoubtedly, contrary to anything else on TV, the stories titles from Washington can determine Roe v. Wade's future, if immigrants' families can reunite and the strength of the global economy.
To ignore what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And however, this goes beyond being an informed citizen when in six you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of "deep background" sourceing for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's leather bomber's jacket ("brief clothing"" with a value of $15,000 and the implications of the descriptions of the anatomy of Mr Trump's anatomy by Stormy Daniel.
For example, I will never look again at Super Mario in the same way.
"A part of what he is doing is as if this is a realty show is that every night he is bringing you something," said Brent Montgomery, executive chief of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing cast and the development in the day-to-day plot of the Trump programme (fight with N.F.L., praise to Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to lose one episode because you otherwise fall behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, his home was sunshine at 80 degrees on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside see MSNBC while recording the CNN.
It could not have come from before television, not when Brett Kavanaugh was ready to face the Judicial Committee of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when we used to make those excellent programmes before and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was some ridicule, but in truth they had reason."

Large amounts of money received from outside for the most stringent races in the mid-term election of the White House
It is not surprising that the seventeen congressional district of Pennsylvania is seeing a large amount of money, thanks to a realignment of congressional districts that have acquired two operators in a race for the same chair.
This recently re-established Pittsburg suburban district peats the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is appearing as a candidate against another operator, Republican Keith Rothfus, which currently represents the twelve old district of Pennsylvania, which extends greatly over the seventeenth new district.
The maps were re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were oppressed in an anti-institutional manner in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the seventeen new districts has provoked a difficult competition of the financial campaign between the main party's finance weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning a little difference in the March special election followed a lot for the eighteenth Congressal District of Pennsylvania.
That chair was of Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political critics gave Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered penalising El Salvador for supporting China, then Deciding not to do so
The Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump held a successful meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and had a hotel in Panama until some partners dismissed the administrative team of the Organization of Trump.
The officials of the State Department decided to contact again the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "recent decisions to stop recognising Taiwan," said the speakers of the Heather Nauert department, in a declaration at the beginning of this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received around $140 million in American aid, including narcotic controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial assistance and restrictions on targeted visa, would be burdensome for the Central American country and its high unemployment and killing rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year which was seen as a step forward in efforts not to move migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, the officials of the highest administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with the aim of effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was strongly criticised to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration places on the meeting, said diplomats.
And the three Americans sent back quietly back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and hard message or punishment from Washington.
A White House speaker, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke of the condition of anonymity.
History Study
The next unexpected negative event could be the report of the special consultant Robert Mueller on the possible disruption of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
He is reported that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in her attack on our elections.
In the event that Congress passes to another person, Mr Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as soon as he prepares to return to the voters, and perhaps a jury of his peers.
This involves many uncertainties, and I do not aim to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of his equivalent in Europe.
There are options to be made by all on both sides of the Atlantic which will affect the extent of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a d'état coup against Hitler, had the West resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakis in Munich.
We did not succeed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history is around such points of inflection, and the inexorable path of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today the Americans face many of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Mr Trump dismisses Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rosensein has been in problems since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be recorded secretly and speculately that it is not suitable for the post.
Mr Rosenstein said that the report by The Times is inaccurate.
"How will we answer if the investigation of F.B.I. asked Brett Kavanaugh to be incomplete or just – or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual conduct and dishonest witnesses?
And above all, in the middle terms will we vote for a Congress that will keep Mr. Trump responsible?
If we do not pass these tests, it will take time for democracy to move.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson that I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the house of my ambassadors.
She managed to live, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship, God sent me to turn the candle on that table with swatics.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic before the competitive game with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against Austrians, following the impressive equal outcome brought in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the equal result of 2-2 with Villarreal but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for great things.
"This was a good point for us since Villarreal are a good team," said the 31st year old boy.
"We entered the game with the belief that we could get something and issued us with a point.
We were probably able to win it towards the end but, overall, an equal result was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Thursday will be a great European evening again.
We hope we can achieve three points but this will be difficult because they have had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can continue to do our best and achieve a positive result.
Last year it was certainly difficult, between all that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but despite this there is currently a sense of positiveness.
The team is good and boys are enjoying great pleasure; training is being good.
I hope that we will now be able to do our best, forget the last season and succeed."
Women worry about this fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be supervised, few people were talking to their family members about this.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said that they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
"People want to be a family member who cares for them, but they are not taking steps to make a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
You should start this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes well prematurely.
Work with your adviser and your family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, as those options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial advisor: Your consultant can also help you to find a way to pay for those costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy with a hybrid cash value in order to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth - provided you have money.
Make a decision after discussing your legal documents in the long term: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare proxy to select a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider a proxy for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan for you to be ready.
"They are not only the finances that are involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will care for the dog?
See that plan to be completed."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, said officials, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
These are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, about the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a region that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of the coast in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The management, an administrative region under province, had a population of around 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central Province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moroal, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also struck the west side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh province of Indonesia in the northern part of Sumatra hit a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
As a former Government Minister, shares responsibility for the regime's violent repression against the civilian population.
2006: Terremot with a power of 6.8 struck the south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, which has triggered a tsunami that has hit the southern coast very strongly, killing almost 700 people.
2009: Terremot with a strength of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital city of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: Terremot with a power of 7.5 struck one of the islands of Mentawai, beyond Sumatra, which triggered a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low terror struck Pidie Jaya's registrar in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the earthquake and of the fatal tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 were killed because of a building that collapsed.
2018: Large terrors hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the top of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
The Greater Child of Sarah Palin Arrested on Accuses of Domestic Violence
Place of Birth: a) Kafia Kingi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, b) Kafia Kingi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, c) Kafia Kingi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, d) Kafia Kingi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, e) Kafia Kingi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, g) Kafia Kingi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, g) Kafia Kingi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, g) Kafia Kingi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, g) Kafia Kingi, Democratic Republic
Palin, aged 29, from Wassila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, who intervened in a report of domestic violence and who resisted arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when female consulates tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took the phone from her hand.
Palin is held in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held on an unsecured $500 bond, reported the KTUU.
He appeared the court on Saturday, declaring himself "certainly, not guilty" when he was asked to give his motive, reported the network.
Palin is facing three Class A crimes, i.e. he can hold prison for up to one year and has to pay a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of a Class B crime, which is punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been made against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of an attack on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called on the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of a domestic attack, which intervened in the report of a crime of domestic violence, and which held a weapon in his possession while he was a xurban in connection with the accident.
His girl alleged that her blow with a ponne in her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by the veteran groups following a comparison between her child's violent behaviour and the post-rheumatic stress (PTSD) disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-powered earthquake hit a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not operational with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit only slightly outside the centre of Sulawesi located in the north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Videos showing the moment of impact are circulating on the media.
Thousands of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great strength.
Federal Prosecutors are requesting that the suspect of the terrorist attack of NYC be given a rare death penalty
The federal prosecutors in New York are asking that Sayfullo Saipov who is suspected in the terrorist attack of the city of New York that killed eight people will be sentenced to death - a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, who is 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a track for bicycles along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, by in October having a cotton to pedestrians and cyclists who flowed on his way.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to the notice on the intention to claim the death penalty, presented in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two heads of charge carry a possible death penalty with them.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury gave Saipov 22 chief of the charge that included eight charges of killing with the help of an organized relapse, typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Describing the way in which Saipov carried out this attack "patent, cruel and immoral", the prosecutors said that the attack required substantial "pre-planning and meditation."
The notice of intent states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnacco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York has last fled a case of death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was committed in a federal case of New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being convicted of conspiration to carry out an espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, said the police.

He also asked that in his hospital room a flag of the ISIS be placed, said the police.
He answered not guilty of the 22nd head of the accusation.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they are "certainly disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction for life in prison with no possibility of deliverance will only extend the trauma of these events to anyone involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team previously asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
The MP Toory states that NIGEL FAAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former Leader of the Ukip said that the politicians had to "be feeling under pressure" by the Eurosceptics – as suggested by one of the MPs of Theresa May itself that he should be responsible for the negotiations with the EU.
The member of the Government of the Conservative Party Peter Bone told the demonstration in Birmingham that so far the United Kingdom "had gone out" had Mr Farage been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Mrs May to reconcile its very divided positions was highlighted by Tories who were not in favour of Brexit who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep her Chequers' compromise plan on the right track among the attacks by Brexiters, the anti-Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that notwithstanding the negative reaction it is going to keep moving forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour party to choose between its package and the "kaos".
Mr Bone told the rally Leave Means Leave in Solihul that he wanted "to set aside Chequers' plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given a high social position and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, so far we would have issued," he said.
The MP Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit but we need to set aside Chequers' plan."
When he declared that it is against the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed his mind and must remain true."
Andrea Jenkyns, Brexitier of Tory, was also present for the demonstration, saying to the journalists: "I want to say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The plan of Chequers is not popular with the general public, the Opposition is not going to vote for it, not popular with our party and with our activists who are actually those who go on the streets and who will first vote for us.
Please forget Chequers' plan and start listening."
In a message aimed at Ms May, she said: "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that the politicians should "be feeling under pressure" if they were going to go back from the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to go back from Brexit and we are here today to tell them that "we will not leave you smooth if you do it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point that goes back from Brexit.
We are mobilising in Brexit the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and are not going to spend until we have become an independent, self-governmental and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those against Brixit walked in Birmingham before making a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the launch of this weekend group, a small number of activists called banners in writing Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit).
Lord Adonis who has a high social position in the Labour party has cut down on the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with party apps as soon as the conference opened.
"These are people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems in place and technology for Canada and more, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a full flara.
The idea of Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren intends to "examine us carefully" the possibility to come out for the presidential election
The United States The Senator Elizabeth Warren says that following the November elections we will "examine carefully the possibility of going out for the presidential election".
Boston Gobe reports that on Saturday the member of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke about her future in a debate with citizens at municipal level in the West Massachusetts.
Warren, who is a frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, will stand for a re-election in November against State Representative GOP Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the centre of speculation that might replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the constituents who have been using the format of a debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person who attended the meeting asked her if she intended to stand for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it is time "to women go to Washington to repair our fragmented government, and this includes a woman at the top."

The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. press conference ET.
On Friday they released a shooting video, asking for help to identify the man who appears in the video.
Sims, who was 20 years old, was killed by a fly near the campus of the University of Southern Friday morning.
According to 247sports, on Saturday the head of the police Murphy J. Paul told the media "Wayde Sims suffered from an injury caused by a run in his head and eventually died as a result."
Wayde came to defend his partner and was hit by a fly by Simpson.

Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears the world title after his team orders gave him the victory against Sebastian Vettel
Saturday, from the moment when Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that the orders of Mercedes' team would play an important part in the race.
From the position on the inside in the first row, Bottas had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as it defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel was the first to enter the stopping areas and let Hamilton leave others in the last place of the group, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in the break-up zone after another turn and came out right behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued following a few bicycle action with a bike that led the Ferrari driver to leave with difficulty on the inside free because of the risk of quitting after a double motion to defend in the third corner.
Max Versstopten started from the grid's rear row and was in seventh place until the end of the first turn in his 21st birthday.
It was then in the lead for most of the race by not changing its tyres with the aim of quickly completing and jumping the Kimi Ra to 4th place.
He eventually entered the standstill zone on the 44th turn but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight turns while Rakonten entered fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri made his work very well throughout the entire weekend and was a gentlom of true saying let me by.
The team did very exceptional work to get first and second place," said Hamilton.
That Was a Really Wrong Physical Attitude
President Donald Trump brought down to the sings of Senator Dianne Feinstein in rally on Saturday in connection with her insistence that she did not reveal the letter from Christine Blasey Ford who was accusing the nominated person of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh with a sexual attack.
Speaking in a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly direct the witness given by Ford in front of the Senate of the Judicial Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "vilful and disgusting and not sincere."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that was going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and vile and disgusting and not sincere," he said.
"When you look at statements and disclosures of information and then say "no, I did not.
I have not done it."
Do You Recall?
Dianne Feinstein, revealed some information?
Remember her answer... revealed the document - "e, e, what is it?
No you see.
I haven't revealed anything."
Look, wait a minute.
We have discovered... No, not revealing us," he added, while imitating the Senator.
Feinstein you sent her a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was discovered earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the disclosure was coming from her office.
"I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not reveal her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
"I asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But it seems that her rejection was not welcomed by the president, who during the rally of Saturday evening commented: "You know what we know, that that was a very bad physical attitude.
You may not have discovered, but that is the worst physical attitude you have ever seen."
While continuing his defence of the Supreme Court's nominated person, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that the democrats were using allegations for their purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by any necessary means.
You are seeing the vitality, disgustness, they do not care who hurts, whoever makes the sticks in the wheels to gain power and control," said the president according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer dark twice for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars set up for the loss of the Elite League of Week against Belfast Giants by winning the game against the same 5-3 adversary in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants gained an advantage of two gulls early in the game with two attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the same score to the team playing in his country before Dwyer regained an advantage for Giants.
Francois Bouuchard obtained the same score for Dundee before two golls of Lukas Lundvaldim Nielsen confirmed their victory.
This was the third win of the season at the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, which after several losses advanced to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth time that these two teams met, with Giants winning the three previous matches.
Dwyer's first camel took place in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a step by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford taking the step while Beauvilier doubled the advantage four minutes later.

Giants, who have now lost four out of their last five matches, will play in their country against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure that hundreds of People on the Airplane are able to escape from the Earth
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered to be a hero after he died to ensure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people succeeds in safe landing.
More than 800 people died and many were lost after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which triggered a tsunami.
Strong attacks continued to rule the area and many are trapped in a deed in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled to survive, the 21st year old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the swinging control tower at Palu Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
In this respect, the Commission notes that the airport services agreement concluded with Ryanair and AMS and the marketing services agreement signed with AMS and the marketing services agreement signed with Ryanair and AMS, as well as the marketing services agreement signed with AMS, did not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought that this was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
The speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yanhannes Sirait, said that the likely decision saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"When we hear about this we feel a great taste," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency says that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still located under the rubble while many could not be reached," said the speaker of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves of up to six metres destroyed Palu in which a dancing of mass will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance introduces bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia are working hard to help those who are still alive but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
The President of Indonesia Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military of the country: "I am asking you all to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Did he report the CNN?
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man is lost after the accident of the aircraft in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that led to the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that a man is lost, having previously stated that the 47 passengers and crew members had safely escaped from the aircraft he was stricken.
Air Niugini said in a statement that from Saturday afternoon, she could not give details about where one man's passenger was located.
The airline said that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to save passengers and other crew members after the aircraft hit the water when trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday the officials said that seven of the people were taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of which were in a stable condition.
What caused the incident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the US Naval Fleet both said that the aircraft land in the lagoon a little away from the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the aircraft exceeded the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the aircraft came very low.
"This is a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to pass through the water that was high to their waist until the emergency exit on the aircraft that was flooding.
He said that the flight assistants were pancating and shouting, and that he suffered from a small injury in his head.
The US Naval Fleet said that seafarers working nearby to improve a quay have also helped rescue by using an inflating boat to carry passengers to the shore before the aircraft slain in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Association Safety Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in PNG registered airline accidents but no incidents have involved Air Niugini.
Analist presents an evening time schedule in which a woman has burned a life
On Saturday the prosecution concluded her evidence on the case in the new process of a man who is accused that he burned a woman from Mississippi in 2014 while she was alive.
The Analist of the US Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as expert witnesses in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described for the jury how he used mobile records to gather information on the movements of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis defendant and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, in the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received localisation data from several mobile phones who showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening she died, who contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When mobile data showed that he was with Chambers at the time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city at that time.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was saying the truth when he said that night was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said that he was "receiving, since my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only one week.
Rowlett said that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his mobile phone.
"He deleted it from his life," said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to start its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expects the process to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop aware?
Three artists of the hip hop must challenge the negative perspective of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop has moved beyond its origins of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and again make the hip hop aware popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have seen a recent revival in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny by NY was summoned for having expelled her after a message "racist"
Nanny from New York is summoning a couple for discriminatory expulsion after receiving a message mistakenly from the mother who was complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racists, and compare the case with "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new person who played children, Giselle Maurice, was a dark carnage when he arrived at the first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEDEVEE OTHER SEWDA," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After being noticed by her deep mistake, Plasco-Flaxman felt "swift" and dismissed Mrs Maurice, saying that the former nanny, who was African-American, did not work well and that instead she was waiting for Philippians, according to New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for her one working day and was then sent to the house in Uber.
Now, Maurice is summoning the couple for compensation in relation to dismissal, and is asking for compensation of $350 per day for the live-in position of six months for which she had been initially employed, although without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, cannot do such things," she said to Post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked the statements that they are racist, saying that the dismissal of Ms Maurice was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust it after they offended it.
"Marter sent her something that she did not intend to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco to Post.
"But would you trust your children in someone who spoke to him goff, even if this was wrong?
Do your newborn?
And let us."
When comparing the case with an "extortion", Plasco said that only two months had passed since his wife had the baby and was "in a very difficult situation".
"Will you accuse someone so?
It's not good to do," added the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly announced the couple on social media, inducing them for their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not relate to a bear they spoke
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time before it was published.
"It is very fun that we now know what we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book from a small games bear, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book publication was "punishable but a bit saddened" after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a member of our family very important," added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he was never talking about him.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't filled with it itself," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real for him, it was like when you have a child to get something: be proud for them even if it is not you to have acquired something.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he was always giving merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to give her the last greeting on the phone
As soon as her daughter landed her was taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked to save her life but was in vain.
"Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to live," said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to give it the last greeting.
And that is what I did.
I told her, "Tahhi, I love you very much, my dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicines prescribed by doctors to keep her heart beating down and leave her system slowly.
She had died a little of the time before and started rolling everything.
What I could do is to sit down and wait, knowing that all of this is happening.
I couldn't call or wore or weep as I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold back really."
Eventually Ms Ednan-Laperouse, who was so far crying for her daughter's loss, went up on the aircraft together with the other passengers – who did not know about the difficult situation she was experiencing.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I had her head lowered, and the tear began to fall all the time.
I was hard to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy to Nad.
That he needed my love and that we were sanctuated.
I knew how much he loved her."
Place cards of women grieving to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one because of suicide are working to prevent others from removing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were sticking cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiration messages and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Ms Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew for his smile.
They were always saying that his smile was glowing every room."
However, he had to stop work before he died, because he was located "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I am always afraid that this will be the cause of another ugly event."
Ms Davis created cards, "to inform people that there are people who can open or meet with them, even if as a friend.
Do not put in silence – there is a need to speak."
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend for years with Ms Davies, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
"He was not saying that he is feeling faint or depressed or so," she said.
"Few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day it was very bad - when the children opened their gifts did not make any contact with them with their eyes or something so."
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but they must fight it: "I leave empty in the family.
It separates us.
But all of us must continue with our lives and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in a precarious situation as FBI starts an investigation
"I said, if we were to get something like what he asked - a limited investigation in time, limited in scope - perhaps we would bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "dealing" among partisan paralysis that was rooted.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reilency is fully due to the timing of the selection.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November - if, as expected, the Republicans do not do well, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to put the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was taking the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where they currently occupy a position 51 Republican and 49 Demokrat.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which allows Mike Pence, the vice-president, to vote and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea "cut" under Kim
The number of North Korea's desertors for South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, said South Korea's legislator.
Quoting a date from the ministry for the unification of the South Sea, Park Byeong-seug, said last year there were 1,127 party changes – compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates that human smugglers were requesting were key factors.
Pyonggyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of the deserters from the North Sea are exceptionally offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Many of them escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to share compared to the highly protected Demilitarized Area (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers the deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their home country forcefully.
The relations between the North and the South - technically still in war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Gyonggyang for talks that were focused on the stagnating of the denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the Korean peninsula free of nuclear danger.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, we will in no way be the first to unilaterally remove weapons," said Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," while he says he is unable to work in the Supreme Court
The Minority Leaders of the House Nancy Pelosi called Mr Brett Kavanaugh "steric" to the nominated person for the Supreme Court and said that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because of his temporary conduct.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't think of the fact that if a woman had ever behaved in that way, they would say "hysteric," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness before the Judicial Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were still young.
During his statement of opening, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he was even roaring and begging when he was talking about his family and the years of his secondary school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "assassination of the groteska and coordinated character" organized by the bitters that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he has prejudices against the democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself in those statements and the way in which he went after the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi welcomed when it was asked if she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say something--if he is not telling the truth to the Congress or the FBI, so he is not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but even to be in the court in which he is currently in," said Pelosi.
Currently Kavanaugh is a judge at the Court of Appeal of D.C.
Pelosi added that as Demokrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, being considered conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not fitting that a person with hysterical prejudices goes to court and expect to say, "very good," said Pelosi.
And Women need to exercise their Authority.
He is a fair verbal attack, months and years filled with anger, and she cannot say what she should say without weeping.
"We we we cry when we become angry," said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is a rare thing, what to say?"
She added, "It helped me a lot of a woman who was caught up in another place, who said that she even weeped when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and began to cry, she would tell the person who was talking to her, "It is probably thinking that it is sad because I are weeping.
I'm angry."
And then she did not stop.
And I thought that this was something brilliant."
The crying is allowed as a way to release one's great anger partly because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most clear memories of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, where once I found myself weeping with indiscretible anger, was when an older woman took me from my neck coat – a cold manager who always feared some of it – and carried me to the stairway.
"Never let them see you weep," she said.
"They don't know that you're angry.
They think you are sad and feel happy that they have managed to hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was at the time a member of the Democratic congress by Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was going out for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in a relationship outside the marriage on a boat known as Monkey Business and came out of the election, Ms Schroeder, very much angry, concluded that there was no reason why she did not explore the idea of issuing herself for the presidential election.
"This wasn't a well thought-out decision," she told me with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who were going out for the election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seventh Nani."
As this was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in raising funds, so she swore that she would not go out for election if she did not do $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who were giving $1,000 to her men were giving it only $250.
"They think I'm taking some discount?" she said.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so emotional - grateful to the people who supported her, angry with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and to target voters rather than delegates, and angry towards sexism - that I was hugged.
"I probably thought I should brake these powerful," reminded Mrs. Schroeder about the way the media reacted to it.
"I thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will you write on my grave?
"She cried?""
How the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The numbers of air bombs of the opening of the trade war between the United States and China used to destroy you, and while the battle still remains to end, a lack of agreement between the countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, say the experts.
Donald Trump, US President, gave the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing compared each time in the same way, while more recently it was presenting tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to agree with the US every time, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will give up in the near future.
The fact that Washington takes a step back means that it accepts the requests, but publicly the fact that China surrenders the US will be too embarrassing for some Jinping, the China president.
However, experts say that if Beijing works wisely, US trade war pressures can support China positively in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a political decision quickly in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for starting economic chaos in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what the spectators previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, research partners focusing on Asia at the New American Security Centre (Center for New American Security), which is a reflection group.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war lasting more than seven years.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the war started in 2011 more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
A further 6 million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the edition.
Europe embraces Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Gulf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in a European land and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team reached the 14.5 points it needed to win the United States.
Phil Mickelson who is preminent in the United States, who struggled throughout the tornament, gave his coup in the water at the 16th pair-3 hole, thus giving up his game to Francesco Molari.
The Italian golfer Molari spiced in all his rounds, and became 1 out of 4 players who have ever brought 5-0-0-0 since the start of the current tornament format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against the lowest-level player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player of the highest level of the world, Dustin Johnson, brought 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who played in his final Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best ever European tornament player with 25.5 points throughout his career.
"I couldn't weep but today I couldn't keep it.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful for Thomas who chose me and who believed in me.
I am very happy, very pleased to get back the cup.
The team is everything, and I am happy that I could help," said Garcia immobilized after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot partner John Ram who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles play Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel, that I won Tiger Woods, when I grew up to follow him," said 23 year old Rahm.
Woods lost all of his four matches in France and now has a record of Ryder Cup 13-21-3 throughout his career.
A strange statistics of one of the best players ever here, who won 14 main titles, second after Jack Nicklaus only.
Team USA struggled to find those parts of the golf racecourse with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high calibre golf throughout the tornament.
The US captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I am proud of these men, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We were argument.
Thomas is visited by the chapel.
It's a very good captain.
His 12 player played very well.
We will rejoin, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 young men and I am proud that I am a master.
You have to catch the hat and tilt your head.
Have played it better."
