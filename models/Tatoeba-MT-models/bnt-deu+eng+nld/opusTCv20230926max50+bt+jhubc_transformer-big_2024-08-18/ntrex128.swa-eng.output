Welsh Council delegates worry about 'looking like puppets'
There are concerns among some delegates after the proposal that their position should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to the plan to change the council's name to the Welsh Parliament.
Council delegates from all political parties are concerned that the move will cause sarcasm.
One Lebanese delegate said that his group was concerned that the name "is equivalent to Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means fool and pwp means feces.
Plaid's envoy said that the group as a whole is "uninterested" and has proposed an alternative name.
The Conservative envoy said his group was "thinking in ideas" about the name change, but said they were the words of the MWP abbreviation to Karagosi.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced the same as the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Council panel, which is currently enacting legislation to introduce nominal change, said: "The final decision on any keyword as to how the Council's delegates are actually referred to will actually belong to the delegates themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh council the authority to change its name.
In June, Jopo published the results of negotiations with the public on proposals that were broadly supported in reference to the council as the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the position of Council Delegate, Joppo preferred the Welsh Parliament or WMP delegates, but the MWP option received more support in consultations with the public.
As seen, the Council Delegate proposes an alternative option, but efforts to reach an agreement may be a challenge for the Superintendent, Elin Jones, eitherbye is expected to submit a legislative draft on changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on change will include other changes to how the council works, including rules to remove the Board Commissioner's merits and the structure of the committee's system.
Council delegates will vote on the last name they will be called when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the country's name to "North Macedonia."
This popular vote was organized to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Authorities in Athens maintain that the name of neighbouring countries in the north represents a claim to their territory and have continued to oppose its request for membership in the European Union and the NATO Union.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of a direct referendum on changing the name, has said he will ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that a change of name is needed so that they can join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin Goes Silence as Churches in Harlem Through Chagamoto
"Historically, the elders with whom I have rolled say that there was a church and a bar at every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there's none."
He said the absence of a bar is understandable.
"People stagger in different ways" these days, he said.
"The bars are hesitant to be like a neighborhood lounge where people meet from time to time."
On the part of the churches, he is concerned that the money available from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders also expect, "and will soon return to their initial state."
Churches, he added, may be converted into large apartments with privately owned houses that will not help maintain the remaining storage in the surrounding area.
"The large number of people who are buying private houses in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus this situation will speed up these churches to be closed in general because there is no possibility that people in these apartments will be allies of these churches."
Both churches were built by white collaborators before Harlem became a city for blacks - the City Community in 1870 and became known as St. Martin a decade later.
The traditional Methodist allies that were white left in the 1930s.
Members who were blacks participating in the surrounding area took over the constructions.
St. Martin came under black allies under vicar John Howard Johnson, who led a strike by retailers at 125th Street, the main street for purchase in Harlem, who refused to hire or associate with blacks.
The fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but when allies in the vicar Johnson church laid out plans to rebuild it, they authorized the establishment of a set of bells played using a keyboard or a mechanical technique.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Priest Johnson and St. Martin's heir, called the set of bells "the bells of the poor."
An expert who played a set of bells in July called it another name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreversible historical marker."
Expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also recognized that it was the world's first set of bells that were played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved into the area of the largest set at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not seek another replacement.
The bells that have been played in St. Martin over the past several months have been played by architects and contractors in a complex manner, some of whom were brought by church leaders, and some by the bishopric.
The administrative body in the parish, comprising the ecclesiastical hierarchy â€“ wrote to the diocese in July concerned that the diocese "had a plan to transfer costs" to the council, even though the council had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors who were sent by the diocese.
Some associates complained about the absence of clarity from the diocese.
Pope injures a 13-year-old child while diving to trap rope-tree in California
The Pope attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving to trap a lobster-tree in Carlifonia on the first day of the lobster-tree season, officials said.
The invasion occurred shortly before 1 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a young man screaming for help and then rowed with a group to help him get overboard.
Hammel said that the first time he thought of it was just the excitement of investing a rope-tree, but "I noticed that he was screaming, 'I'm bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His shoulder bone had come out," Hammel said he discovered it after reaching a boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
Boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed as in critical condition.
The species of shark that made an invasion is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said in a press session that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was classified as not a species of dangerous sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries in the upper part of his doubleheader.
Officials closed the shoreline from Pontus Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles suggested that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury wants to fight Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams using a range of beauty pageants with staff who are auxiliary professionals.
As a major part of planning to enter the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow as fashion sales and home furnishings decline, large beauty rows will be tested in 11 stores across the country and set up in more stores next year if this step is to be successful.
Investing in beauty has come to them as supermarkets sought to fill the shelves spaces that were used to install television, microwave and household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the offer of beauty products to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing editions starting in L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more spaces with branded locations similar to those in stores such as Boots.
This supermarket is also re-opening a shop for a variety of cosmetic products so that most of the products train people who don't eat meat - which is very pressured by young buyers.
Moreover, the Perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will experiment at two Sainsbury's, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the purchasing privileges of daily food products on a small scale in a nearby retail store means supermarkets have to make more effort to lure people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive at Sainsbury, has said that the store will have more appearances as a unit store with a chain of supermarkets trying to deal with Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has been introducing Argos subsidiaries in hundreds of stores and has also established some Habitats stores from the time it bought the two grocery chain two years ago, which states that it has increased grocery sales and made the service to find customers more beneficial.
The department store's initial attempt to revive its beauty units and medicines came to nothing.
Sainsbury experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger was discontinued after a dispute arose over how to distribute revenues from pharmacies located in its supermarkets.
A new approach was introduced after Sainsbury sold his 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds is said to contribute to the deal, by adding more luxury brand products for face care and skin including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's business director, said: "We have adapted the look and nature of our range of beauty products to improve the environment of our customers.
We have also invested in professional staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our various editions have been designed to meet all the needs and environments that are attractive and appropriate means that we have now become an exciting place for beauty products that offers a great deal of competition for the original ways to make a purchase."
Peter Jones 'disgusted' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was left 'angered' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million signing deal and her lifestyle brand business to focus more on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have enough time for their Truety brand of household products and spares.
The business of the two was connected to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The broadcaster of This Morning, 37, wrote on Instagram announcing he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons star" Den Peter Jones frustrated by withdrawing from their elegant live-action fashion branding at the last minute - to focus on her new superhero contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "disgusted" when the celebrity girl in television admitted at a very worried meeting on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business plans - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant that she would not have enough time to handle their branding of Truly's home appliances and spares.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow and had been said to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, wrote on Instagram to announce that he was leaving the business of Truely, Jones left England by plane for one of his vacation homes.
The source said: "Truly was among the things Holly focused on most.
It was to be his permanent future that would allow him to continue over the next several decades.
His decision to withdraw was a surprise to everyone involved.
No one believed what was going on on Tuesday, the launch time had come very close.
There are full warehouses at Marlow Headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this broadcaster of This Morning, who is all of you more likely to be relied on in the United Kingdom, can cost the business millions of dollars due to large investments in products including rivers, candles, clothes and household appliances and the possibility of launching delays.
And it can signal the end of long-term friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and become Dan Baldwin has been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truely with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple goes on vacation with Jones who owns 40<0x25> in Baldwin's Running Factory.
Willoughby is expected to be an ambassador for the M<0x26>S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A news source near Jones said last night that "We couldn't comment on his controversial activities."
Conversation with a strong 'and then we loved each other'
He joked about the criticisms he would get from news organizations for commenting that others would consider to be "inadequate to the president" and in praise of the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so desperate?
Trump said in his sarcastic tone "a publicist".
"I haven't given up on anything."
He suggested that Kim prefers a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June to be hailed by Trump as a major step towards disarmament of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But nuclear disarmament talks are stuck.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, the famous North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the U.N. The United Nations General Assembly Saturday that the North Korean nation has not seen a "equal move" from the United States for the early stages of disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, the Reforms have promoted sanctions that are aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump had a promising attitude in his speech to the rally.
"We're going on well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
We have now established a good partnership."
He said his efforts to improve cooperation with Kim have resulted in good results â€“ halting rocket tests, assisting in the release of hostages and assisting in the repatriation of the corpses of American troops.
And he defended his unusual way of discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded stadium, we'd have 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing a finger at the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake Indonesia Brings Big Damage to the Island, Killing Hundreds of People
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told to be unnecessary.
Even though more than 10<0x25> of Lombok's population had been evacuated, no national disaster was declared, a condition needed to encourage international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they don't ask for international assistance, which is challenging". Ms. Sumbung said.
With Save the Children locking the team together to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign workers can work remotely.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see the cancellation of international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Due to the frequent land vibrations that occur in Indonesia, the country hio has been left in poor alignment due to natural disasters.
Although residential shelters due to the effects of the tsunami have been built in Aceh, they are not very common in coastal areas.
The actual lack of tsunami warning bells in Palu, even though the warning existed, may have contributed to the disaster.
At its best, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural dysfunctions make shipping operations confusing.
A hospital ship that had been set up in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is headed for Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the disaster area.
President Joko Widodo used the degraded infrastructure in Indonesia as the core of your electrification campaigns, and has invested heavily in the construction of roads and railways.
But the financial deficit has been a challenge for Mr. Joko's government as he approaches the election next year.
Mr. Joko is also dealing with pressure from sector groups, where many Muslim allies have had a conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and dozens of evictions when Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, by strangling swords, bows and arrows and other fierce weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a strong equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League match against Chelsea by tying in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri with about 30 yards from Chelsea's gate with his team behind by a score of 1â€“0.
He moved the ball with the left foot before lifting the interception to the top edge of the gate.
The ball mounted over the defensive zone and headed towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball then passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who had jumped and ended up in the net.
"It was just trying to be in a hio position, to reach the ball and players like Shaq always play the ball towards the front as they can, so I tried to fend for myself as long as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I took one touch and I didn't even think so much about it and I just hit the shorts."
Chelsea led 1â€“0 during the break after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The attacker for The Blues team struck with a heel pass and returned it for Mateo Kovacic in the game, before turning around in the middle of the field and running in the side of Liverpool's gate.
Kovacic awarded the pawn to another player and surrounded the opponent and received it in the middle of the field.
He then scored a fumble that allowed Hazard to head into the box.
Hazard accelerated the defenders and scored the scoreboard on the opposite side of the gate with a shot of the left foot against Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool meet Napoli in group matches of the Champions League at 9pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meet Videoton in the Europa League at 9pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said earlier on Sunday.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday causing waves up to 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has over 380,000 people, was filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man, aged 32, for alleged murder after a woman stabbed and died
An investigation into the murder has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside on the eve of today.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 1.55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested for alleged murder.
Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard nothing to show up.
Investigation superintendent Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages but I would appeal to anyone who was close to John Street in Birkenhead and see or hear anything he doubted to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have intercepted anything with their car cameras to contact us because they may have explanations that are important to the investigation.'
A police spokesman has confirmed that a woman whose body was found to be a resident of Birkenhead and was inside the building.
This day friends who believe they know a woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway and police have said that they are in the process of notifying the family members of the plaintiff.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has now tried to enter his house but is told by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He had no say when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told that it can take several hours before being allowed into the building.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the whole area is now being considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up in the area crying.
He goes on to repeat the words 'very annoying'.
At 8 p.m. police cars were in the building and another car was outside.
Several officers stood inside the apartment and tracked the flat fleas.
Anyone with information is asked to send a personal message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers team without identifying himself on 0800 555 111 and referencing the 247th of September 30th.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the latest memorial to face the crisis of 'rewriting history'
His removal will be a worthy justice for his Taliban-like destruction to the art of many of the religious and willful British acts carried out by his radical Puritan allies.
But Cromwell's Community described Mr. Crick's proposal to be "sweet" and "will respond to rewriting history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell's Community, said: "It would have been inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's model outside Westminster Castle would be targeted.
The act of destroying symbols in the civil war in England was neither enlightened nor enforced by Cromwell.
Perhaps the worst that Cromwell would have been blamed for was the actions of his grandfather Thomas in the last century.
The fascinating representation of Mr. William Hamo Thorneycroft to Cromwell is evidence of 19th century views and part of the history of the man who many believe is still worthy of being celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is respected by many, perhaps more in the 19th century than now, as an advocate of parliament from outside pressure, a situation for which he was the source of royal leadership.
Whether this is all a correct representation in the topic of an ongoing historical debate.
What is evident is that the wars of the mid-17th century have laid the foundation for the future development of our country and Cromwell is a self-identified individual who is recognized to represent a single wing in those rival groups.
His success as Lord Protector is also worthy of being celebrated and observed."
Pig Killer Amng'ata and Killing Chinese Farmer
A farmer was raided and killed by pigs in a market in southwestern China, according to media reports in the region.
The man, identified by the last name of "Yuan," was found dead with a badly affected vein lying blood near a pig shed in a market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate them in a pig room on May 20, 2005 in <0x58>ining province of <0x51>inghai, China.
He is said to have traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered the door of a neighboring pig shed was open.
He said that at the pig stand there was a male pig with blood in his mouth.
An investigation confirmed that the <0xC2><0xA3>550 pound pig had smuggled and killed the farmer, according to reports.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and broken," a cousin, referred to by his first name as "Wu," said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Videos from security cameras showed Yuan arriving in the market at 10.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither owned by Yuan nor his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been tied away to prevent him from attacking someone else, while police collected evidence in the area.
Yuan's family and market mercenaries are reported to be discussing the ransoming of his death.
Although rarely occurring, cases of swine invasive humans have been previously recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing <0xC2><0xA3>650 pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the mistress shocked him and fled.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but tasting blood could be "a catalyst."
"They're just playing.
They are sniffing, and curious ... they have no intention of injuring you.
You just have to respect them properly," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa bringing heavy rain across the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa continues to weaken as it passes over more static waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, typhoon Rosa will bring torrential rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa was a gust of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane at 11 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and was sighted 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
At this time, atmospheric pressure has begun to accumulate over the Pacific Ocean and head eastward toward the West Coast of the United States, while Hurricane Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to push tropical humidity northward into the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday
Then, the tropical humidity that begins to interact with the approaching atmospheric pressure will cause more rainfall in the Southwest in the future.
Inland areas, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will cause sudden dangerous flooding, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause levels of rainfall up to 2 to 3 inches per hour at one point, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation rates are expected to be 2 to 4 inches of rainfall in southwestern parts, especially most areas of Arizona.
Sudden flooding can occur due to conditions that continue to deteriorate due to conditions of tropical rainfall.
It will be very dangerous to go out in the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rains.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to become large rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and scattered dust.
The impending atmospheric monsoon will bring heavy rainfall in some of the coastal areas of Southern California.
Total levels of precipitation over half an inch may occur, which may result in a small mudflat and slippery roads.
This will be the first precipitation in the area in the rainy season.
Some of the rising showers of tropical rainfall will begin heading into Arizona areas later on Sunday and Monday rescheduling, before more rainfall later on Monday and Tuesday.
Most of the rainfall will cover the Four Horn on Tuesday through Wednesday.
The month of October may have a high temperature change throughout the United States with a decrease in the Aquatic temperature, but areas in the tropics will continue to have moderate temperatures.
Sometimes this phenomenon causes sudden temperature changes over short distances.
There is a good example of a sudden variation in temperatures throughout the central United States on Sunday.
There is approximately a temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the heat of the approaching summer will try to accumulate and spread again.
Most areas of the central and eastern United States are expected to warm up in early October and extend 80 degrees from the Southern Plains to the Northwest.
Temperatures in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term meteorological forecasts show a greater likelihood of temperatures exceeding average in the eastern United States through half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh case
More than 20 million people watched overwhelming evidence on Thursday by Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh and a woman who accuses him of sexual abuse that is said to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, in six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular sessions to illuminate the final stage of Friday's events: an agreement enforced by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is 100<0x25> confident that Kavanaugh held her secret places while drunk and tried to strip her at a high school ceremony.
Kavanaugh, giving emotional testimony, said that he is 100<0x25> sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that over 20.4 million people as reported by Nielsen on Friday watched.
The company used to count average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC stations.
Data was not available immediately from other networks that aired, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And the Nielsen organization usually has the challenge of counting people who are watching in office.
To put this in the right perspective, hio is an audience sized by the audience of a filtered football game or Academy Awards.
The Fox News Center, whose commentators are strongly integrated in Kavanaugh's selection, led all networks to average 5.69 million viewers during a day-to-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Ham remained on top after the trial.
Flake was the main topic in the Friday hiatus case.
After this moderate Republican officer reported that he would be supporting Kavanaugh's nomination, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning getting hooked up with the plaintiffs as he tried to climb the elevator to attend the Court Committee hearing.
He stood down for several minutes while being reprimanded, an event that was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
She was told, "you're strong when most women aren't strong."
Flake said that his office had released a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have much to say in the committee's case.
The broadcasting and cable networks were all flashing directly hours later, while the Court Board was voting to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a full vote.
But Flake said he could do it consciously that the FBI could investigate allegations against an electorate in the coming week, which the few Democrats have been arguing.
Flake was to some extent convinced by a conversation with his friend, the Democrat Senator. Chris Coons.
After discussions with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was strong, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without scrutiny.
President Trump has opened an investigation through the FBI into allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May has accused opponents of 'playing politics' in connection with Brexit.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May denounced opponents of her plan to withdraw from the European Union for "playing politics" with Britain's future and bullying national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview near his on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson insisted on his attacks on his plan known as Chequers for Brexit, saying the suggestion that the UK and the EU should collect everyone's tributes is "absolute nonsense."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for the second degree of murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered glasses from the attack site and said they found Simpson's DNA in the glasses, the WAFB, a CBS associate, said.
After interviewing Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail is set at <0xC2><0xA3>350,000, the Attorney reported.
East Baton Rouge's obituary office released an earlier report on Friday, saying the cause of death is a bullet wound to the head in the neck.
The department congratulates a Louisiana State Police commissioner, police crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the suspect's arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authority for "equity and justice enforcement."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-tall player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played for LSU's basketball team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in hitting the ball in the game the previous season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply affected" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
"Things like this are the ones that make someone nervous all the time," said Wade.
Volcano launches ash over Mexico City
The ash that is launched from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighboring areas of southern Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from volcanoes after activity intensified within the crater and recorded 183 times of emissions and ash over 24 hours.
This station was tracking many roars and vibrations.
Social media photographs showed thin ash covering car mirrors in neighboring Mexico City areas such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geologists have discovered an increase in activity on the volcano which is located 45 kilometers (720 miles) south-east of the capital since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake occurred in central Mexico in September 2017.
A volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash Catalan separatist sympathies ahead of celebration of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with the protest police while thousands joined the opposition protests to mark the first year of the Katalunya separatist vote.
A group of puppet demonstrators who supported separatism barred from the police beat them with eggs and threw powder paint at them, resulting in dark clouds of dust on the street that would normally be crowded with tourists.
Riots also occurred later that day as police used their staffs to confront clashes.
For over several hours the pro-independence groups were saying "No forgetting, no forgiveness" they were confronted by the united protestors who were saying, "Uhispiania always."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries found in protests, regional media reported.
Concerns have remained high in the area favouring independence a year after a referendum on 1 October considered illegal by authorities in Madrid but celebrated by the pro-Katalunya separatists.
Voters largely chose to gain independence, though the number of people who showed up as low as anti-party candidates ignored the vote by a large margin.
According to the Katalunya authorities around 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop polling in polling stations throughout the region, causing severe violence.
Freedom supporters groups had camped throughout the night on Friday to block protests to help national police.
The protests continued but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a protest to secede from his wife said he was no longer optimistic of Katalunya's prospects for independence.
"Last year we got to live in the best period of life.
I watched my parents cry happily for being able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite securing an important victory in the last regional elections in December, pro-Katalian independence parties have failed to maintain momentum in this year with many of the best-known leaders in exile on their own terms or in detention awaiting trial for organizing a referendum and a future report on gaining independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car technician recording a protest supporting police on her phone, said the dispute had been caused by politicians from both sides.
"Concerns are getting more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Katalunya leaders in a pre-trial jail since late last year, announced that he would hold a seat for them in the European Parliament election next year.
"Standing as a candidate for elections to the European Parliament is the best way to reject the backdrop of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a house hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car hit a series of homes in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the gates and the building itself.
The bow bow may also have been fired by a car at some point.
Menga Bay gives Livingston a 1â€“0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured the victory
Livingston's promotion surprised Rangers with Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as the club's manager of Ibrox.
The Dolly Menga split results between both teams as Gary Holt's team moved on to retain the same second position as Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated in tournament matches in the Premier League this season and will face the leaders Hearts, who are ahead of them by eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston have increased the number of unbeaten matches to six in the rankings, where head coach Holt has not yet been defeated since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chance against unscathed aliens
Holt's team was to be ahead long before closing, with their direct attacking game causing Rangers problems of all sorts.
Scott Robinson was able to get a chance but missed the goal with his fumble passed in front of the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only hit the ball out after infiltrating to intercept a header from Craig Halkett.
The locals did not appear to worry and allowed Rangers to own the game, knowing that they can trouble the aliens with the use of a cab shooter.
And that's the way where they were able to score a goal.
The Rangers were penalized for a punt and Livingston struggled to find a gap, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to give Menga a chance, who touched and tied the scoreboard from the centre of the box.
At the time, the Rangers had controlled possession of the ball but failed to penetrate the home team's defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly would not be challenged for a long period of play,
The format continued in the second period, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save his fumble.
Scott Pittman was barred by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow landed the ball out after another Livingston punt game.
Attacks continued to tighten Livingston's team's kit and continued to be cleared, while two penalties - after Halkett dropped reserve player Glenn Middleton, and another in regards to holding the ball by hand - were ignored.
'Awesome' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont at BBC Scotland Profile at Tony Macaroni
Wonderful work and good results for Livingston.
In reality, they had a better game and continue to exceed expectations and continue to climb to the table.
Their playing style with the team has not changed much since their return to the major leagues, but many praise goes to Holt in a way that he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett contributed substantially, well-suited the better-organized defensive stronghold, while Menga gave them routines to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the entire match.
The Rangers lacked motivation, however.
Just as they've been good sometimes under Gerrard, they were below those standards.
They missed the last touch at the gate - only once they were able to create a chance to get the bao in the home team's stronghold - and the hio is a challenge for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets a reception with a different feeling in Cologne
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
They have varied on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkish accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
The town is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons as a barrier for a crowd of 25,000 not to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The two-party protests point to a schism about the attitude of a president who appears as a hero to some German Turks and was hailed by others as a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after crashing into a car
A cyclist has died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Road and Evelyn Road, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics arrived but the man died while at the scene.
The accident comes several months after another cyclist died in an incident of being hit and escaped on Childers Road, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The City Police said officials were working to identify the man and notify his relative.
Road closures and bus directing have been imposed and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison : six officers are addressed in riots
Six prison officials have been injured in a riot in a high-security men's jail, the Jela Office has said.
The riot occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 9:30 BST on Sunday and continues.
Experts "Tornado" have been brought in to deal with the riot, which involves eight inmates and has been stabbed in one corner of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the Jela Service said: "Student-trained workers in prison have been brought in to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for minor injuries.
We don't support violence in our prisons and it's clear that those involved will be taken to the police and can be extended more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the jail governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year protest officials were called to prison in response to a major disruption in which workers were attacked with table balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Sudden Flooding (Sudden Summers May Benefit)
It is not uncommon for a tropical depression to occur in Arizona, but that is exactly what can happen early next week as the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Western Desert and cause a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flash flood warning Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday and close later Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has described on tweet that "10 tropical cyclones have maintained storms and low pressure conditions within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
Recent examples of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, as well as a few levels of up to 6 inches on Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Western Desert including the Great Basin Rockies are likely to get 1 to 2 inches and a few levels of up to 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of sudden flooding, hurricane Rosa's rainfall may be a blessing because the area is arid.
Although flooding is a major concern, some of these precipitation can be beneficial because the South West experiences arid conditions.
According to U.S. Drought Monitoring. just over 40<0x25> of Arizona is witnessing at least severe drought, the second highest type," Weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landfall through the territory of the Mexican Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, still typhoon-powered on Sunday morning with a peak intensity of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is heading north for 12 miles per hour.
The storm is subject to static water in the Pacific and is thus decreasing its strength.
Thus, it is expected to reach the ground in Mexico with tropical storm strength during the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be high, causing significant flooding risk.
"A 3 to 6 inch rainfall is expected from Baja California to Sonora in the northwest and likely up to 10 inches," Weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the morning on Tuesday as a tropical depression and then heading upward through Arizona and southern Utah Tuesday night.
"The main risk expected from typhoon Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and Northwest Sonora Desert and the United States.[citation needed] Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
Rain is expected to cause sudden life-threatening flooding and mudslides in deserts and landslides in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton attack: Arrest of four attempted murder
Three teenagers of a 20-year-old man have been arrested on charges of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found to have been stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found injured at the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, at the 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he has been admitted to a "solid" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, 18-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon Police and Somerset Police said.
Officials have asked anyone who may have intercepted and recorded an incident with a mobile phone to appear.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'showed, bored and angry' by Democrats
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote is a vote to reject the brutal and threatening tactics of the Democrat Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been "expressed by the outrage" of the Democrat Party during his entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally rejecting allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually abused him decades ago when they were young.
Ford also testified in a trial regarding the woman's claims.
The President said Saturday that "the American people felt Kavanaugh's cleverness and excellence and courage" that day.
"The vote to prove Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to prove one of the most brutally completed genius of our times, a lawyer with a good public service record," he told a crowd in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the need for Republican supporters to appear to vote in representative elections.
"Five weeks from now one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but from another perspective I'm really running for," he said.
"Well I mean I'm going around all over to beat up good candidates."
Trump said that the Democrats are willing to "oppose and prevent."
The first important systematic vote in the Senate regarding Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, the GOP leadership's senior assistant has told CNN.
Hundreds are killed in earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia and death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed, many were drowned as large waves reached the beaches, while a massive earthquake and tsunami shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a ceremony on the coast in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of six metres (18 ft) struck the land at night and blew up many and destroyed everything there was.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When the tsunami threat happened yesterday, people were still doing their operations on the coast and did not immediately flee and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesian disaster prevention agency BNPB said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone of it, it came about sliding cars, logs, houses, it affected everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled into the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before attacking the coast.
Other people climbed trees to avoid tsunamis and saved themselves," he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 stations in the city of Palau.
Space pictures released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, bridges were overturned and drowned by a water-covered mosque.
Minor tremors continued to be heard in the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was heard in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Assessments and Applications of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was nearly 200 times stronger compared to the atomic bomb that detonated Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a thin sheet may have caused a tsunami surge, it said.
Nugroho described the demolition situation as being "extreme" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels were destroyed.
. The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 others were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala , which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely disabled without any information" from Donggala , Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but it could be worse," it said.
The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for not informing that the tsunami had struck Palu , although leaders said waves arrived shortly after the warning was issued.
In a non-technical video shared on social media, a man in the upper floor of the building can be heard shouting about approaching tsunami warnings to people on the street.
Within minutes the tides reach the coast and carry buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately confirm this video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power loss in a wide area which interrupted communications near Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes and supplies from Jakarta and other towns, authorities said, but the evacuated still need food and other basic needs.
The town's airport has only been opened with relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit rescue centers in Palu on Sunday.
The Death toll from the Indonesian Tsunami rises to over 800.
The Situation Is Too Bad.
With World Vision workers from Donggala safely successful in the town of Palu, where workers are sheltering themselves in tent placed outside their office, they went through devastating incidents along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they saw many destroyed homes" he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even though aid groups began relief operations, some complained that foreign workers with deep expertise were being barred from travelling in Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, money, equipment and personnel from abroad can only begin to enter if the disaster declares to be national.
That's not done yet.
"It's still a regional level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government has said, "OK, this is a national disaster," we can open up for international support but there is still no such situation."
When the second night engulfed the city of Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing were hopeful that their loved ones would play and make you a miracle in their hopeless stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was found from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been lying under the rubble for two days and her mother's body near her.
Gendon Subandono , coach of the Indonesia national umbrella team, had coached two of the umbrella jumpers who have lost for the Asian Games, which was completed this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, along with Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a leader in the field of umbrella jumping, I have my emotional load," he said.
Mr. Gendon described how, hours after information about the Roa Roa Hotel spread between the community of participants in the umbrella jump, he had sent WhatsApp a message to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed one grey mark, instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the message was not read," he said.
Thieves take <0x24>26,750 while filling ATM at Levee's Newport
Thieves on Friday morning stole <0xC2><0xA3>26,750 from a Brink employee while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a story from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver was withdrawing money from the ATM in the entertainment hall and preparing to put more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was dealing, another man "run from the back of Brink's staff" and stole a bag of money that was meant to be shipped.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, according to reports, but police did not describe the specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Bullying artist changes his name to Ye
Kanye West's rapper changes his name to -Ye.
Advertising a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A creature officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been temporarily nicknamed Ye and used the name as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
This change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
She takes the role of singer Ariana Grande on the show who was appalled for "emotional reasons ," the show's producer said.
Despite being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'he' is a word commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, referring to the name of his album with radio producer Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, it is us.
It changed from Kanye, which means the only one, and just being Ye - to be the embodiment of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more an example of what we are."
He's one of the famous thugs who changed their names
Sean Combs used to be known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his privileges under the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West member, JAY-Z, has also had to use his name with or without a lowercase spelling.
ACLO of Mexico promises not to use force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians as the country is about to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza that he "did not use the military to deal with the Mexican people."
Militants shot at peaceful demonstrations in the building on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people while left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin American countries.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support the youth of Mexico by offering monthly tuition to students and opening unpaid public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join organized crime.
The United States should double the funding of the A.I.
As China continues to be more involved in smart intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money it spends on research in the hio fields, said AI investor and expert, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Opinion comes after various U.S. government units make announcements about AI, even though the US generally lacks the official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: and intends to be number 1 in the AI's discovery by 2030.
"To double the AI budget will be a good start, due to the situation that all the other countries are far behind the US and we are looking for new innovations at the AI," Lee said.
Increasing double funds may double the chance that the next major AI success will be held in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most influential AI companies in China, Face <0x2B><0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he developed an AI system that won the top U.S. Othello player and later became active in Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee agreed that the US government's previous technology competition as of the Robotics Corporation in the Deep Defense Research Programs and asked to know when the next race would take place, to help identify future professionals.
Researchers in the United States often have to do extra work to get federal aid, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes professional leaders, it's companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired stars from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the AI.
"I think green cards should be issued directly to PhD students at AI," he said.
The Chinese Land Committee released its Development Plan in Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Dedication of Natural Sciences of China provides money to people in educational institutions similar to how the Dedication of Natural Sciences and other government agencies donate money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Center for Collaboration in Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage collaborators from the sector and scholars and the White House announced the creation of a Committee of Investigations in Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in a plan called AI Next.
For the NSF, it currently provides over <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law that sought to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken effect for months now.
Macedonian referendum on change of country name
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday on the change of its name to the "North Macedonia Republic," a move that could resolve a multi-year dispute with Greece that prevents its application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has maintained that the name of a neighbouring country in the north represents a claim to its province and has rejected the country's request for membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June according to the proposed new name, but national opponents say the change will sustain the ethnic recognition of the majority of the Calvinist population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in a referendum and a ignoring campaign has caused doubts about whether the voter turnout would reach the 50<0x25> threshold necessary for a referendum to be correct.
The question in the referendum reads: "Do you support NATO's membership with the EU and accept an agreement with Greece."
Followers of nominal changes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a bailout suitable for compensation to be accepted into organizations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries formed from the disintegration of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonian people so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU because the move hio means a safe life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally recognized, enough members of parliament have said they will support the results of the vote to make it more serious.
Nominal changes would require the support of two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The country's election commission has said that there have been no reports of any violations by seven o'clock in the afternoon.
However, the voter turnout was only 16<0x25>, compared to 34<0x25> in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016 while 66<0x25> of registered voters voted.
""I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski , 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country a move that would open a way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of Skopje's parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small platform and organizing seats in front of tents designed by those who would oppose the referendum.
"We join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join willingly, not through the back door by pressure" said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our honor.
If they don't want to register us as Macedonia, we can join others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia partnership."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO's membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of 20<0x25>.
"I believe a large number will support because 80<0x25> of our citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said that the result of "yes" would be "proof of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said between 30<0x25> and 43<0x25> of voters will participate in a referendum - below the required level .
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma television , found that 57<0x25> of participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70<0x25> said they would vote yes.
In order for a referendum to correct the number of voters should be 50<0x25> and one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will represent the first major blow to the government's lean government policy since it took over in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City surrounds all of Brighton's castle and closes the bars
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling humiliated Brighton's porn guards in a match that Manchester City won 2â€“0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look very easy when he scored on the scoreboard in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker got a pass in the middle of the field and started the series.
He passed between three of Brighton's banks, before penetrating an open area.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players.
He pushed one bunker and then fastest the other at the corner of Brighton's gate box.
He then ironed at his left side, and found Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the box and returned the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot around Brighton's gatekeeper Mathew Ryan and a fumble into the right side of the net.
"Aguero faces some problems in his legs," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have tied the bao in at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first control in a Premier League match.
The scoreboard was tied at the 29th minute.
Aguero received a ball inside the Brighton area in the attack.
He scored a good pass through the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched a few times before giving Sterling a pass on the other side of the gate.
The Sky Blues attacker touched the ball into the net before it began celebrating.
City clashes with Hoffenheim in a group stage match of the Champions League at 12:55pm Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a destroyer against. Rockies
With the Nationals already cleared from the playoffs, he had no other grounds for forcing another start.
But a highly competitive Scherzer claims to be a block on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still serious damage in the playoffs to the Rockies, who are proud of having one game not played against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies won the qualifying match by winning 5â€“2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking for the first crown in the rankings.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can play a tough game in terms of the situation it will be here in Denver and the crowd and the team hio the rest will be playing at the highest level in every level I'm going to face this year .
Why wouldn't I want to compete at that level?"
The Nationals have not yet announced players to begin the game on Sunday, but say they have liked to allow Scherzer to throw the ball into the situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting his 34th game, practiced hurling on Thursday and will be throwing on his rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-handed player has an 18â€“7 average of 2.53 runs and 300 points deflected by hits in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation facing his appointee Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court when he discussed the need for Republicans to appear in a plurality in the election of representatives.
"All the results we found are at stake in November.
Five weeks from the most important choices in our lives.
This one is one of the big, big choices -- I'm not running but in another view I'm really running for and that's why I'm all around to beat the debe good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this awful, terrible group of Democrats, you see what they are doing right now.
And they've decided to take power by whatever means possible, you can see loneliness, perversion.
They don't care about the people who hurt them, who mistake him for power and control, what they want is power and control, we can't give them."
He said, the Democrats are willing to "oppose and prevent."
"And you can see that in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "an angry and greedy and perverse people and liars."
He cited a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who is Dianne Feinstein by name, which led the audience to smear him.
"You remember his answer?
Did you expose a document in the wrong way?
Uh, uh, what it is.
No, not, I waited for one - that was the weakest body language - the worst language I've ever witnessed."
The Lebanese Party is no longer a church to live in.
It does not tolerate free thought
When Momentum activists in the local party voted to remove me, it was not very strange.
After all, I am one of the line of the Lebanese Parliamentarians to be told that we are not wanted - all by saying our thoughts.
My partner in parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she stood for her rebellion against Jewish discrimination.
In my case, the proposal to remove me was appalled by disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of an appropriate economic policy, on national security, on the European issue, it is critical that the issues are similar to those that Jeremy differs from previous leaders.
A statement to the Lebanese conference in Nottingham East on Friday explained that "we want the meetings to be lively and productive."
For over eight years as a regional Lebanese MP, Friday night GC meetings have been inclusive of that altogether.
Unfortunately today, it didn't look like many meetings and the political promise of "gentle, generous" has long been forgotten if, indeed, it had begun.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not accepted in the Leba Party and all views are treated as well as being accepted by the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as a colleague whom I was thinking sharing the same political outlook he started expecting me to completely change ideas and take up positions that I would never have agreed with - whether it's about national security or a single market in the European Union.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I'm saying - what follows is an insult on social media and an effort to want me not to be elected, reject intermediate politics, and tell me that I shouldn't be in the Lebanese party.
And it's not the situation I've gone through by myself.
Certainly, I know I'm more lucky than my other colleagues because the views directed at me are political.
I have a lot of respect for the skill and expression of my colleagues who are subjected to sexual insults or color every day but never give up.
One of the most frustrating aspects of contemporary politics is how abuse rates are considered commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Leba party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer a judiciary church and for each discussion a "lack of confidence" or a change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower in suffrage.
I've received a lot of advice over the past two years being urged to settle down, not to talk too much and that "I'll be fine."
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Ever since I joined the Lebanese party 32 years ago as a school student, due to the impetus of neglect by the Thatcher government that left the class of my full school almost collapsed, I have strived to fight for better public services for those who need it most â€“ be it a regional councillor or a government minister.
I have not hidden the forms of my politics, including in the previous election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused about attitudes in policy and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who brought forward the debate on Friday, all I will say is that when the country is about to leave the European Union almafier Brexit, a move that will hurt our family, our business and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Lebanese party.
But indeed one message of mine is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to the citizens in my area, whether or not the members of the Lebanese party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that there is no amount of threat to being purged or politically correct will prevent me from considering what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's undefeated team takes first place in the table
Two attempts in the final time may have changed to some extent the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this highly anticipated thrilling match of the Tennis League.
They are now leading the table, the only team that has not been defeated.
Ultimately, it was their best defence , as well as the use of their positions, which helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie was entitled to satisfaction.
"We have been tried in our games so far, and have not yet failed, so I must be happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they used their best chances to replace it."
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, scored by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but a yellow card for Scottish team player Rory Hughes, issued for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of multiplayer possession and Jason Baggot scored an unassisted try.
Climo increased Ayr's lead for the penalties, just before the break, scored and then completed a solo try and made the score 17â€“5 for Ayr during the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half with Patrick Anderson's attempt, it was blocked by Baggot, reducing the lead by five points.
Then the game was temporarily stopped after a dangerous injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was removed as the game was renewed, Ayr added his lead to a Stafford McDowall try, tied by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again, Melrose used the opportunity to have one more player and tied for Bruce Colvine's attempt, the end of a period of intense pressure.
The home team took control again, however, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for playing against Climo without a ball and from the penalties line out, MacPherson scored due to a severe attack from Ayr.
Climo scored, the way he was doing after the game started again, after Kyle Rowe collected a David Armstrong kick and scored Gregor Henry and scored the fifth try for the home team.
"'Still Game' star takes new job in restaurant sector".
<0x51>uiet Game star Ford Kieran appears to have entered the housing sector after it was discovered that he has been appointed as the director of a certified restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star plays Jack Jarvis on a popular show in the BBC, in which he is the writer and co-star of his longtime collaborator Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the next series of nine will be the last in the show and Kiernan apparently has another plan in life after Craiglang .
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish newspaper Sun claimed that Kiernan was expecting to be involved in the "growing business of the restaurant "in Glasgow."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia which has no port Hope that the court will open access to the Pacific
The crew patrols at the sea headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings carry a blue flag like the ocean.
The marine stations from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are inscribed with the expression: "The sea is ours in the right.
Restoring it is a duty."
Throughout portless Bolivia, the memory of the coastal belt that lost it to Chile in the 19th century resource crisis is still as clear - just as the desire to travel again in the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps the hopes are now the highest for many years, with Bolivia awaiting the verdict of an international court of justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has speed, a spirit of unity and tranquility and indeed has expectations of a positive outlook for results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The majority of Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on a large screen across the country, claiming that the court in The Hague will issue a ruling that accepts Bolivia's claims - after decades of appropriate talks - Chile will be forced to discuss a move to give Bolivia a sea access.
Evo Morales, the natural president of Bolivia - who is facing a heated confrontation in next year's re-election - also has much to do with Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed in late August.
But other critics believe that there is little chance that the court will give the decision you are good for Bolivia - and that there will be very little change even if it is decided.
The organisation based in the Netherlands has no authority to award Chile's territory to other countries, and has said that it cannot determine the outcome of the talks expected to take place.
The ICJ's decision will be handed down just six months after the final debate signaled that the case "is not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate , Chile's expert in international law.
And besides promoting Bolivia's optimism, the last four years may have brought it back.
"The issue of sea access is being exploited by the current Bolivian regime," said Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate .
Morales' political remarks have ended Chile's remaining goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will continue the talks, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9> , a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court decisions were too rapid.
Monday will give Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of varying years of mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in the Southern United States - was using the maritime issue as a political channel.
"Bolivia will never give up on its right to reach the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to realize that we need to go forward."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be possible unless it has faith in the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation will never withdraw its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the promises it made during a meeting in Singapore between opposition leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to re-establish a nuclear diplomacy that had been unsuccessful for more than three months after a meeting with North Korean president Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "little dream" that promoting sanctions and U.S. opposition to the report ending the Korean War will ever weaken the North.
Washington is afraid to accept information without Pyongyang first to make necessary disarmament measures.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump both want a second meeting.
But it is highly doubtful that Pyongyang is considering the disarmament that the country considers as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to host the second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris shows modern headpieces heading to the Royal Stores near you
If you want to increase the collection of your hats or completely block the sun then you have chosen a solution.
Experts Valentino and Thom Browne launched huge headphones in their collection SS19 in a stage show that surprised them with design at the Fashion Week in Paris.
The hats that are hard to create have attracted many on Instagram this summer and these designers have released these beautiful hats to be used on the fashion platform.
Valentino's most striking hood consisted of a tan hat set on broad edges resembling furs that covered the heads of the models.
Other large-scale tools include the models of an intruder, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple â€“ but they are not designed to heat your head.
Thom Browne also exposed the incredible boom - by the time Halloween is approaching.
Most coloured balconies had stitched lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter than fashion skills
One design was similar to a Skyuba-style device with a hose and glasses, while the other was similar to a melted ice cream cone.
And if you're going to go on with a great fashion statement - you're lucky.
Fashion spectators predict that large hoods can be on their way to supermarkets near you.
Extremely large hats give creativity in 'La Bomb', a straw hat with the edges of a two-hit width and sends everyone to wear it from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The lebo followers developed this complex hat that was released on social media made another high-performance design to be used in a fashion platform - a professional bag of size that uses a swimwear model
The orange raffia bag, placed raffia on the edge and leather handle, was the main attraction at the Jacquemus' La Riviera conventions of SS19 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I'm looking forward to seeing big hats and backpacks arrive at the mall next summer - because the architect has brought a huge impact that will be difficult to ignore the needs of big equipment.'
John Edward: Linguistic knowledge is important for international citizens
The independent schools of Scotland continue to maintain a record of professional skills and this has continued throughout 2018 with another set of best test results, which are reinforced by personal and collective achievements in sports, arts, music and other community efforts.
Despite an increase of over 30,000 students in Uskoti, these schools, represented by the Council of Independent Schools in Uskoti (almaa popular SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to provide their students with more and higher education, the professions they choose and their position as international citizens.
As an educational sector that can create and implement a special school curriculum, we see modern languages becoming popular and a preferred subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his native language it goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exam, we can see that languages are leading the league table with grade levels in independent schools.
A total of 68<0x25> of foreign language learners received an A grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72<0x25> of students obtained a High A in Mandarin and 72<0x25> for those who learn German, 69<0x25> for those who learn French and 63<0x25> for those who learn Spanish also got an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will need in their future.
Languages now, as a selective subject, are considered to the same degree as STEM classes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school courses and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the British Commission on Employment and Skills found that one of the reasons employers said they find when they have difficulty filling jobs, 17<0x25> was associated with a lack of language skills .
So more and more, language skills become essential to providing young people with their future professions.
While many job opportunities are needed language, this knowledge is essential in the world of globalization.
Regardless of the profession that one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will find a more realistic place in the future to have the knowledge of life like this.
Being able to communicate directly with foreign people will put a multilingual person at the forefront of competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75<0x25> were unable to speak a foreign language well to develop conversations in French which is the only language spoken by a percentage of double digits, 15<0x25>.
This is why investing in language training is now important for current children.
Having multiple languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within the Scots, each school will have a different teaching language.
Several schools will take into account more modern languages, where some will teach languages that seem more important to Britain in the future until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be several languages to choose in independent schools, as well as professionals in this field.
The independent schools of Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will provide children and provide them with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of their future professions.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in the context of international trade, that languages are becoming very important to the future of the country, so this should be shown in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as "international communication knowledge."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, contrasting with quality for the young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Council of Independent Schools in Scotland
LeBron played his first game with the Lakers Sunday at San Diego
The wait time is almost over for fans eager to see LeBron James play their first match as a player for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a pre-season match on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than a minute and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers official website.
Lakers writer Mike Trudell explained in a tweet that James can play a few minutes.
Following rehearsals earlier this week, James was asked about his plans on the Lakers' schedule of "six preseason games.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my game to be ready," he said.
Trump's Political Forum in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five meetings scheduled to take place next week, including standing in areas where he has many supporters including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the affirmative vote still suspended about who appointed him to fill the Supreme Court position, Trump aims to create support in the election as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes will be held in November.
How many hours will Trump's meeting in West Virginia be and how can you watch it online?
Trump Summit in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 1 p.m. Eastern Time Tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch West Virginia's Trump conference online via a live stream on YouTube.
There is a possibility Trump will talk about a case to be held this week about Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh, which has caused much concern over allegations of sexual abuse that led to a temporary suspension of the Senate confirmation vote for one week while the FBI is conducting an investigation.
But the goal of this rallies lineup is to vote for the Republican candidates in the November election to gain more popularity.
As such, President Trump's campaign committee said these five meetings in the coming week are aimed at empowering volunteers and supporters as the Republican Party is trying to protect and expand the majority of seats in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Senate's control is important to his agenda so the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach a more active campaign season," a Trump campaign committee spokesman who refused recognition told Reuters.
Originally scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, tonight's conference can bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and the broadcasting of the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia's Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state that he won with over 40<0x25> of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the poll vote.
"It's not a good sign to Morrisey that the president must arrive to try to improve his position in the election," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA shows commitment to maintaining hope towards a one-man game on Sunday
After three rounds in the same direction, a game of two to two Saturday afternoon players can be a thrill that the Ryder Cup needs
The titular flexibility course is a fully developed concept of games but which players believe in truth and even more in tournaments such as
So where are they going to say speed now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we take it as a little faster I think," said Jordan Spieth after the day ended.
Europe have the best chances, of course, ahead by four points, with twelve remaining to be knocked out.
Americans, as Spieth points out, feel that they have extra energy and have a lot to encourage them, also considering Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together throughout the day and everyone is proud of three out of four.
Spieth has been dangerous from the beginning of the game to the game's hole and leads by being a role model.
The many cheerleading pitches increased as his turn continued, tying the ball after hitting the ball towards the hole and balancing as he and Thomas were down with two points after two turns.
His ball-to-hole shot earned them a 15-hole match and got a lot of cheerleading noise, which shows you believe the American team is not dead yet.
"You really have to act hard and consider your own match," Spieth said.
Now that's all these players are left to do now.
Eighteen holes are waiting for them to show it.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unexplained story of the Ryder Cup.
The amazing pair from Europe has four out of four points and they have currently made no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that did not hit the ball more times on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided hitting the ball more times on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and in the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
That quality, and how their strength seems to increase between them and the crowd shows that the players are the ones who will offer the highest level of competition on Sunday and there are probably no other elite players who can win for Europe when the day ends at Le Golf National if not Fleetwood or Molinari.
Good if all will do this at the same time in different holes.
It is very early to discuss victory for Europe, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson faced each other accordingly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning in a two-on-one game, when he formed a pair with Alex Noren.
The extra ball and two more balls in the nine opening holes put the Spaniard and the Swede in a situation that was hard to come from.
On Sunday, however, no one can get you out of the way.
The two-to-two game is very exciting to watch closely due to the cooperation between the pair, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how the strategy can change on the spot.
Europe has done much better as a team so far and took a great lead towards the final day but this period of pairing against pairs has also shown that the US team has a fighting one that some, especially those in the United States, questioned.
Europe lead by 10â€“6 in the Ryder Cup on the final day
Europe would have a good chance in the Ryder Cup final after winning in a pair match and four balls to 10â€“6 against the United States.
The pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the game with two wins against Tiger Woods who seemed overwhelmed and put their total score to date at Le Golf National as four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, battling the rest of the tournament that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, led the United States that appeared to be overwhelmed in a four-ball morning game, winning the series 3â€“1.
The United States provided more opposition in pairs' matches and won two matches, but were unable to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to stay with the tournament.
Fleetwood is the first new player in Europe to win four consecutive points when he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a thrilling weekend became only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four- ball match they teamed well and defeated Wood and American Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who was back in both matches on Saturday, showed periods of good play but has now lost 19 of 29 matches in four balls and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who rested for a match of four balls in the morning, returned to team up with Henrik Stenson in a pair match and lost 2 and 1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who were listed in first and third place in the world.
Europe didn't get everything though the day was good, with an impressive wind in southwest Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the pattern for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won 2nd and 1st against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball match and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4th and 3rd in a pair game after losing two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has the team managed to move from behind by four points to a one-man game, though Furyk's team only needs to get out of uniform to stay with the shell.
After being in second place for two days, however, the fight to win on Sunday seems to be going to be away from them.
North Korea says 'impossible' will remove weapons without the belief that others will do what they should.
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was further undermining distrust of the United States and no way could the country remove its nuclear weapons without others doing what they should under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had taken "good measures of goodwill" the previous year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, breaking the nuclear test facility and promising not to overload nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any faith from the United States there will be no confidence in our national security in such a situation and no way will we remove our weapons first without others doing what they should."
While Ri again stressed North Korea's complaints regarding Washington's "step-by-step" approach by removing nuclear weapons in which North Korea would find a remedy taking a small step, his report was seen as important as it did not reject the move to remove nuclear weapons on conditional how Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in the first meeting between the current U.S. President and North Korean leader Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work "to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure North Korea's safety.
North Korea has been seeking an official solution to the 1950â€“53 Korean war, but the United States says Pyongyang must remove its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected calls to end international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists" first on the removal of nuclear weapons" and is increasing the amount of pressure by using sanctions to achieve their goal in a way of forcing and even opposing "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The view that barriers may not weaken is an impossibility dream from people who ignore us.
But the problem is that ongoing sanctions promote mistrust.
"Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump which the US leader alluded to at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead illuminated three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If a partner in this issue of removing nuclear sleep would have been South Korea and not the United States, nuclear disarmament from the Korean peninsula would not have been in this bad condition."
However, Ri's speech was somewhat different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the move to target the United States mainland and North Korean rockets would not be inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump referred to Kim as a "rocket man" with the aim of carrying out the killings.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking measures to disarm, but said a major job should still be done and sanctions should remain until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia say the United Nations Security Council should accuse Pyongyang of its actions.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue in detail and without failure until we have a complete, final and proven nuclear disarmament."
Together, the Security Council has increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to withdraw funds for the Pyongyang nuclear and missile plans.
Pompeo met with Ri after the UN General Assembly later said that he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his final tour did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but only within hours North Korea accused him of giving "assassins as a criminal."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy both the missile base and the nuclear weapons center if the United States is taking "related measures."
She said Kim had told her that the "related measures" she wanted are a security guarantee that Trump promised while in Singapore and towards strengthening relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught a lesson in getting enough rest.
This year's new lesson at Harvard University requires all undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to fight the culture of masculinity and read for 'all night' with coffee assistance.
â€˜The expert discovered students at the world's number one university don't have the knowledge on the basic issue of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the subject, which he believes to be the first type in the United States.
.He was included to create a lesson after giving a lecture about how insomnia affects training.
'At the end of the speech, one girl came to me and said: 'Why am I just told these things now, in my last year?'
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep â€“ which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The lesson, which is first introduced this year, explains the basics of how good sleep styles help with academic and sporting activities as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and managing director of university health care, said that the university decided to start the subject after discovering that students had fallen asleep too much during the week.
This hourly lesson involves a series of shared activities.
In one section there is a picture of the bedroom, where students press for coffee, curtains, shoes and books and describe the effects of coffee and light and how sports activities are affected by insomnia and the importance of sleep schedule.
In other sections, participants are told how long-term insomnia can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, malnutrition and cancer.
The college map and the associated icon, then urges participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know the lesson won't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the harm to health when you smoke,' Professor Czeisler added.
The pride culture in 'awakening' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means lack of sleep was an ongoing problem.
To make sure you get enough sleep, good quality, you should be the student's 'secret weapon' to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the mind in a state of dissatisfaction and makes you hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California studying physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create a subject, having participated in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the lesson opened his eyes and gave him a chance to form an entire college class.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to do a corresponding lesson before joining a highly competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should pay attention to keeping both a sleeping bell and a wake-up bell and be aware of the effects of the 'blue moon' produced by electric screens and LED lights, which can damage the brain's clock and cause sleep disorders.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's bao swam Gerrard's youngsters
The Rangers were defeated again in another inning game when a Dolly Menga kick was stolen from Steven Gerrard's team that appeared to be overwhelmed by a 1â€“0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team had been intending to secure their first win in the tournament since a 4â€“1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team resulted in Gerrard losing for the second time in 18 games as manager and leaving his team eight points behind the leaders of the Ladbrokes League, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break and Rangers never looked like it would equalise.
As the Rangers now go down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and is just behind Hibernian for a sharp contrast.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after flagship Calum Spence needed medical treatment after a head injury to an object fired from Rangers supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that tied Ayr in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used all 11 players who got a uniform against Hearts last week and will be happy with how well-prepared his team faced their opponents every time.
The Rangers mostly owned the ball but Livingston took advantage of their chances when they got the ball.
They were only to score in the second minute when the first ball of the Menga gave Scott Pittman a chance to head to Allan McGregor's gate but the link threw the ball out.
A cab ball from Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but defence partner Alan Lithgow was only able to hit it out of goal.
The Rangers took control but their game seemed just believing but not self-confidence as they approached the shutout area.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he would have to get the penalties in the 15th minute after being hit by Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson said the game should continue even after the Colombian claim.
Rangers were able to score two touchdowns in the goal during the first half but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly would not have suffered much of a header ball from Lassana Coulibaly and a weak kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's goal in the 34th minute did not come from the regular game, no one would deny that they deserved the victory.
Again the Rangers were unable to cope with a cab ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallagher cleared the ball for Scott Robinson, who was tight and hitting the ball towards Menga who touched and scored.
Gerrard made the decision during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the point hio was about to get the result when the link pinned the ball for Morelos but Kelly ran out of his place and blocked the ball.
But Livingston continued to upset the visitors and made them play as they wanted, with Lithgow and Halkett hitting a long ball after.
Holt's team could add a goal in the final minutes but McGregor was tight and blocked Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball out to the head.
Rangers player Glenn Middleton had other penalties in the last minutes when they faced Jacobs but again referee Thomson dismissed a request away.
Shajara of the Year: inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now page from our annual "Sunday Morning" shajara: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and continued TODAY ... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, an exploration that ultimately led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger Counter.
The foundation of science since then, the Geiger Counter became prominent in the popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bell of Coronado," which included scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man: "What's that in this world?"
Rogers: "It's a Counter Geiger device, it's used to detect minerals of meteorites, such as uranium.
When installing these headers, you can hear the effects of atoms produced by a consumer in the mineral."
Evans: "Say, it's starting to sound now!"
Hans "Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But an invention named after him survives.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells and kill them
Vaccination teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The technique involves cooling the immune cells from the patient, replacing them in the laboratory
Then they can 'see' the protein that is popular in most cancers and then re-establish.
Experimental vaccination shows positive outcomes in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with vaccination, which teaches the immune system to detect bad cells, was able to treat her ovarian cancer for over 18 months.
This method involves cooling the immune cells from the patient, replacing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the normal protein for most HER2 cancers, and then re-placing the cells.
. Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Saturn Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very reliable vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovarian, lung and gut and nose, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching them" how targeting cancer cells has worked in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West Has Began a Long and Bitter Test of Supporting Trump, Wearing a MAGA hat, After appearing in the SNL show.
It didn't go Well.
Kanye Kanye West was bitten in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a high-profile show where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he could qualify for office in 2020.
After a performance of his third song that night, Ghost Town where he was wearing a hat written Make America Great, he began scolding the Democrats and pledged support for Trump.
"When I talk to a white man often says: "How can you love Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show began with a brief sequel that included Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee on Sexual Abuse allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the episode was not broadcast, West's content was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock tried to sarcasticize West with the publication.
West had also complained to the audience that he had a difficult time before entering the stage with regard to his hat.
"They treated me badly backstage.
They said, 'don't go there with that hat.'
They bullied me!
And then they said I'm in a situation where I'm drowning," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see a place to sink?" saying that he will wear my heroic hat, because this means you can't tell me what I'm supposed to do. You want the world to go ahead?
Try love."
His comments challenged him to be at least doubled from an audience by the SNL staff who seemed embarrassed, the Variety Center reported, and one person there reporting the publication: "The entire studio went completely silent."
West had been brought in to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former lover, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many when he sang the song I Love It, dressed as Perrier's Water Bottle.
West was joined by conservative group leader TPUSA, Candace Turner who published the tweet: "For one of the bravest: ASANTE FOR LIFE AND UMMA."
But talk show host Karen Hunter published a tweet that West was just "showing his point of view and that's an excellent thing."
"But I choose to KEY another person (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe agrees to spread the ideology that is dangerous to my community.
He has freedom.
Even us too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has changed to Snoop Lion and of course the late Prince musician, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington rebukes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington starred as Jon Snow in the HBO reality series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31 years old, has rebuked those who have opium of so much masculinity, saying those roles on screen mean little boys often feel like they should be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'there's something that's ruined in place' and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted feeling 'plenty' in dealing with this issue.
'I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment - where have we erred in the matter of masculinity?', he said.
'What have we been teaching men as they grow up, according to the issue of the problem we see now?'
'Kit believes that television can be a part of an increase in toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
He continued: 'What's natural and what's taught?
Is that what is taught on television, and on the streets, which makes little boys feel they should be this kind of man?
I think that's one of the big questions at the time we live in - how are we going to change that?
Because things are definitely going out of our youth.
In an interview he also admitted that he would no longer be involved in the pre-season and follow-up episodes of Game of Thrones when the series ends next season, saying he is satisfied with the battlefield and the horse.
From November Kit will be involved in films from Sam Shepard's book True West which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a thief.
The character recently revealed that the point of meeting his wife Rose was best due to her involvement in the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on this show, through that I got my family later, and my life from there,' he said.
Rose starred as Ygritt , the love interest of the character Jon Snow who played as Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The lovers married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie Scotland's family.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14<0x25> increase in new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Many of the new episodes were caused by sex, signaling changes from the past.
Typically, HIV spread rapidly to other regions of China due to blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had decreased to zero, Chinese health leaders said at a meeting in Yunnan province.
. However, year after year, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV infections are a serious issue in the LGBT community in China.
Same-sex love in China was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be too high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70â€“90<0x25> of men in same-sex sex eventually marry women.
Most of the infections come from a lack of immunity during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged access to all HIV drugs as part of an effort to address this issue.
Maxine Waters denied that her staffer disclosed GOP senators' data, rebuked 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday denied claims that her staffer published a personal profile of three Republican senators on the Senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Demokrat MP from Los Angeles said that the allegations were being circulated by analysts and websites of "serious right-wing supporters".
"A lie, a lie, and more meaningless lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The comments made allegedly include home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
Comments appeared online Thursday, published by an anonymous man on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on charges of sexual abuse charges against Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure occurred a few moments after the Senators denounced Kavanaugh.
Conservative areas such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that an IP address that recognizes the source of publications was associated with the Waters office and provided a Waters employee's description, Hill reported.
"These unfounded claims are completely false and completely misleading," Waters continued.
"My employee - whose identity, personal details, and security have been affected by these allegations of fraud and falsehood - was never involved in exposing these details.
These unfounded claims are completely false and completely misleading."
Waters' report was quickly hacked online, including the former Information Minister at the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he has no proper emotional control to become a Congressional Commissioner.
When someone is being humiliated for something he doesn't act, he shouldn't be angry.
There should be no worries.
He should not question the motives of the dissident.
He should be calm and uneasy.
"Fleischer was seen as comparing Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats against Justice Kavanaugh, who was criticized by critics for appearing angry at a hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who contends to remove Waters from representative elections, also published his thoughts on Twitter.
"The big thing if it's true," he said to the tweet.
In a statement, Waters said his office had informed "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators of this act are exposed, "continued," and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all my employees."
Johnny English film review Strikes Again - a joke on Rowan Atkinson's wretched detective
It is not uncommon to look at Brexit's effects in any new film leaning towards the UK but that does not apply to the warmth of another comedy-war with a comedy by Johnny English - which began in 2003 by Johnny English and came back in 2011 by Johnny English Reborn.
Is the humor of a personal joke on the topic of how reckless we're going to be a new opportunity abroad?
At any rate, Johnny English's eye-catching, highly moving face has a license to re-introduce errors in a re-arranged way for the second time - the name further reflects his sign that he is designed with a broader sense of humor for non-English-speaking people.
He is indeed a chizi detective who despite the strange demands for an interesting attraction reflects the qualities of Clouseau, the qualities of Mr Bean and the person who contributed one of the scene music to the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
He was initially involved as a traveller and international man Atkinson was at one time involved in Barclaycard TV's now forgotten broadcasts, leaving many if not interested.
There's one or two things in this recent JE film.
I liked to see Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a jade suit of armor and flash flats changing over time on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent in physical comedy was reflected here, but the humor seems inferior and unnecessary, hussan because "big" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible include humor as part of it.
The comic appears to be aiming at children and not adults and wrestling with me Johnny English's unique adventures are not creative and has no focus on how silent Atkinson's comedy as the character Bean.
The annual assumption at present is that Britain is in great trouble.
A cyber raider has managed to get into a secret British internet network and uncover the identity of all British spies outside the workplace and surprise the detective on the job â€“ unfortunately it was a very easy role for Kevin Eldon.
In his last time as a proud prince he faces so much opposition and has already been completely affected in political fame: Emma Thompson does very well with her character comparable to Teresa May but the story does not help him portray these qualities.
His security advisors inform him that because the identity of each spy has been disclosed, he must use a retired person.
And that means using Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a school teacher at a high school, but teaches informal lessons about how to be a secret detective: some good humour there, while English teaches a detective similar to the film School of Rock.
English is reintroduced to Whitehall by an emergency meeting and reunited with his former partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, he is associated with a fleet commander, an adventure where Vicki Pepperdine hasn't been involved should.
Thus the characters corresponding to Batman and Robin but with vandalism in the Kingdom Secret Service return to work and reconcile with Olga Kurylenko who plays Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister appears to be more involved in the spying of a fanfare who claims he can solve all the technology problems in the United Kingdom: Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their most enjoyable journey : they pretend to be hoteliers, ignite a fire at a French grandstand; they start a riot and enter without permission in a Volta luxury boat; and English causes a kashe as he tries to use the equipment of Improved Reality to learn the interior of a Volta boat.
All breaks have been omitted for the latter sequence, but regardless of the catchphrase and turbulence interspersed, there are so many characteristics of children's programming in the film hi.
Better snugly.
And just as there are other Johnny English films I had to ask again: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
The Lebanese party denies that it has a plan for the British to work four days but be paid for five days.
The Lebanese party led by Jeremy Corbyn will consider a strict deal that the British will work four days a week - but be paid five days.
The party allegedly wants corporate leaders to pay the money saved through artificial intelligence (AI) to employees for giving them an extra day.
It will keep workers growing and three days of rest - but they will still go home with the same income.
Sources said that the idea would be "fit" for the party's economic agenda and plans to strengthen the country for workers.
Working four days a week has been supported by the Workers' Union Centre as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
The main source of the Lebanese Party told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen once but the four working days are aligned with the party's view in balancing the economy for the workers and also the party's overall strategy for the sector.'
'The Lebanese Party will not be the first to propose such an idea, the Green Party promised four working days a week during its 2017 general election campaign.
Ari hio is currently not supported by both in the Lebanese Party, however.
A spokesperson for the Lebanese Party said: 'Four working days a week is not a party policy and has not been taken into account by the party.'
Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Lebanese conference to describe his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he had the determination to remove authority from 'invisible directors' and 'self-employed' in service companies.
Chansela's alternative plan also means that current stakeholders in water companies will not be able to reimburse all of their funds because the Lebanese Government can make 'submissions' on the grounds of identified offences.
He also confirmed that plans to put employees on company boards and create Ownership Funds to provide 10<0x25> of private companies' money to employees, who will have an annual turnover of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy explain the episode "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation against Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI investigation into the lawsuit against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised a question as to whether the FBI's findings could alter Republican senators' opinions to support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Senators.ca Republicans John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI can find anything that could cause them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared to be more open than his partner from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said heading to the trial, I said, I've spoken to Justice Kavanaugh.
"I called him after this happened, when the allegations surfaced, I said, 'Did you do that?'"
He was stable, awkward and accurate."
However, Graham's vote seems unchanged.
"I've already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and it's going to take very serious charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly refused," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford."
"And everyone involved couldn't prove.
It's 36 years now.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the World Citizens Festival and Has It Do Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizens' Festival, a music event that includes an interesting list of singing stars as well as an equally interesting message; ending global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizen's Festival will send tens of thousands to the Great Lawn at Central Park not only to enjoy stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness for the true purpose of the event to eliminate the extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which stated in 2012 that it is a continuation of the Global Poverty Initiative, an international advocacy group looking to end poverty by increasing the number of people facing each other directly against it.
In order to get a free event ticket (except if you would like to pay a VIP ticket), concert supporters had to complete a series of activities, or "acts" such as volunteering, sending emails to a global leader, calling or any other effort to help increase awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how has the World Citizens Festival been successful with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of lobbying people with free concert tickets a realistic way to persuade people to push for action, or simply another case of what is known as "just online activism" - people feel like they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the World Citizens Festival states that it has leased over 19 million "acts" from its adherents to different targets.
It says these actions have pushed world leaders to declare <0x24>37 billion promises and policies that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, this group showed 390 promises and advertisements based on its actions, at least <0x24>10 billion that have already been distributed or donated.
The group estimates the funds available so far have directly affected around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and donors in the United Kingdom aiming to "help children reach their full potential," promising to donate 35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the World Citizens.
"With help from the UK government, donors, national governments, and World Citizens like you, we can make the social bullying of not having the best nutrition to be history only," the Ambassador for Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after over 5,000 acts were completed in petitioning the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and better nutrition.
In response to a question in the <0x51>uestions and Answers section on its website that asked "what makes you think we can eliminate the most extreme poverty?"
Citizens of the World Citizens Festival replied: It's going to be a long and hard way - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, with human rights activists and anti-racist groups in front of us, we will succeed, because we are strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the stars who will sing at the event in New York, which locals will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use the Navy to "block" Russian exports of energy - Minister of the Interior
Washington may "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from being sold, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of Home Affairs Ryan Zinke has said, as described by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular, where it works at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason for them that the Middle East is to find energy markets as they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and techniques to deal with that.
"The United Nations has that power, as well as our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are opened, and, if necessary, to prevent, to ensure that their energy doesn't reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing members who attended the event organized by the League of Users Energy, a non-profit group that says it represents the "voice of energy users" in the United States.
He went on to compare the methods Washington uses to deal with Russia and Iran, and said that those countries are similar.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, accordingly, in terms of consumption and replacement of oil," he said, referring to Russia as "with limited knowledge" and an economy based on coal oil.
The reports come at a time when the Trump administration has been on a mission to increase its natural gas sales to Europe and replace Russia, which has become a very affordable option for European users.
Consequently, Trump administration leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project of "Nord Stream 2," which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Nord Stream 2's 11 billion pipeline, which aims to double the current capacity of 110 billion m2, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin says that much of Washington's opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy is not suitable as a tool to do pressure and that users should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has been stifled by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German organisation in the sector, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to abstain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country is interfering with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "Will Look Deeply" to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she could "look into detail" if she ran for the presidency after a representative vote.
During a meeting at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman in power," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will look into detail if I run for president."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city hall, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned within myself about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been speaking extensively about his opposition to Trump and his Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet he published on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
"The poll released on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of voters in the Warren area do not feel that he should run in 2020.
59<0x25> of "possible" voters in Massachusetts said a senator should not run, according to Suffolk University's Political Research University/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported a similar candidate.
The survey showed further support for former Governor Deval Patrick's nomination, with 38<0x25> supporting and 48<0x25> rejecting.
Other notable names of Democrats considered to have the potential to run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide before January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites stress caused by a traumatic incident to Track Palin at Donald Trump's
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after being registered in September.
He was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through when I'm back, I can understand other families that are going through the effects of traumatic trauma and some of the effects our soldiers have come back with," he told an audience at a Donald Trump meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin cited the move to arrest him as being "an avoidable puzzle" and said that his son and the rest of the war veterans, "are coming back different, come back with a hard ideology, come back wondering if there is an honor that they are astronauts and every other military ally, for his dedication to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and influenced the report of domestic abuse and possession of weapons while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, DC support new immigration policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal opposition to a new U.S. policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing crime or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a small friend-of-a-kind report on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers in opposition to policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace v. Sessions which was submitted by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union held in August against state policy has not been disclosed.
He said his boyfriend "and his sons co-defendants," persecuted him but U.S. officials rejected his asylum request on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Country lawyers supporting Grace described the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which provide a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as nations facing problems with organized crime and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed the 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board which allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to be granted asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a Friday report that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, state and international law."
"The law of the country requires that all asylum claims be determined in accordance with the facts and specific circumstances of the claim, and the denial violates the principle," said a friend-of-law.
Further lawyers said in a statement that the policy prohibiting immigrants from entering negatively affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and "provide essential services."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer offer asylum for victims who fled domestic violence and crime groups in June.
"A refuge is available to those fleeing their country because of bullying or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a group of communities or political views," Sessions said in a June 11 announcement about the policy.
The act of asylum was not meant to solve all the problems - even all the major problems - that people face every day around the world.
Most rescue efforts in Palu as the number of disasters doubled in the race for survivors,
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It looks terrible," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her influenza child at a rescue facility in the city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulance brings bodies.
Fresh water is not readily available."
"Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, taking wet equipment, trying to save anything they could get.
Hundreds of people were injured while hospitals, damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, had lost control of the sick population.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture in his back and shoulder, when they buried him outside Palu Army Hospital , where patients were being treated outside due to the continuity of later tremors.
Tears filled his eyes with memorizing how a strong quake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where they had a wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I pressed in the rubble of the walls, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in the town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'terrorism' via 'propaganda ads'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in the U.S. that highlighted the mutual benefits of US and Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American journalists to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the addition of a Chinese Daily tribute hike to the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the State of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the election of the U.S. delegation on November 6, a claim that China has rejected.
Trump's claims that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections show what U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's fast-paced campaigns to push for China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to set up advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently facing each other in a trade war that has led to an increase in the rate of taxation of each other's products.
China's early paid tribute to trade was created to influence exporters from states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing adversely affected U.S. workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now reduces the bullying by posting propaganda advertisements to the free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a method that has been sponsored by the United States of America for freedom of opinion and free information by posting paid advertisements on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In comparison, on the street newspaper sections in Beijing, you will find very few voices offer resistance and you will not be able to see the real situation and the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's troublesome economic goals, considering that the media is closely controlled by the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most famous newspapers refused to publish" his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Separating Women Voters Toward the Age of Representative Voters Using the Kavanaugh Conflict, analyst Warn
While many supporters advocated for the appointee to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of a number of sexual abuse allegations, critics have warned that they will receive negative results, especially from women, during representative elections.
The feelings surrounding this have been very high and many of the Republicans openly expressed that they wanted to continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he is concerned that last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI investigation would be enough to appease voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday â€” they won't forget tomorrow and even all November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the MovementOn development group said on Friday, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they marched along the Senate highway when the Republicans reaffirming the Court Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The influence and motivation of the Democrats has exceeded expectations", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political commentator, told the news website.
"People say it's already reached a high point; that's true.
But it can be higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who when they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public evidence that described sexual abuse against the Supreme Court's appointee, critics said adverse results could follow if the Republicans continue and confirm.
"This has been a lottery for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Republican Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or if Kavanaugh is to be nominated, it's also about the way the Republicans have dealt with this and how they treated him ," Guy Cecil, director of Priories USA, a group helping to elect the Democrats, has said at the media center.
However, the Americans seem to have some division as to who is credible after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with many leaning on Kavanaugh.
New research from YouGov shows that 41<0x25> of participants were obvious or perhaps believed Ford's testimony, while 35<0x25> said it was obvious or perhaps believed Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38<0x25> said they thought Kavanaugh was outspoken or maybe lied during his testimony, while only 30<0x25> have said the same thing about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh abused him at the age of 17.
Ramirez states that the Supreme Court Selectman revealed his secret pieces when they attended a ceremony while they were at school at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web explorer plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of World Wide Web, is launching a new business that will offer competitiveness against Facebook, Amazon and Google
The technologist's most recent project, Inrupt, is a company that is created through the Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and people who are allowed access permissions to comment.
In a special interview with Fast company, Berners-Lee claimed that Inrupt's motive is "rule the world."
"We should do it now," he said in relation to the business.
"It's a historical moment."
Applications use Solid technology to allow people to create "personal data storage online" or POD.
It can include a contact list, a list of things to do, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Store, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on one web browser and at the same time.
And unique about personal data storage online is that only the user can access what type of profile.
The company refers to this as "personal access through data."
Inrupt's idea, according to Managing Director John Bruce, is for the company to bring in the right resources, process and knowledge to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee's Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the artists commissioned to create this project by a dedicated community of code-builders.
Starting this week, technology artists around the world can create their own one-party programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team have not spoken to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to initiate a complete change where all of their business models will be integrated in one night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
"In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's message is to provide commercial and environmental energy to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the network when he founded the World Wide Web Union at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has contributed more to the debate on having an independent website.
Even at the time of Inrupt's launch, Berners-Lee will remain a Member and Director of the Alliance of the World Wide Web, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Foundation.
"I'm optimistic about this web show," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest Who Won the Victoria Cross during WW1
The only British Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter has been celebrated in his town 100 years later.
Colonel Lutena Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 at the Siege of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a target raider four days later and never realised he had won the highest British military award.
The anniversary stone has been revealed by two of his grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it "is a wonderful example" that the stone is revealed 100 years in particular from his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Lutena Vann led his regiment along the Canal de Saint-<0x51>uentin "through heavy fog and heavy firing from field and rifle."
He later ran into the firing line and with "greater courage" led the line forward before using a field gun alone and targeting three weapons.
Colonel Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German targeting raider on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "acts that I know I can't reach but are very impressive."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also installed a crown of flowers after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "was feeling very polite to participate in the parade" and added "the courage of a real hero is shown with support from many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but found Peppa Pig instead,
Think about this, you've waited all night to watch Bellator 206 except to be rejected to watch the main event.
Bills from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were aired live all night in the United Kingdom via Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to get to know each other, viewers in the UK were left open mouths when the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Others were disappointed after staying awake until early hours especially for fighting.
A fan on Twitter described changing and labeling a children's cartoon as "some kind of horrible joke."
"It's a federal rule where it came at 6 a.m. the content was inappropriate so it had to change the programming to become children's," said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of Bellator Markets and Communications, when asked about the launch."
""Peppa the pig," "yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said that they will go to work on their schedule to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the frequency, I think we can probably consider this," Coker said.
"But now it's 6 a.m. Sunday there and we can't take this into consideration until Sunday our time, Monday when they are.
But we take it into account.
I believe, at the time it changed there was a lot of messages being sent and it didn't grow well.
We were trying to fix, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that in the future such a thing will not happen.
We'll put it in five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we tried to make an effort for the fans but failed.
It's an unexpected situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'poor' because of his sex
Olympic dive thrower Tom Daley says that he felt helpless due to his sex throughout his growing up â€“ but that gave him the motivation to succeed in life.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize that until he went to high school it was "I realized that not everyone is like me."
Speaking on a Radio 4 show at Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she says that she talked about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope."
He says that the move to parenthood made him less interested in winning at the Olympics.
The long-running show's producer, Kirsty Young, has been out for a period due to illness.
Participating as an outcast in Laverne's first episode, Daley states that she felt "some decline" over everyone of her age because it was "not accepted in a quirky way to love girls and boys."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of self-esteem and certain limitations, and feeling different from others are things that have given me strength and ability to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he could not discourage anyone when they finally discovered his sex.
The two-time bronze medalist placing the Olympics has been a prominent participant in LGBT support campaigns and was used to participate in ke at Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries not to consider same-sex marriage a crime.
He said he showed up because he felt lucky to be able to live without effect and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with another man - American filmmaker - Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "you got him unexpectedly."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is older than 20 years, last year but said that age gap has never been an issue.
"When you go through a lot at a very young age" - he went to the first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had gone through such things.
The couple became parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his attitude" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I just thought 'I need to win the gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
"Son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not admit that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they still got their Olympic tickets in London 2012 - because he wanted to be the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you can't go near the hio dad' row," he said.
"I had held her hand when she stopped breathing and had to stop breathing completely and die is what I believed she had failed," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had been dreaming of for the rest of my life - diving in front of a crowd of our people at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also encouraged his choice of first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had given him inspiration during the preparations for the Olympics and made him excited.
Desert Island Discs show airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST
Mickelson who has not played well is placed on the bench in Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his game so as not to reach the hio stage unhappily.
Mickelson, playing in the doubles event of the year and setting a 12-point playoff record, was placed on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for a four-wicket haul and a pair game.
Instead of being at the depth of the event, how often he was for the United States, this five-time grand finalist split his day between becoming a fan and practicing the sport in hopes of fixing his problem.
Never is the leader even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old player is not the right choice for a game at Le Golf National, which bad ball is repeatedly penalized.
And if the field is not enough reason, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces British champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with new player Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of this week's matches.
If the Americans, who are four points behind as they start a single 12-man match, have strong opposition, Mickelson's match can prove absolutely important.
Furyk showed courage in his man, not that he could say more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, he greets and embraces me and assures me he will be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great courage in his ability.
He is a celebrity and has contributed greatly to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably never saw him play two matches.
I expected him to play more, but that's what happened and that's the way we thought we should consider it.
He wants to be out there playing, just like anybody else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most matches in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It could be his last in playing the Ryder Cup that has never matched his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven uniforms, although Furyk said his presence brought some benefits to the team.
"He's funny, brave, he likes to joke about people and he's a good guy to have him on the team," he explained.
"I think that the bud players were also happy to fight him also this week, which was interesting to see.
He has more contribution than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the lead of scores may soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a great lead if it comes into the finals of the Ryder Cup could turn into a tense journey.
Debden played his first match in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros led by five points against the Americans but finished with a game-winning run, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2â€“131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but very close," said Bjorn, photographed, after watching the 2018 Class win 5â€“3 on Friday and yesterday and leading 10â€“6 at Le Golf National.
So history points to me and everyone on the team that the game is not over yet.
You're going to be more aggressive there tomorrow.
Go there and make sure you do things the way they should.
This game is not over until you get a score.
We aim and it's trying to win this tournament and that's what we're aiming for.
I've said this all the time, I'm focusing on 12 players who are on our team, but we're well aware of the quality of the opposing team - the best players in the world.
"Between by how his players did in a difficult field, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't be more hopeful than this in this.
Tomorrow is a very different day.
Tomorrow is a personal activity that you will decide and that is something different.
It's good to be out there with a partner when things are interesting, but when you're out there alone, then you're perfectly tested on your full potential as a golfer.
That's the message you need to tell the players, it's to act on your best tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner should go and act best independently, too.
"Unlike Bjorn, opposing team captain Jim Furyk will recommend his players will act better independently compared to when they played as allies, with the exception of Jordan and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was involved in the prestigious games on the final day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before finishing in defeat as Europe gained the "Miracle of Medina."
"I remember every word," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, brought together his players towards the final day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get a good start as it was at Brookline, as you saw at Medina.
When the pace goes the same way, it puts a lot of pressure on the intermediate matches.
We organized our players effectively and put people in a way that we felt we preferred, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in a high-profile match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the rest of the European team in the top half of the list.
"I went with this group in this order because I think it illuminates the entire journey," said Bjorn to his choice of players in a personal game.
The new German warship is re-launched
A newer German Navy ship was planned to be launched in 2014 to replace the older ships used in the Cold War, but it will not be until at least next year due to poor systems and increased costs, media reported.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit magazine which quoted a military spokesman.
This ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but later delivery issues affected the fate of this large project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships the Navy ordered in 2007 are coming to replace the Bremen class warships.
It is known that they will include a powered cannon, mounting range and aircraft and decorative missiles and ships as well as secret technologies, such as decommissioned radar, infrared and akostick signals.
Other important components include organizations after a long time - it is possible to send the new ships two years away from home.
However, ongoing delays mean that the high-speed warships â€“ said to allow Germany to target overseas â€“ will already be outdated when they come into service, explained Die Zeit.
The F125 came to prominence last year, when the German Navy refused to launch the ship and take it back to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had returned ships to shipbuilders after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the restoration, but the German press referred to a number of reasons for "essential software and hull defects" that made ships irrelevant if sent to war.
A shortage in the program was important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg will be operated by 120 sailors - just half of the crew on the old Bremen ships.
It also turned out that the ship has an extra weight that amablo reduces her performance and limits the Navy's ability to improve it in the future.
The ship hio of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy compared to similar ships used by the Germans in the Second Great War.
In addition to faulty frameworks, the cost of the entire project - including employee training - is also a major issue.
It reportedly reached 3.1 billion euros (<0x24>3.6 billion) - from the initial cost of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems facing the new ship become of particular importance due to the warning that German naval capacity has dropped.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that Usage is indeed "going to lack ships capable of being sent to war."
The official said that the issue had long been underestimated, because old ships were withdrawn but no alternative ships were offered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be used by the Navy.
The Nationa Trust Survives the secret life of batsman
New regional research in the Uskot Mountains aims to describe how bats are using the environment in hunting their food supplies.
You expect these results will provide new insights into the behavior of these unique flying animals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study of scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will follow the pipistrelles and soprano bats as well as the long eared bat and the Daubenton bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed in key locations near the area to monitor bat's activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct a telephone survey using handheld scanners.
A sound analysis for the expertise of all records will confirm the frequency of the bats and the species doing so.
Environmental mapping and reports will be given to create a comprehensive environmentâ€”a graphical framework for their behaviors.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, expects results will show which habitats are the most important to bats and how they are used by each species of bats.
This explanation will help determine the benefits of environmental management work such as pasture formation and better ways of maintaining forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in both Scotland and England has declined sharply over the last century.
They pose a threat from building work and development that affect nesting and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lights can also lead to hazards, as well as insecticides and some chemical products of building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats are not particularly blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more important than when their eyes arrive it is the point of catching prey.
They use a complex echolocation technique to target insects and obstacles in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining over 270 historic buildings, 38 critical gardens (76,000 hectares) of land across the country, considers the bats very carefully.
It has provided training for ten trained specialists, who occasionally perform surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescue bats.
The organization has even established the first and only known bat reserve in the UK on the property of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten bat species in the UK.
Property manager David Thompson has said the property is the best location for the batsmen.
"Here in the Threave we have a large area for the bat," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all beautiful surroundings.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we are doing here and in other resources will help us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
"He emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of bats before making organizations within the property because it is possible for unconscious destructions can kill up to 400 young bats and bats, and possibly destroy the entire number of bats in the area.
Bats are protected and are illegal to kill, harass or disrupt or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Population Preservation Association, has urged the public to intervene and help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats because many of our species we don't know how many are left."
Ronaldo denied allegations of rape as lawyers plan to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has said the alleged rape against him is "false news," saying that people "want to declare themselves" under his name.
His lawyers have planned to appeal to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese attacker and Juventus have been charged with raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is alleged to have later paid him <0x24>375,000 to be quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking in a live Instagram video for 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, rebuked the reports as "false information."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, "The five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or prize says on camera."
"They want to introduce themselves under my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for naming me, but it's part of the job.
I'm happy and I'm fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the allegations, which they said is "unacceptable reports of suspicion in a private area," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek the payment of "moral damages in accordance with the seriousness of the violations, which may be one of the greatest violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a chub at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported to have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the background, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt after the incident and told him that for "99<0x25>" he is a "good" person who was dropped by "one percent."
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with her, but it was voluntary.
Mayorga also says that she went to report to the police and was photographed of her injuries in hospital, but later accepted outside court compensation because she felt "fear of revenge" and was worried about "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now ready to pay for the ransom because she continues to have a psychic discomfort with the incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the allegations, and this season he moved to Italian champions Juve when he was bought for <0xC2><0xA3>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will regret forever' for losing automakers
UK will 'forever regret' for losing its position as world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a contract it could suspend production time at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," said Mr Clark
Japanese automaker said the effect of border delays if there is no contract after Brexit will result in unemployment.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Auris Toyota and Avensis - produced around 150,000 vehicles last year where 90<0x25> were exported to the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU in March we will see a move to stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have expressed fear of leaving the European Union without agreement on how the territorial trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main issues relate to what the manufacturers say are the risks of distribution in the event that there is no agreement after Brexit.
The Toyota production is implemented on the basis of "proper-time", with equipment arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the European Union to ordered vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be problems at the border that the sector says may cause delays and equipment shortages.
It is impossible for Toyota to wait more one day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus production will be suspended.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "prepared to avoid the investigation at the border."
"We need to have a deal.We want to have a better deal that will allow not only the success at the moment but also to take advantage of the current opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today show.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue to get the distribution that has been successful in the past."
Toyota was unable to say the duration of the production suspension, but over time, it warned that additional costs would reduce factory competition and eventual job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite Alliance in the factory, said his associates are becoming increasingly concerned: "In my experience once these jobs have left they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
The high-profile meeting of Donald Trump and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "retired for another week" with the conflict surrounding the Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh continuing, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is in charge of the role of special adviser David Mueller, who is investigating electoral interference with Russia, the relationship between Trump's deputies and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump is seeking a job as deputy attorney general and thus endangering Mueller's independence, it has sparked rumours of Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing wires to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, with allegedly about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at a United Nations summit in New York, was announced to take place on Thursday.
Trump said "I prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who charged him with sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, resulting in a delay in the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "The date for that has not been set, it may be this week, I can see it causing it to be pushed back for another week if you consider what it is in the high court.
But we will see what will happen and inform the media.
"Other journalists could have objected to the remarks: Sanders has not hosted a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Local Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of information is not due to the bias of the "attractive" television journalists, though he said: "I don't want to disagree with the fact that they attract attention."
He then said that direct communication between Trump and journalists will increase.
"The president makes more <0x51>uestions and Answers sessions than any previous president," he said, adding without mentioning evidence: "We have looked at those figures."
"The press release will continue, Sanders said, but "if the media has the opportunity to directly question the president of the United States, that's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it many times and you've seen us do it more in the last few weeks and that this will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
"Trump responds to repeated questioning when leaving the White House or when participating in open sessions or meetings with foreign leaders.
Meetings and media on their own are rare.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, by giving a speech unorganized and sometimes appearing before the assembled press.
Minister of Health notes to EU staff at Health Organization Uskoti about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to European Union workers working for the Health Organization Uskoti giving thanks for the country and expecting they will be left after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter while remaining six months to the United Kingdom to withdraw from the EU.
The Scottish government is committed to reaching the cost of application for the conditions of settlement for EU citizens working in its public services.
In a letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the course of the summer, talks between the United Kingdom and the EU about withdrawal have continued, towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the British Government also improves its preparations for the impossibility of the solution.
I know this is a very unhappy time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to mention how I appreciate each employee's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and beyond, bring in valuable experience and knowledge that strengthens and improves the work of health care, and helps patients and the community we serve.
The Scots is entirely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christin Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a game they lost 31â€“27 on Saturday against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the brink and just fainted," Reed said.
Staff and medical doctors gave Abercrombie oxygen from the edges before placing him on a stretcher for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV program in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no explanation for the type/ level of pain yet" and the State of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first-class student, ako in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which increased the total number of tackles in the season to 18.
Out-of-state buyers will be paid a high stamp tribute if they buy in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged with high stamp duty buying property in the UK with extra money used to help homeless people under the new Tory scheme
The hio move aims to balance the success of Corbyn's move to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be paid to those who do not pay their tribute to the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to earn up to <0x24>120 million annually - to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be paid a high stamp tribute if they buy property in the UK - and extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May has announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to balance the success that Jeremy Corbyn has achieved in order to attract young voters with a promise to offer affordable housing and target high-income voters.
Increases in stamp duty will be charged to individuals and businesses that do not pay their tribute in the UK, with extra money being used to improve the government's plan to combat the condition of housing for the homeless.
The extra fee - which includes the current stamp tribute, including the high rates set two years ago - on second-degree housing and rental housing - can range from up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the hio's move will give it up to <0x24>120 million annually.
An estimated 13<0x25> of new buildings in London are purchased by non-British residents, leading to a price increase and making it difficult for first-time buyers to purchase their first home.
Many rich parts of the country - especially in the capital - have become "spirit towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending their time more abroad.
The new policy comes a week after Boris Johnson asked for a discount in the stamp tribute to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of setting property prices high by buying real estate and failing to build them and asked Mrs. May to withdraw and tax the house in order to correct the "addiction in the housing sector" of the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of appeals to settlement reform, including tax control would threaten the expulsion "without fault".
He also wants to give councillors more power to build new houses.
Ms. May said: "Last year I wanted to volunteer to revive Britain's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means changing our damaged residential sector.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and start a new life.
However, it can't be fair that it's easy for people who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy houses at the same price as hard-working residents in the UK.
For so many people the dream of home ownership has been so far removed and there is a lot of potential homeless."
Jack Ross: 'The point of my determination is to be the boss of the Scots'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "immediate" is to be the manager of Scotland at some point.'
The Scotsman, 42, greatly enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, now in third place in the First League, three points from above.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this season after helping St Mirren return to the Scottish League the previous season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was able to get a country game for Team B and it got to that," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound show.
"But I grew up watching the Scots in Hampden with my dad as a child and I've always been fascinated with that thing.
However, that opportunity will only come, if I succeed in the management of the club."
"Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he had no fear of following such famous names at such a big club, having rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My performances at the moment will be measured by 'how can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and equipment in this club, it should definitely be in the English Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy job to return, but I'd just like to see myself as successful here if I could get the club back up there."
"Ross has only three years since he started managerial work, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months as an instructor at the Hearts club.
He then helped Alloa from being relegated to third and replacing St Mirren from being relegated to winning the League cup the following season.
And Ross says he feels so much better than he was when playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably the real way," he recalled, of taking charge of Alloa.
"I certainly believed management was better for me, than playing.
It seems weird because I did the right thing, got the income from playing and enjoying the highest levels of conditions.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you should do every week.
I'm still reviewing that in terms of stress and pressure but I feel management is okay.
I always wanted to be in charge and now I'm doing it, I feel better inside me all my adult life."

The best time for obtaining alcohol is 11.30 p.m. Saturday, a study has found
The summer heat has increased drinking in struggling British bars but has added more pressure to restaurants.
Bates experienced a 2.7<0x25> increase in July - but restaurant drinking decreased to 4.8<0x25>, data showed.
Peter Martin, of CGA's business adviser, which included the data, said: "The continued sunshine and Britain's more time-consuming participation in the World Cup means July followed the same model as last June, when bars saw a 2.8<0x25> increase, except that restaurants had an even more impact.
A 1.8<0x25> discount in the restaurant business in June went even further down in July.
Beverage bars did much better while restaurants were discounted.
Restaurant bars were affected by the summer, though not as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out and get a drink.
Controlled bars saw a 6.6 percent increase in sales that month and a three percent drop in food."
"Paul Newman, entertainment and hospitality analyst at RSM said: "These results are continuing in the direction we have seen since the end of April.
The climate and impact of major social events or sports are still the biggest factors affecting sales in the domestic market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chain groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8<0x25> per year will drastically hurt if you take into account the ongoing cost-effective pressures.
The long-term hot season has come at the worst time for food service providers and we'll have to wait if the average temperatures we got August will change things for the better."
"The overall sales growth in bars and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7<0x25> in July, compared to declining brand products.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that are kept secret from their parents
One in five children - some even 11 years old - have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers, research exposes
A survey of 20,000 high school students has shown growth in the pages "Insta fake"
The statement has led to fears that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said that they own a "great" account to show parents
One in five children - some even 11 years old - create fake social media accounts that they keep secrets from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has shown rapid growth in the "Artificial Intelligence" account - a reference to the website to share Instagram.
The story has increased fears that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they create a "great" account to show parents, while they also own other private ones.
A mother who discovered the website of her 13-year-old daughter found a young man urging others to "take me."
The study, Digital Awareness UK and the Great Britain Association of Independent School Teachers (HMC), found 40<0x25> of children aged 11 to 18 had two accounts and half of them agreed to keep accounts privately.
HMC chief executive Mike Buchanan said: "It worries that a lot of young people are being tested in creating online venues that parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletes as an inactive director at the executive annual meeting of the executive board.
Doyle is a Scottish athlete with the most awards and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from his extensive experience at the international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly regarded in the community of Uskoti, England by the world athletic community and we are sure athletics in Uskoti will benefit greatly by engaging him on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I intend to be the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter dash at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta between his total of four Olympic golds and is now a commentator at the BBC, failed to walk after suffering a lack of blood flow.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said it will only be known in time if and to what extent I will be able to recover.
It's been a difficult task to fully recover, to relearn how to walk and today make a relapse!
Thanks for a message of comfort!"
An advertisement for a breast pump comparing a mother to a cow evokes different opinions online
The breast pump company has split comments online using an advert that compares breastfeeding mothers to milked cows.
To mark the launch of what is known as "the world's most silent breast pump wear," user-generated technology company Elvie released a humorous music video advertisement to show the freedom that the new pump gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers play densi in a barn filled with cow food with a song that includes words such as: "Well, I struggle, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't realize these aren't twins my breasts."
The song continues: "Get out, move out, I'm feeding the kids, dictionary out, dictionary out, suck my women."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 viewing times and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reviews from viewers and many say it shows the "fear" of the dairy sector.
"The terrible decision to use a cow to advertise this product.
If we need to conceive and give birth to produce milk, unless their babies are removed immediately after birth," one wrote.
Elvie's breast pump goes very well into breastfeeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: "It haunts mother and child imaginatively.
But yes why don't you use them to advertise the breast pump to the mothers who are left with their children?"
Another person added: "An unconcerned declaration."
Others defended the ad and one woman admitted that she felt the song was "laughter."
I think this is a very strong idea.
I'd get one if I was still breastfeeding.
The milking made me feel like a cow.
The advert is stupid but I understood it.
This is a highly creative product," one wrote.
Another person said: "This is a fun advert that focuses on the depth of the mother who milks milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like "a cow."
"This is not an announcement to praise or condemn the dairy sector."
At the end of the video a group of women show that they have all been playing with pumps on their mandarins.
The campaign concept is based on the knowledge that many women who use pumps say they feel like cows.
Elvie's pump however, is completely silent, has no cables or nanotubes and fits completely into breastfeeding and gives women freedom by moving, holding their babies and even going out while milking.
Ana Balarin, an ECD partner and teacher at Mother said: "The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and inspiring launch.
Given the similarity between describing women and dairy we wanted to put the act of pumping the breast and all its challenges in the care, while showing in a fun and interesting way the sense of freedom that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has hit the headlines.
During Fashion Week in London, a mother of two walked the stage with architect Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Are secretly Transferred to Tent Camp at Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though the number of passers-by border has not changed, because the politics and strict policies offered by the Trump administration have made it difficult to keep children to donors.
Typically, many donors have been unregistered immigrants and have feared risking their ability to remain in the country by continuing to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when the state authorities announced that possible donors and other house adults would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Mathew Albence, a senior officer for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the organization had arrested several people who had asked to fund children on their own.
The agency later confirmed that 70<0x25> of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"Nearly 80<0x25> of people who are donors or family members are here illegally in the country and most of them are criminal aliens.
. So we keep track of those people," Mr. Albence said.
In the process of cutting up children more quickly, the leaders introduced new laws that will require some of them to be submitted to the court within a month of the arrest, rather than 60 days, which was a custom previously, according to residential workers.
Many will be presented via a video conference call, rather than a person's presence, to request their case for a legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who will be considered unfit for help will be quickly returned to their homeland.
The way a child remains in detention for a long time is the more likely he or she is to experience fear and anxiety or discouragement, which can lead to feelings of violence or attempts to escape, according to the staff of the sitcom and reports that have emerged from the system several months ago.
Lawyers said these issues are escalating at major centres such as Tornillo, where signs that a child has a bad state are ignored, due to its size.
They added that moving the children to the tent city without giving enough time to provide them emotionally or interact with friends the last time could add to it being what many are already going through.
Syria tells 'called forces' of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although it has now reached eight years of war in the country.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are in Syria illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be handled accordingly."
"They should leave immediately and unconditionally," he told the meeting.
Moualem maintained that "the war against terrorism was nearly complete" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy war until we have rescued all areas of Syria" from all terrorism groups and "any foreign presence."
"The United Nations has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and mentoring Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
In the case of the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good for them to return and he blamed the "western states" for "spreading false fear" which caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return measures," he said.
"They're putting politics on the human issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no construction assistance for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a bafa reservation in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has blocked attacks by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region, where three million people live.
Moualem however maintained that the agreement had a "clear moment" and expressed hope that a military action will help the militants including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-<0x51>aeda, who will be "completed."
The UN Commissioner Staffan de Mistura hopes to host the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare an election route.
Moualem put the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be controlled "to investigate the passages of the current constitution," and warned against intervention.
Why Trump Will Re-Election Re-Election
to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again unless viewers like progress and change is widely hoped that the removal of power mismanagement and scandals will end his presidency early.
And be of course "The greatest end of the presidency ever!"
Currently, there are no indications of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million, an increase from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" leads in cable television ratings for 3.5 million viewers on the main night of the news.
"These are things that draw people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's drama show "Designated Survivor," about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol's executive offices.
Nell Scovell, former comic writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalls a taxi trip in Boston prior to the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said," because he's always making me laugh," Ms. Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories from Washington may later decide Roe v. Wade's case against Wade, if immigrant families can reunite with the health of the world's economy.
To show up is only a luxury for viewers with the many opportunities they can afford.
However, the issue outweighs Trump's conscious citizen when you find yourself in a sixth watch panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "high-pitched" in the sources of his book "Fear," Jacket of <0xC2><0xA3>15,000 of the designer's skin of Paul Manafort ("a bold outfit," the Washington Post said.
I, never, will ever see Super Mario in the same way again.
"A portion of what he does and makes it look like a real show is that he gives you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and architect of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's show switching characters to scenes every day (starting a confrontation in the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You don't want to miss one session or stop tracking.
When I reached Mr. Fleischs this week, there was an 80 degree sun outside his house on the north side of Kauai, but he had locked himself inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not leave there, not like Brett Kavanaugh approaching to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the fate of the Supreme Court if it is unknown.
"I remember when we were doing all these amazing moments in the past and people were saying," This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleischs told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outer funds overflow into closest election of Parliamentary representatives
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17 districts have experienced financial flooding, due to a renewed lean toward congressional districts that found two current leaders fighting for the same seat.
Pittsburg's newly-formed district has a Democrat Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in the last special election of the spring season.
Lamb is running for the incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is the current leader representing Pennsylvania's former 12th district, which is prevalent with the new 17.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been drawn to suit the Republicans.
Candidates in the new 17s have set up financial competitions in the philanthropic categories of the main parties, the Congressional Committee of the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb was a prominent name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election closely followed March in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts say the Demokrats have a little better chance of winning.
The United States envisioned Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Stopped
Diplomaticists said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and little pressure not to do so from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a good meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners dismissed the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials in the State Department decided to remove the U.S. diplomatic key messages from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama regarding "the latest decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," a spokesman for the department, Heather Nauert, said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only focused on El Salvador, which earned <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in monetary aid and restrictions on visa applications, would have a significant impact on the Central American country and unemployment and high rates of homicide.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American leaders proposed a high-level meeting on safety and economic well-being and followed a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving toward the United States.
But in mid-September, high-ranking leaders declared that they wanted the rally to continue and effectively stop any penalties consideration for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the meeting, scheduled to be held in mid-October, with a sign of the importance the administration has placed at the convention, diplomats said.
And three American diplomats returned anonymously to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a strong new message or penalties from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton refused to provide information on the explanation of the debate by three US leaders, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal talks without revealing identity.
Their views were confirmed by an external critic close to the regime and he also discussed without exposing identity.
A Study of History
The shoe that follows the fall may be a report by special attorney Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, where there is now substantial evidence in the public.
Mr. Mueller also directs his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in attacking our elections.
If Congress changes control, Mr. Trump will find himself facing cases of accountability in the legislature, just as he prepares to go again asking for votes to the electorate and possibly eventually the judges of his associates.
That's a lot of things that's currently just saying kena is possible and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's removal from power is inevitable â€” nor is it possible for leaders like him in Europe.
There are choices that must be made by each side of the Atlantic that will affect the long-running nature of the struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the Western nations refused to support and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to escape the years of the ensuing massacre.
The trend of history revolves around such changes and the stability of the course of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a number of changes at present.
How will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who is controlling the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in critical condition since the newspaper reported that last year, he proposed secretly recording the president and said he is not worth being in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' memory is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is not complete and fair â€” or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, we'll vote in the election of House representatives who won't make Mr. Trump look righteous?
If we fail these measurements, democracy will face the risk of long-term decline.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz by the Nazi government which at one time was using my diplomatic home.
He survived, he emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika sign.
With that as my legacy, how can I miss a positive outlook on our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers has plenty of hope before match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against Austrians, after a good uniform in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Link Graham Dorrans from playing his first match of the season up to a 2â€“2 uniform against Villarreal but believes Rangers could use the result to set up many points.
"It was a good sign for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We went into the game believing we could find something and came back with one score.
Maybe we could get more at the end but, in general, the uniform was probably the same result.
They were probably better in the first half and we went in the second half as better.
Entering on Thursday, is another big night in Europe.
Hopefully, we can get all three points but it'll be a tough game because they got good results in their last game but, with our fans behind us, I'm sure we can push and get good results.
Last year was very difficult, between everything that happened to my injuries and the club changes but there's a good feeling about this place now.
The squad is the same and the players are very happy; your training is the same.
We expect, we can push now, forget the past season and succeed."
Women are sleeping from fear of savings for retirement
Although it was true that the research participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, a few people were talking to their families about this.
Approximately half of the population in a nationwide study said they were talking to their loved ones about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10<0x25> said they talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to care about them, but they don't take steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Insurance business.
This is how one starts.
Talking to your partner and the children: you cannot provide your family with a service if you do not make your wishes well known before time.
Contact your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive services, because those options can be an important factor in determining costs.
Congratulations to your financial advisor: your counselor can also help you find a way to pay the costs.
Your philanthropic options for long-term care may include long-term insurance policy, securities life insurance policy of money value in order to handle these costs or independently of your wealth â€“ the best you have money.
Use your legal documents: Prevent your legal cases.
Get a medical service proxy so that you can select a person you believe in overseeing your medical care and make sure that the professionals comply with your requirements if you cannot communicate.
Also, consider the lawyer's contribution to your finances.
You should choose the person you believe in making financial decisions for you and assuring your expenses are being paid on time.
Don't forget the details: think your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
You have the ability to answer questions about drugs and hemispheres?
Put the comments in the written plan for you to be ready.
"Not only is the money that is involved, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is treatment?
Who's going to handle a dog?
Put that plan right."

Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed by the massive earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, leaders said and the number of disasters are expected to rise.
With communications being cut off, aid officials have not been able to obtain any information from the Donggala administration, the area north of Palu which is close to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake disaster.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the provincial capital of Central Sulawesi, it lies at the end of a narrow slab on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city was marking the 40th anniversary of the tsunami.
Donggala is a prefecture located on the coast of over 300 km (180 mi) northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The provisional government, administrative area under the county, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the economic base of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is particularly common in Morouwali, babala and the Sulawesi coast.
Palu and Donggala have been swept by tsunamis several times over the course of 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Fire Pete and is repeatedly hit by an earthquake.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh Indonesian province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of the dead were from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquake struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island , off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, an island of many inhabitants in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that broke off the south coast, killing around 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra and triggered a 10-metre-long tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regime in Aceh and caused damage and panic as people remembered the destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered at this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son Arrested on Domestic Abuse Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic abuse, blocking a report of domestic abuse and refusing to be arrested, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a girlfriend tried to call the police to report a criminal allegations, she picked up her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Trial Center and on a <0x24>500 non-security bail, reported KTUU.
He arrived at the Court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, certainly" when asked for his pleas, the network reported.

Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people are dead after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication networks were disbanded and the death toll is expected to rise in the future.
The earthquake occurred just outside the central Sulawesi which is located in the northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos revolve around social media showing time of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a coastal festival in the town of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
State prosecutors seek punishment of rare death for New York City terror attack suspect
New York state prosecutors seek the death penalty for Sayfulo Saipov, a suspect of terrorist attacks in New York City that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for state crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly using a Home Depot rental vehicle to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking pedestrians and cyclists into his path in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to a report of intent to seek the death penalty, issued in the Southern District of New York.
All these offences carry the possibility of a death penalty, according to a court document.
Weeks after the attack, a panel of state judges issued a verdict of 22 charges to Saipov which included eight murder charges with the aid of fraud, commonly used by state prosecutors in organized crime cases and charges of violence and traffic damages.
The attacks needed to be "planned and well prepared," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's act as "disgusting, cruel and misleading."
"Sayfullo Habibillaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pavo's
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York implemented capital punishment charges.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was implemented in a state trial in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were punished with death after being found guilty of conspiring to make a blinking for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
The two Rosenberg were executed by death by being placed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
A native of Uzbekistan, Saipov expressed a lack of remorse the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attacks after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to accusations.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has denied 22 criminal charges.
David Patton, one of the country's public defenders representing Saipov, said that they are "broken" by the verdict of the prosecution.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting guilty pleas for life in prison without the possibility of release will only add up to such incidents for all involved," Patton said.
The Sipov prosecutor's team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FIGHT should be put in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to 'promote the army of the people' today during a protest at a Tory rally.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should 'feel warmth' from anti-EU citizens - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that she should be president of talks with the European Union.
Conservative party MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain 'should have been out' by now if Mr. Farage was to become Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that Ms. May faces is the challenge of bringing together her deeply divided side which became apparent when Tory supporters of Stay joined a separate protest against Brexit in the town.
The prime minister is working to implement his plan for the Checkers' agreement amid criticism from Brexit supporters, supporters of the Remaining and the European Union.
His allies insisted that he would go ahead with a move to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the objectionsâ€”and force opponents to the European Union and the Lebanese party to choose between its plan and the 'problems'.
Mr Bone told a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted 'to give up the Chequers plan'.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a partner and given the responsibility of negotiations with Brussels.
â€˜If he had control, we'd already be out now,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit but we need to forget the Checkers plan.'
Expressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: 'We didn't fight in a world war to spare less than others.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain completely untrue.'
'Tory MP who supports Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in protest and told reporters: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Checkers plan is not very popular with the general public, the Opposition cannot vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually go to the streets and help us get elected.
Please leave the Checkers program and start listening to people.'
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: 'The Prime Ministers retain their positions as they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage told the meeting that politicians should be made 'feel warm' if they are about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'This is about the issue of trust between us â€” people â€” and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell 'we can't let you do it.'
In a message to the excited crowd he added: 'I want you to make our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, to feel warm.
'We inspire an army of this country's people that will give us victory in Brexit and which will never rest until we are free, independent, proud Britain.'
At the same time, Supporters stayed on with the march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Many activists showed signs written Tories against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Lebanese MP Mr. Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they experienced in the party program when the meeting opened.
'These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technologies of the UK and the EU to respect the laws of another, by arbitrary limit, for free trade without limits in Ayalandi,' he added.
'Cause it's an empty lie.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans a 'deep look' at the intention of running for president,
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is planning a "deep look at the intentions of running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reported that the Democrats of Massachusetts spoke about his fate during a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against GOP Representative Geoff Diehl, who was chairman of the 2016 Trump Campaign partnership in Massachusetts.
He has been in the midst of rumors that he can face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters using the town hall design since Trump was elected.
The attendees asked him if he planned to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that involves a woman in a high seat."
Man arrested in connection with LSU's Sims shooting murder
Police in Baton Rouge, No., announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the death of the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 5 a.m. ET in a press conference.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the person who appeared in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died from that," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to protect the victim when he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interviewed and admitted to being at the scene of the incident, possession of a weapon and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6-year-old Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games and started in 10 games in the previous season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears World Cup win after team instructions give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from when Valtteri Bottas recovered before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team instructions Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the start, Bottas got a good start and almost completely abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel took the lead first and left Hamilton to follow a tramp on the team's tail, something that was supposed to play a big role.
Mercedes made one round and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton passed the front after a fierce race that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the inside free zone from the impact of the shutdown after doing so twice in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was in seventh position by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for most of the race and held and then passed Kimi Raikkonen to fourth.
He eventually reached his rehabilitation zone in round 14 and failed to accelerate in the remaining eight rounds with Raikkonen taking fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri worked a wonderful whole weekend and showed maturity to let me pass.
The team has done a unique job to take the first and second place," said Hamilton.
That was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday about his insistence that he did not disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly discuss the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead saying that what is going on in the Senate indicated that people were "sexy, bad and false."
"One thing that can happen and the good thing that's been going on a few days ago in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and greedy and bad and lying," he said.
"When you look at offerings and exposes then they say" oh, I didn't. I didn't.
I didn't."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal?
You remember his answer... did you expose the script - "oh, oh, what?
Ah no!
I didn't reveal.
"Well, wait a minute.
Are we we exposed ... No, we didn't reveal you," he added, by imitating the senator.
Feinstein was used for a letter explaining the charges against Kavanaugh and Ford in July and it was disclosed early in September - but Feinstein denied that it came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported
"He asked me to keep it in secret and I kept it in secrecy as he requested."
But his remarks did not seem to be well received by the president, who commented during a Saturday night meeting: "I'll tell you this, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's appointee, who has been charged with sexual abuse offences by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using these claims for their benefit.
"They have decided to take power in any way.
You see loneliness, evil, they don't care who hurts who, who have affected to gain power and control, "Mediaite reported the President saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars ransomed a losing match against the Belfast Giants on Friday in the Elite League by winning the match 5â€“3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an early lead via two touchdowns from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised for the hosts before Dwyer gave the Giants the lead again.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two laps to Lukas Lundvald Nielsen gave them the win.
It was the third game they lost in the season to the team of Adam Keefe, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2â€“1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time they met in a season between the teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 9:35 after getting the ball from Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford gave Beauvillier the ball to tie the second goal four minutes later.
In the first inning, Sullivan equalised for the hosts in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt scored a touchdown that resulted in a Cownie score at 15:16.

Air Traffic Controller Dies While Confirming Hundreds of Flight Navigators Can Avoid Earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after losing his life while ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of people has left safely.
More than 800 people have died and others are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Later tremors continue to occur in the area and many are trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his comrades escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to escape from his position at Mutiara Airport's control tower Sis Al Jufri.
He remained to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the road at the time, was able to take off safely.
He then flew a traffic control tower when he thought it was falling.
He died later in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision was able to save hundreds, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are breaking to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, the leadership fears that the death toll may reach thousands and the country's disaster mitigation agency has said that the reach of the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is very low.
"The number is believed to be still increasing as many bodies were still trapped under the falls as it is a challenge to reach many," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Six-meter-long waves have destroyed Palu which will provide a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring support and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Fresh water is rare.
Small markets have been broken all over."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is working to help the victims but we don't know what it is.
This is already a disaster, but the situation may be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all activities related to exile.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was struck earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Flight crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one person is missing after a plane crash into a lagoon.
An airline that owns a plane that crashed in the Pacific in Micronesia has now said that one person is unavailable, having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely rescued when the plane sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unable to determine when he was one man.
The agency said it is collaborating with local leadership, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The agency did not immediately respond to requests for further details regarding passengers, such as their age or nationality.
The area barges helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
The leaders said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The agency said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the series of events are still unknown.
The agency and the U.S. Navy all said the plane landed in the lagoon just before it reached the route.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane had hit water on the road.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to walk in the water that reached them waist-high through the emergency doors of the aircraft that were sinking.
He said the flight attendants were frightened and shouted and that he received a minor head injury.
U.S. Marines said sailors working to improve the pier closely also helped rescue them by using a breathboat to transport people to land before the plane sank at about 30 m (100 ft)
Data from the Air Traffic Safety Network show 111 people have died in plane crash accidents registered with PNG over the past two decades but none involved with Air Niugini.
The critic shows a record of events on the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution unit finished describing her case on Saturday in a frequency case where a man accused of stabling a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as a professional witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He showed to a panel of judges how he used cell phone records to combine the activities of the 29-year-old defendant, <0x51>uinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the disaster.
Rowlett said he received area data from several cell phones that showed Tellis had Chambers on the evening of his death, contrary to his earlier claim, Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed his cell phone had Chambers' when he said he had his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took a stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said they were in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he "was lying, because my car was Nashville."
"Another unrelated statement is that Tellis said he had known Chambers only two weeks before his death.
Mobile phone records indicate they had known each other for only one week.
Rowlett stated that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the text messages from Chambers and contact details from his phone.
"He completely fired him out of his life," Hale said.
The advocacy is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be sent to a panel of judges later that day.
The High Breed: Hip hop what is it?

High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop was lost away from its political message nature and confronting social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make a revolutionary hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently seen new popularity in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
Home minister New York sues couples for being fired after a "racist" message
A housekeeper from New York accuses a couple of firing her on discrimination grounds after receiving a non-traditional message from a mother complaining that she was "just another black man."
Couples reject being racist and likening the allegations to "scams."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed concerns after discovering that a new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was a black man upon arriving for her first day of work in 2016.
"NO HAPPY ON THE GOOD MUSIC," wrote Ms. Plasco -Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After discovering his mistakes, a "feeling" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that their outgoing minister, of African-American descent, had done a bad job and that he was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one working day and then returned to Uber's home.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation in connection with the dismissal and wants a ransom of <0x24>350 a day for the sixth month, for living and working, though without a contract.
"I want to show you, look, you're not fit to do acts like that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's biased."
The couple have denied the allegations of being racist, saying that stopping Maurice the job was the one that developed the right action, fearing that they could no longer believe him after he misjudged her.
"'My wife had sent her a message she didn't intend'".
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But can you put your children in the hands of someone you've wronged, even if it's wrong?
Your baby?
Say the truth."
Comparing the charges to "a fraud," Plasco said it was only two months after his wife had given birth to a child and he was "in very difficult circumstances."
"Will you go sue such a man?
That's not a good thing to do," the banker said.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, a public opinion court has denounced the couple on social media, and attacked their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not prefer a talking bear, a new letter shows
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born some time after this book was accepted, said in connection with the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone reading for the first time before publication.
It's very exciting to know about Paddington's great achievements."
Saying his father, who worked as a camera waiter at the BBC before getting the urge to write a children's book from a small bear toy, would not feel bad for his work being rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "happy and sad" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, who he describes as "a very important member of our family," he added that his father greatly enjoyed his success.
"He was a man with few words and he wasn't proud," he said.
"But because Paddington was so important to him, it's like having a successful child: you're proud even though it's not your actions.
I think he saw Paddington's success in such a way.
Although it was his architecture and his ideas, he was always praising Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to hang out on the phone.
After discovering that her daughter had been interred at Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"And he was repeatedly calling and saying that the situation was very bad and he was not expected to live," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad to tell me he'd die within the next two minutes and I had to hang out goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi , I love you so much, my child.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given him so that his spirit could continue beating were slowly depleting in his system.
He had died a while before and this was just his system to stop working.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to give myself my heart.
"Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with the rest of the passengers â€“ not knowing what she was going through.
"No one knew, he said.
"I had bowed my head and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was when I was on the plane when I felt so sorry for Nad.
That needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved him."
Women mourn card holders to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones by suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on the Welsh bridge with strong messages and phone numbers that people can call.
His son Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began suffering from concussion and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel how I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a very optimistic cook and an infectious smile.
"Everybody knew her with her smile.
Everybody said his smile pleased everyone."
However, he quit before he died, because he was "a dark place."
In 2014, the brother of Tyler, who was 11 years old, was the first to find his brother after committing suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I am always concerned that this will affect others."
Mrs. Davis created a card, "to let people know that there are people out there who you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost her 15-year-old lover Mark, not long after her mother's death.
She didn't say that she feels bad or bothered by ideas," she said.
"Several days before Christmas we discovered a change in his attitude.
He was at the bottom of Christmas Day - when the kids were opening their gifts he didn't want to look at them or communicate."
He said his death led to their being stolen, but they should have struggled to survive: "It puts a hole in the family.
It depresses us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's fate wavers as the FBI begins investigating
"I thought, if we could get something like what he asked for â€” a time-limited inquiry, a maximum of size â€” maybe we could bring a little unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling down" due to the futuristic controversy.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to time.
Representative elections are only taking place five weeks from now, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans fail too much, then they will be very weak in their efforts to keep the person they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling the Senators, convincing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Mr.Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has released its report?
There will be voting in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are working.
It is still unclear if Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the uniform and prove him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee numbers 'down' under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawyer said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea's coalition ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the highest controls on the border between North Korea and China and the high rates of fines imposed on trafficking businesses were the main reasons.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
Most of the refugees from the North are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many are fleeing through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Area with many Armed Forces (almajor DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often returns them forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South - who are in reality still at war - have changed dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on talks to disarm the nuclear disarmament that had stopped.
The incident came after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on broader terms to work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. embargo on lack of progress since then.
"Without any faith in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under that circumstances, there is no way we will remove nuclear weapons as a first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi refers to Brett Kavanaugh as "unself-controlled," and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has said Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh is a "self-determined" man and said he has so much emotion that he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I thought that if it were the woman he ever did that way, they would say 'he can't control himself,'" Pelosi said of his response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh completely denied allegations that he abused Dr Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
At the time of his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and running out of breath talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also publicly denounced Democrats on the committee, citing accusations against him as being "disgusting and scheduled to ruin his reputation" organized by outraged Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved to be incompetent to serve in the Supreme Court, because he indicated that he discriminates against the Democrats.
"I think he withdraws for those words and how he denounced the Clinton family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi did not object when asked if he would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if confirmed and should the Democrats become a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this - if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is right now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Court of Appeals Circuit.
Pelosi added that whether a Demokrat was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Fair Service Act or Roe's case against Wade, because he is said to be a conservative judge.
In his testimony charges, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he could change some Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for an angry, biased man to go to court and expect us to say, 'that's not wonderful,'" said Pelosi.
And Women Should Use It.
It's a good reassurance of the bitterst, the months and years of the most rage and he can't get rid of it without crying.
"We're crying when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's normal, do you?"
She continued,"I was greatly helped by a woman who was active somewhere, who also said she was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she got upset and started crying, she could tell someone she's talking to,"You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
Then he went on to explain to me.
And I thought it was a good idea."
"Tears are allowed as a way to get rid of rage because they are essentially incomprehensible.
One of my recollections from my early career, is an office full of men, where I immediately found myself crying in an impractical rage, caught up in the back of the neck by a big superwoman who I was always a little afraid of - who pulled me into the stairs.
"Don't let them see that you're crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy because you're with you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat senator from Colorado, had worked alongside Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found to have an affair outside of marriage aboard a boat known as Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Ms. Schroeder, he was very distraught and saw no reason not to be able to bid for the presidency.
"It wasn't a decision you did well," he told me while laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed is one more.
Somebody referred to this as the famous "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign's time had grown so far gone, he was back in the fedh fundraiser and thus vowed that he would not enter the race unless he raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a war he was losing.
He found that some of his followers who donated <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 to men would give him only <0xC2><0xA3>250.
"Do they think that pigeons get a discount?" he wondered.
At the time of his speech announcing that he could not launch an official campaign, he was filled with feelings of gratitude for the people who helped him, confused by the system that made it very difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates and anger from gender discrimination - until he ran out of breath.
"You'd think that I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the media treated the incident.
"You'd think the Kleenex company were my business sponsors.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my grave?
"He cried?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can benefit Beijing
The early voices in the trade war between the United States and China were very troubling and although the war will not end soon, the differences between countries may be beneficial to Beijing for a long time, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year for charging tribute to important Chinese sales including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most impacted diversity began this week with a new tribute affecting <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, charging half of all imports to the United States from China.
Beijing has consistently retaliated, recently imposed a five to ten percent tax on US<0x24>60 billion of goods.
China has promised to scale the US action, and the second-largest country of the economy doesn't seem to give up at any time recently.
To make Washington change the move means you have to accept the terms, but publicly accepting US pressure will be a big shame to <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game well, the disadvantages of trade wars against the United States can help China for a long time by reducing dependence between the two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create an environment that can begin a shift in the economy in any country of its own and more dangerous than others have previously thought," said Abigail Grace, a research partner who is considering Asia at the new U.S. Security Advice Center.
Syria 'ready' in return for refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria has said it is ready for a voluntary return to refugees and is asking for help to rebuild a country damaged by a long war over seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is stabilizing.
"Today the situation is more stable and safe from the advances made in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate terrorist-damaged areas to restore regularity.
All conditions now exist for the voluntary return of refugees to the country where they were forced to flee due to terrorism and economic measures that affected their daily lives and careers.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government will welcome help in rebuilding a devastated country.
But he insisted that they do not want assistance on terms or assistance from countries that funded the terrorism.
Europe wins the Ryder Paris Cup
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the United States team by a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at the Le Golf National stadium outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in continental Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the crown when Danish team captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time throughout the tournament, hit his first ball in the water on the 16th hole of 3 holes, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian player Molinari played well in all his shifts and became a 1 in 4 to 5-0-0 player since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 and 4 by a player listed at the bottom of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player listed first place in the world, Dustin Johnson, was defeated 2nd and 1st by Ian Poulter of England who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
A player in eight Ryder cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful European player in the competition with 25.5 points in his games.
"It's not normal for me to cry but today I'm stuffed.
It's been a challenging year.
Thanks to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm happy to win the cup again.
The most important thing is the team and I'm glad I was able to help," said Garcia who was ecstatic after the European championship.
He transfers roles to fellow citizen John Ram who defeated American Tiger Woods 2 stars and 1 in a one-man game on Sunday.
"I feel weird pride, defeating Tiger Woods, I was watching him as a junior," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches to France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising figure from one of the highest level players ever, having won 14 titles and being only the second to do so after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team overwhelmed the weekend to keep the ball part of the grass except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the highest level game in all competitions.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after the bottom game of his squad, "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
There were times this morning when we gave them a lot of challenges to the European team.
We fought.
A lot of respect for Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll organize again, I'll work with our PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go ahead.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to give a compliment.
They controlled us."
