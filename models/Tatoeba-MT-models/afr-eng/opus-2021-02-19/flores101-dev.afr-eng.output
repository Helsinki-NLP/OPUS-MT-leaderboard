Stars give off light and heat because of the energy that hedrogen combines (or unites) atoms to form heavier elements.
Scientists work to create a reactor that generates energy in the same way.
Nevertheless, it has become ‘ a very difficult problem to resolve and will take many years before we see useful fusie reactors built.
The steel needle floats on top of the water because of the surface tension.
Surface tension occurs because the water molecules on the surface of the water are more strongly drawn to one another than are drawn to the air molecules above them.
The water molecules make ‘ an invisible skin on the water level that drives objects like a needle on the surface.
A lem of a modern ice skated shoe has a double ridge with a holronde between-in. The two borders allow for a better grip on the ice, even when it is tilted.
Because the bottom of the blade has a curve, such as the blade from one end to the other, the edge of the ice gets in contact with the blade also curves.
This allows the skater to turn around. If the skate can reach right, turn the skate right, if the skates can reach left, turn the skater to the left.
To return to their former energy level, they need to get rid of the extra energy they have gained from the light.
They do this by giving off ‘ a small part of light,' ‘ called a 'photon'.'
Scientists call this process a simulated waste of radiation because the atoms are stimulated by the bright light, which produces the release of a photon of light, and light is a form of radiation.
The next picture shows the atoms that produce protons, of course, protons in real life are much smaller than in the picture.
Photos are even smaller than those that make up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of use, the phlament in the bulb finally burns out, and the bulb no longer works.
The light bulb must then be replaced, and caution is needed when replacing the light bulb.
First, the switch must be turned off for the armature or disconnect the cable.
This is because if you touch the interior of the stopper or the metal base of the light bulb while it is still partially in the stopper, electricity that flows in the stopper where the metal portion of the bulb flows can give you ‘ a severe electric shock.

The triseratops ’ teeth would enable them to crush not only leaves but also very rough branches and roots.
Some scientists think Triseratops ate bread trees, which were ‘ a type of plant common during the Chet period.
These plants resemble a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, spiny leaves.
The Trikeratops could have used its strong beak to strip off the leaves before feeding the stump.
Other scientists argue that these plants are highly toxic, so it is unlikely that any dinosaur has eaten them, even if animals such as the sloth and other animals like the parrot (‘n descendant of the dinosaurs) can today eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
If you were to stand on the surface of Io, Io’s gravity would work on me, you would weigh less than you weigh on Earth.
A person weighing about 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh 36 pounds (16kg) on Io, thus reducing the force of gravity.
The Sun does not have ‘ a crust like the earth on which you can stand, the whole Sun consists of gases, fire, and plasma.

Nevertheless, very few Royal Navy ships were stationed near the most likely invasion routes, as the advisers feared they would be sunk by a German air raid.
Let's start with an explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was mainly the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
They had ‘ a weaker army and a weaker fleet, although they built four new ships just before the war began.
To capture these countries, Italy’s main aim would require its launch platform for troops, allowing troops to sail across the Middleland Sea and invade Africa.

Interactive design requires components to connect but may also make sense as a ‘ separate entity.
The disadvantages of zomlens are that the complexity of the focus and number of lens elements required to obtain a series of focal lengths are far greater than for primate lenses.
This begins to become less of a problem, since lens manufacturers gain higher standards in lens production.
This allowed focus lenses to make photos of quality comparable to lenses from fixed focal length.
Other drawbacks are that the maximum diaphragm (the speed) of the lens is normally lower.
This makes the cheap zom lenses difficult to use in low-lighting conditions without a ‘flash'.
One of the most common problems when a movie is converted to DVD format is the "overscan".
Most televisions are designed to satisfy the general public.
For that reason, all you see on TV cut the sides, top, bottom, and sides.

When ‘ a low tide opened a wide gap along the Mist River, along the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the wire with a short stone wall on the north near the water’s ridge on ‘ a small beach.
Gridley of Stark put a game about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one shoot until the regular people passed by.
The U.S. plan was primarily supported to launch coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder would launch an distractions attack against the British garrison in Bornsandtown to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing would take 700 men across the river at Tranton Ferry, take possession of the bridge over the Assunink Spron, and thwart any enemy troops ’ escape.
