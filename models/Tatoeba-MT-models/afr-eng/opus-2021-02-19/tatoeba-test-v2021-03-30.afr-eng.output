Can you read my letter and correct the mistakes, if there are.
My conscience bothers me.
Much houses were washed away with the flood.
Why should I care about them?

I think I might be out of a job.
I told Tom I'd be soon.
My son still believes in Santa Claus.
I hate driving.
Sami must wait a minute.
Are they friends?
Tom knows everything about them.
It is dangerous to go into that area on your own.
Sami failed to notice that.
Do you wear gloves?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know my father, do you?
I'm back now with refreshments.
That's why I'm here.
He is my neighbor.
Tom thought it was unfair.
The hotel looked out on the lake.
Tom’s hands were cold.
She is in state to read.
It seems that he knows the secret.
Do you have a cell phone?

Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
You're too late.
What we know about health has taught us through the study of disease.
Tom sits on window reading a book.
We're not going to be here to 2:30.

Tom will be late.
I dare you bridge that revier.
I bought only a new pair of shoes.
We want it back.
The game starts tomorrow.
They can conquer their fear.
This can't be a real diamond.
Tom moved away.
Was Tom there?

This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my umbrella.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom is no longer going to get help from Mary.
I am saving so that I can go to Australia.
I know everything about her.
I am to fall in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
No matter what he says, do not trust him.
You should have visited Kyoto.
I got up when it was still dark.
Find out everything you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God did not exist, we would have to think of him.
Can you help me with this help?
We met in 2008. A year later, we got married.
She's not here.
He asked Mother.
Late in autumn, when the weather was rough, windy, and wet and the cold could penetrate the thickest garment, especially at sea, a poor boat with only two men sailed into the sea.

Quiet!
It's my house now.
The Bird flies.
He arrived 30 minutes late.

Whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.
I wish you had said that before.
I love my mother.
Tom would not object.
I'm much bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I'm your father.
You'll pay for it.
I have a place to keep looking.
Tom has a lot on his plate.
Do you prefer red or white wine?
This is the following!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We forgot her clean.
Japan is full of beautiful cities, for example Kyoto and Nara.
I'll make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat what you want.
It's really nice!
The river that flows through Parrys is called the Seine.
I'm glad you finally came back.
