Members of Welsh Assembly worry they're going to look like stupid ones.
There is concentration nation among some meeting members on the proposal that they change title of AM 'e to MWP'e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from all over the political spectrum fear that it can provoke a ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party says his group is concerned because it's with twp and Pwp rhyme."
To readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means dumb and pwp, excrement.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "invasively" about the name change, but noticed that it was a short speech leap from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of sot or fool.
In this context the Welsh letter w is expressed like the Yorkshire-English Pronunciation of the letter you.
The Assembly Commission, which currently designed legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on any descriptions of what is called Assembly members will, of course, be a case for the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales 2017 empowered the Welsh meeting to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received ample support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As to the AM's title, the Commission Welsh Parliament Members of WMP's preferred, but the MWP option received the most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM's apparently representing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus may be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who within weeks must present a legal recommendation on the changes.
The legislation on reforms will also include other changes to the meeting’s work, including rules on disqualification of AM's and the design of the committee system.
AM'e will get the last say in the question of what to call them when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians agree in referendum about change in country’s name
Selectors are going to vote on Sunday if their country's name must be changed to the "Rebate of Northern-Masedonia".
The popular consent was arranged in an effort to resolve a decades - long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
For some time Athens has insisted that the name of his neighbor in the north represent a claim on his territory and has repeatedly objected to his applications for membership in EU and NASO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the national destination on the name change, said that he would ignore the mood.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue, however, that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martins get quiet because churches are struggling in Harlem.
"Hythically, say the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"None of the two is there today."
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize in other ways these days," he said.
"Founds are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people go regularly."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money out of asset sales won't last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they're back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by condominium apartment buildings full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining havens.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," said he, "and will therefore bring even closer even the day which these churches completely close, because most of the people who move into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Comky in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the building title.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Honor. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to appoint or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the kailjon.
David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the kailjon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the kailjon in July called it something else: "A culture treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first kailjon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger kailjon at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says that Saint Martin's didn't replace him.
What's played off at Saint Martins for the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the congregation's control body, consisting of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese would "go to try to pass the cost" to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complain of a lack of transparency from the diocese's side.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster diving in California
A shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy on Saturday and injured him when he dived for lobsters on the first day of the lobster season in California, say officials.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encintas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends on Saturday morning for half an hour when he heard the boy crying for help and then rowed up with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought it was only the thrill of a first lobster catch, but then he realized." he called, 'I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His whole key bone was torn open,' Hammel saw as he came out of the boy.
"I've called that everyone out of the water should come: 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel to.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
The shark species is not known to account for the attack.
At a media counseling session, Larry Giles said that a shark had been noticed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries from the upper part of his upper body.
Officials have closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsburys plan extension to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's say Boots, Superdrum and Debenhams are fighting with department stores-like beauty passages manned by specialist assistants.
As part of a great expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and houseware fall back, the larger beauty passages in 11 shops across the country will be tested and if it has been a success next year to more stores.
The investment in beauty occurs while supermarkets look for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and houseware.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will for the first time include such brand names as Revlon, Esssie, Twezerman, and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing sequences of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also launchs its Boutique Vrimering Range again, so that the majority of products are fighting-friend - something that all more younger buyers insist on.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop concessions, will test out sessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first week in Croydon opening in South Senden and a second who will open up in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and moving to smaller amounts of food bought daily at local convenience shops mean that supermarkets must do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said that stores are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight with more services and non-food products against discount shops Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's put Argos purchase points in hundreds of stores and also released a number of Habitat sale points since it bought both these chains two years ago, which, according to their grocery sales, had strengthened and made the purchase more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to remake its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint enterprise with Boots in the early 2000, but the relationship ended after an argument about how profits should be divided from the pharmacies within his shops.
The new strategy comes after three years ago Sainsbury's 281 store sold pharmacy business for £125m to Celesteio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin - care products, including La Roche-mailay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty passages to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be on hand to offer advice.
Our range of trade names is designed to meet every need, and the tempting environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a compelling beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 's Raged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones ran away 's raged' after TV-aver Holly Willoughby took her out of a £11 million agreement with his lifestyle-mark business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their housewear-and-untitance trade name, Truly, not.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The This Morning host, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby angrily left Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones by withdrawing their lucrative lifestyle business--to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was angry when TV's golden girl, Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities--which are worth as much as £1.5 million--meaning that she can no longer spend enough time on their housewear-and-convenial trade name, Truly.
The business was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled, according to inaugurateds Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortuiin.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instogram that she was leaving Truly, Jones climbed a jet and traded Britain for one of his vacation houses.
A Source says: "Truly was Holly's greatest priority at far.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her through the coming few decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely stunned all concerned.
No one could believe Tuesday what was happening, it was so close to the introduction.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning host, one of Britain’s stars that pours the most money in, the firm can chase millions out of the bag because of the huge investment in products extending from pillows and candles to dress and home, and the possibility of his introduction encounter even more delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones for ten years and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby prepared Truly with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as chairman in March.
The couples vacation together and Jones own a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV-produce firm.
Willoughby is going to become a brand-ambasssa door for M noticed and will replace Ant McPartlin as offerer of ITV'm a Celebrity.
A Source near Jones said last night, "We won't give any comment on his business business."
Loud words 'and close we fall in love'
He mocked criticism of what he was going to get from the news media because he made a remark that some would consider "unpresident" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
said Trump in his kamma news reader.
"I have given up nothing."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of NorthCorea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament burned up.
NorthCore’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said Saturday, more than three months after the June Assembly of leaders in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding reaction" of the U.S. on North Korea’s early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noticed, the U.S. continues with sanctions designed to keep up the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic overtones in his convention talk.
"We are progressing wonderfully with NorthCore," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim produced positive results, ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and causing the rest of American soldiers to be brought back home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presiding, but instead of 10,000 people out there who are trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have had nearly 200 people just standing there," said Trump as he pointed to the crowd right before him.
Wet wave and quake in Indonesia devastated island, killed hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombokard division, for example, foreign nongovernmental organizations were said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population have been displaced, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catimizing international help.
"In many cases they were sadly clear that they didn't ask for international help, which made it a little difficult," said me. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children are putting a team together to travel to Palu, it is not sure that foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials add the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given the earth tremor that Indonesia continues to endure, the country remains sadly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warninges in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning of strength.
Traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is at best challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's paint exchanged infrastructure a central point of his election campaign and published financially on roads and railways.
However, Juko’s administration is challenged by funding shortages as he faces reelection next year.
Mr. Joko also faced the pressure of sloating sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim primation accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of ontheem, such as Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, arrows, and bows, and other primitive weapons fought on the street.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge kicks good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from an premierliga loss against Chelsea for a purpose in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqri told Sturridge when he was some 30 years inland from the Chelsea target and his team was 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before kicking far to the goal mark.
The attempt had sailed high over the frame as it had glided at the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball roared over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just to try to get into that position, to come on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create for myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and typed once and didn't think too much about it and just kick."
At half a time Culta was 1-0 before the Belgian star Eden Hazard recorded a purpose in the 25th minute.
The Blues ’ goal kicker had replayed in that play-space with a rear kick into Mateo Kovacic before congealing near the middle field and fitting into the Liverpool hero.
Kovacic quickly received and cited in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward kick, he then led himself into the frame for Hazard.
Hzard passed the defense and ended with a left foot-top past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the far target net.
Liverpool contends with Napoli on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group stage of the Champions Legue at Staio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in UEFA Europe Legue.
Death has risen to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, said the country’s disaster agency early on Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped under the debris of buildings that struck the quake on Friday against a range of 7.5, had thrown in, and caused waves up to 20 feet, said the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.

Parliament’s village of Cromwell becomes the latest rewriteer of ‘ history’s controversy ’
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Talibanlike destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "solence" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about removing villages that the form of Oliver Crromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The image storm of the English civil wars was not ordered by Cromwell nor carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycrovt’s magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th - century opinion and part of the representation of a figure many believe to be still anniversaryable.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate depiction is the subject of continued historical debate.
That the conflict of the mid 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Murdervark Versrew Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest Jachina.
The man, who was only identified by his of, "Yuan", was found dead with a torn artery with blood covered near a cage at the market in Liupanshiu in Guizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A Pig farmer prepared to inject pigs with vaccines into Xining Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
It was reported that on Wednesday he traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring pig cage.
He said there was a large male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a Forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-ond pig had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and torn," said the cousin, who was called on his side, "Wu", quoted the Guiyaang Evening News.
Security camera footing showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that the man killed does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A Mark manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are said to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although raar, cases of pigs attacking people have been reported before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier a 650 pounds-ferk had pinned a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife had frightened the animal.
After a Mount Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster".
"They're just playful.
They're picks, very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,' he said.
Res of Orkan Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to southwestern VS.
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it passes over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flood rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern VS over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 m.p.u., a Category 1-orkan, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough across the Pacific Ocean begins to take shape and move eastward to the west coast of the US. As Rosa begins on Monday to approach the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will drive heavy tropical humidity north - truths the southwestern VS.
Rosa will bring Monday rain from up to 10 inches into parts of Mexico.
Then tropical moisture will bring widespread rainfall to the southwest in response to the approaching trough over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous instant influences, waste flow, and possibly desert land spills.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause space rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
So much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
Moral influences may be in rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be most unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep - seated raging rivers to get affected, and thunderstorms will bring severe local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of southern California.
Rainfall totals of more than half an inch are possible, causing slight waste flow and smooth driving courses.
This will be the region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical showers will start to approach Arizona on Sunday and early Monday before the rains become more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread Tuesday to the Four Corners and will last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations throughout the US as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain quite hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central US is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, lingering summer warm weather will try to rise and expand.
It is expected that large sections of central and eastern VS will start hot October, with widespread 80s of the Southern Low Plains to parts of the northeastern.
New York City can reach 80 degrees Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long - term climate forecast indicates a higher chance at above average temperatures for the eastern VS for the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the stirring testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who charged him with a sexual assault that reportedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political dead-point continued, with broadcasters interrupted regular programs for Friday's up-the-nipper-winning: an agreement established by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to perform a week - long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Legal Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh felt her in drunkenness and tried to pull her clothes out of a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he's 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that on Friday more than 20.4 million people looked at it, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Chanel, and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other networks it showed, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who watch in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience the size of one for a crucial football game or the Academy Adwards.
Fox News Channel, whose opposing hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was all the networks in front of an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day - long trial, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest continued high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS-F where protesters shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to a Legal Committee on Friday morning.
He had been standing down for a few minutes with beaten eyes, while CNN was alive graphic how he was being spoken against.
"I stand right here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and went before the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say at the committee trial.
The cable and broadcasting networks all covered living hours later when the Legal Committee would vote around Kavanaugh's name to the full Senate for a voice.
But Flake said that he would do so only with the understanding that the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate for the following week, such as the Democrat minority has requested.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Demokrat-senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several synators afterward, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the voices to approve of Kavanaugh without the inquiry.
President Trump introduced an FBI investigation into accusations against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of ‘ politics game' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "police play" with Britain's future and subversion to national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May arrives on September 29, 2018 for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview next to one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former minister of foreign affairs Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so - called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal was that Britain and the EU should compete each other's fareable "very ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second-graduate murder, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the struggle.
Police found the glasses back on the scene and said that they had found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS-based WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he had admitted to killing Way.
His bail was fixed on $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The judicial autopsy office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued Friday a preliminary report saying that the cause of death was a rifle shot wound on the head in the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's free - task force, the government police's crime laboratory, Southern University Police and area citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU-atletic director Joe Alleva thanks territorial law application for his "riservation and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six forecaster grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 reinsproge per game.
On Friday morning, LSU-basketball trainer Will Wade said the team hit in"plash" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," said Wayde.
Volcano spits as on Mexico City
As from the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and registered 183 emissions from gas and ash.
The center monitored multiple chants and tremors.
Images on social media showed how thin layers of gas covered car - wind screens in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists marked an increase in activity at the volcano, which sat 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 central mexiko in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalonianparatists before commemoration of independence voice
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined counterattacks to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polaristing voice for sedition.
A group of hooded pro-separatists held back by rioting police tossed them with eggs and threw powdered paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually teem with tourists.
A steamery also broke out later in the day, and the police had to use their clubs to control the fighting.
Over several hours pro-independence groups on one tone "No Forget, No Forgiveness" sang in confrontation with the unionists' cry of "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries suffered in the processions, reported the local press.
The tension still runs high in the independenceist region a year after the referendum of October 1 was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatis-Katalane.
Selectors voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those who bore largely the voice.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried in violent collisions to prevent the polling at the pollies across the region.
Pro-onfhanciness groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent a protest in support of the national police.
The protest continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatists approach with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote but now we stuck,' he said.
Despite a vital but narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties these years struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their best - known leaders either in self - imposed exile or in detention for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year - old megnikus who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalonian leaders in trial support since late last year, announced that he was going to stand in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested from home after car

A crossbow may also have been shot at the car at a time.
Menga dot gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s First Purpose for Livingston guarantees victory
Promotioned Livigston amazed Rangers to transfer Steven Gerard to his second defeat in 18 contests as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga’s goal was evidence of the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved with Hibernian to second.
Gerard's team stayed this season in the premiery without a break and came to face the forerunners Heartt, who were before their eight points.
First, Rangers are Thursday host for Rapid Vienna in the Europe League.
Meanwhile, Livingston expands their unconquered runs in the divisie to six games, with chief trainer Holt who has still not experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is playing chances against bot visitors
Holt's team must have preceded them long before they made a point, with their horror which Rangers brought all sorts of troubles.
SR had broken through, but had stepped in front of the goal, then AL could play only wide after approaching and meet CH’s head holding across the goal.
The hosts were content to have Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors with death pins.
And thus came the decisive goal.
Rangers gave a free kick, and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson giving Menga the chance to kick and draw from the center of the frame a purpose.
By that time, Rangers had dominated but could not get through the home defense, and purpose keeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos had forced a blow from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers-intag Allan McGregor, and Lithgow typed extensively to escape still open game from Livingston.
Cross crossings repeatedly reached the frame of Livingston and repeatedly stopped, while two criminalist – after Halket’s challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one of handball – was turned away.
‘Fenomenal' of Livingston – parsing
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Laon at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and results for Livingston.
Up to the last man, they were excellent; they still exceed expectations on this upward track.
Their game style and manship have been almost unchanged since their return to first class, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his magnificent defense arrangement as Menga Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on their toes throughout.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they at times under Gerard could not uphold those standards.
Their final ball had been missing, and only once could they get through the home team, which is somewhat of a wake call for Rangers, which they found in middle vision.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29,) there were smiles and blue sky when leaders from Turkey and Germany met breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, who had to restore relationships between NATO leagues.
They had a fall over issues involving human rights, press freedom, and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
To prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from meeting before the mosque, the police quoted security reasons, but many supporters arrived afterward to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of their Curdies – also made their voices thick and both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The warring demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor greeted by some German Turks as hero and by others as autocrat.
Deptford road accident: Bicyclinger dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving a car.
The impact took place about 10:15 BST near the settlement of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in southeastern the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The crash comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-step in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials work on identifying the man and informing his close family members.
Road bans and bus bypasss were suggested in place and motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards in riot injured
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high security prison, said the prison office.
Oproer started on Sunday about 09:30 BST and is still going on at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialis "Tornado rangers" were called in to handle the riot, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Special trained prison personnel are deployed to pay attention to an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six personnel were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay longer behind bars."
HMP Long Martin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June it was reported that the chief warden of the prison had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year rioting officials were called in to pay attention to serious disorder in which staff with billiard balls were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa Dreig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitze Floods (Drying Areas Draw May Benefit)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure hit Arizona, but it's exactly what might happen early next week if Orkan Rosa's remaining energy moved across the southwestern desert and brought instant risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued instant floods for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and by Monday will bring near with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noticed in a twit that since 1950 only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Organenter models predict 2 to 4 inches [2 to 4 cm] of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the American Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Come, will likely get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly as many as 4 inches.
For those out of instant risk, Rosa’s rain will probably be a blessing, since the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the SouthWest is experiencing drought.
According to the VS Drying Monitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extremed drought, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, Orkan Rosa’s road leads to approaching land across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles an hour [85 km / hr], is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, so her strength decreases.
Thus, Monday is expected to reach the country at tropical peak in Mexico at midday or evening.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy, with a significant flood risk.
"Renval totals from 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," said weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the Arizona border Tuesday in the early hours of the morning as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah at late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the VS SouthWest," said the National Orkan Center.
It is expected that this rain can cause life - threatening instant influences and debris currents in deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsom Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempting to murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds were found in Summerset.
The injured teenage boy was found on Saturday at about four o'clock BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, said Avon and Summert Police.
Officials appealed to anyone who might have any cell - phone imaging material of what had happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'gely went under the malice, the rage' of the Democratic Party.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "faired under the malice, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before Congress on Thursday and fervently and emotionally denied a claim of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her claim during the trial.
The President said on Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most capable legal spirits of our time, ajuris with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd West Virginia supporters.
The president alluded to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid - term election.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I don't stand, but actually I stand," he said.
That's why I fight all over for these candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mist to "oppose and hinder."
The first important procedure voice on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, said a senior GOP leadership assistant to CNN.
Hundreds die from Indonesian quakes, tsunami, with figures still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach on Friday in the city of Palu for a feast on the beach when waves of up to 20 feet (18 m) broke high at sunset on the beach, washed many away after their death, and destroyed all that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 range of earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster - relief agency BNPB during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had passed over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air pictures released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges that have been distorted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, aftershocks shook the coastal city.
A series of earthquakes has been felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s agency for evaluations and application of technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s huge tremor was about 200 times the force of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sat at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have made the size of the tsunami worse, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the emergency and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 miles (190 km) north of Palu, an area called Donggala closer to the earthquake hair.
Communication "was completely stunted with no information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people who live there, said the Red Cross in a declaration, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It is already a disaster, but it may get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not telling that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had come at the time, the warning had been issued.
In amateur sculptured on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting in the oncoming tsunami at the people down the street.
Within minutes a wall of water hits the beach and blighted buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to explain the image material authenticly.
The quake and tsunami caused great power failures that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but artisans still need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will stay shut until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit Sunday evacuation centers in Palu.
Indonesia tunami mortality rates rise above 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision’s staff of Dongala arrived safely in Palu City, where employees lurked in deck shelters set up in their office courtyard, they passed through scenes of devastation, said Dr. Doseba.
They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed,' he said.
It's very bad.
Even as assistance groups begin the horrible task of triggering the disaster relief project, some people complained that foreign aid workers were being prevented with much experience from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, only after the area of the disaster has been declared national disaster could funds, supplies, and personnel from overseas get under way.
This has not yet happened.
"This is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aubia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "OK, it's a national disaster," we can open it for international assistance, but it's not yet a status."
With the arrival of the second evening on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
Sunday rescuers had saved a woman for two days under rubble with her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandon, coach of the Indonesian national trap - gliders, set up two of the missing parachutists for the Asian Games that had ended in Indonesia.
More of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandiai, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachutial glider, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon relates how, in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media had circulated under the parachutial glider society, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the Palu partners who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were answered only with one gray mark, rather than two blue legal marks.
"I think it means the messages aren't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during refill of OTM at Newport on the Mave

Kanye West: Ripper changes his name to Ye
Ripper Kanye West will change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote, "The being once known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has for some time been nicknamed Ye and has used the nickname as the title for its eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that he will introduce his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Aria Grande on the program that canceled for “emotional reasons, ” said the program’s manufacturer.
Besides being an abbreviation of his present professional name, West has in the past said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio-aver Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, who means the only one, to only Yes – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known, among other things, as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy of Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West-fellow worker, JAY-Z, has also been completed with or without a link sign and upper case.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexical pass - chosen President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador went on to promise the country’s 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students never to use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday to use "never use the army to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot on October 2, 1968, on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza where as many as 300 people died at a time when leftist student movements developed throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities drew youth to gangs.
US must double KI Funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount it spends on research in that field, investor and AI-practian Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The comments come after various parts of the US government have made AI announcements, even if the VS is short a total formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, last year China announced their plan: they aimed to be the No. 1 in KI-innovasia by 2030.
"Dubbel the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
The doubleing of funding can double the chances that the next major AI performance will be achieved in the U.S., said Lee Vandeesweek in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" of late month was published by Hohton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, face++.
In the 1980's at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that had knocked the highest ill - approved American Othrolo player and later he was an executive officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions of the VS government, such as the Defends Advanced Research Projects Agency’s robotics challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, said Lee.
"It isn't China that takes the academic leaders away; it's the corporatocracy," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have in recent years appointed influential individuals from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help assist the U.S. AI's efforts.
"I think green maps must be offered automatically to PhD's in AI," he said.
China’s State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artistic Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people of academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to VS researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, said Lee.
Earlier this year the VS Department of Defense had established a joint center of artificial intelligence intended to involve partners from the industry and the academic world, and the Withouse announced the formation of a elite committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a initiative called AINext.
As for the NSF, it now invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, VS legislation that had a goal of creating a National Security Commission on Artistic Intelligence came under fire months of last months.
Macedonians Need to Change in election or Country’s Name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum about whether their name should be changed to "Reveal of Northernacedonia", action that would resolve a decades-old dispuut with Greece that blocked its membership butter to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, with a province named Macedonia, insists that their northern neighboring name represents a demand in the area and has refused entry into NATO and EU.
The two governments made an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalistic opponents reasoned that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign had cast doubt about whether the attendance would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum voice letter read: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price to be paid to admit Macedonia, one of the countries that had come out of the collapse of Yugoslavia, to such bodies as EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough parliament members said that they would accept the results of the mood to decide.
The name change will require a second-time emerity in Parliament.
By 1 p.m., the state’s election commission said there were no reports of excesses.
But the attendance was then only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital city of Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Duhko utter their voices for the referendum in Macedonia about the change of the country’s name that will open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Stratica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarov, 54, prepared a small restaurant and drew chairs in front of tents set up by those who went to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads high up, not by the back door." said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the great majority will be in favor of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he had brought out his voice.
He said a "yes" rash would be "affirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Policy Research Institute said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum--less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, attendance must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A relapse in the referendum will be the first serious setback for the policy of a pro-Wester government since the government took over last year in May.
Watch: Manchester City’s Segio Aguero navigates throughout Brighton Defense for Purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton Defense in Manchester City’s 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goal kicker received at the beginning of the series at the center field.
He chased between three Brighton-verdone before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed by one defender before he had passed several more on the edge of the Brighton-purchased.
He then pushed a passing to the left, where he found Starling.
The English forecaster used his first touch in the cage to send back the ball for Aguero, which used his right foot to knock the Brighton-in-designed Mathew Ryan with a kick into the right side of the net.
"Aguero struggles with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We're fortunate that he made a point at that moment."
But it was Sterling that gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the premierliga-cruitation.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
At that stake, Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some touch before leading Starling to the far target corner.
The Sky Blues forecaster kicked the ball in the net just before it was over the back line.
City Toll Hoffenheim in Kampioeneliga Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arenna in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the game against Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playing battle, there is little reason to force another beginning.
But the ever-compending Scherzer wants to embrace the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still legislatives for the Rockies, which have one game-prong over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies had at least a procar choice place with a 5-2 winning over the Nationals Friday evening, but still wanted to capture their first philosophy title.
"Although we don't play for anything, we can at least play the game knowingly that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point of this year.
Why should I not want to participate in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their initial player for Sunday but are reportedly favorable to have Scherzer throw into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th start, had a throw-trained session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest-Sunday.
The Washington right-handed is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outhals in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court choice of Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid - term election.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
It's one of the big big--I don't stand, but I actually stand and that's why I fight all over for these candidates," he said.
Trump went on, 'One sees this horrible, horrible radical group Democrats, one sees it happening now.
And now they are determined to take back the power by using any means possible, one sees the malice, the genius.
They don't mind who they hurt, who they must walk to get power and control, that's what they want, power and strength, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, were on a mist to "stand and hinder."
"And one sees it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats " evil and mean and geniusy and false."
He was referring on the name to Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Diane Feinstein, who received a loud cheer from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Have you allowed the document to be leaked?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting one--it was really weak body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labor party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant of those who say what they think
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to put me underic acid, it was not a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of Labour Party LPs who was told we're not welcome-- everything because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she fearlessly stood up against anti-semitism.
In my case, the motion of senic acid criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
Of the importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, ironically enough similar issues over which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party Meeting Friday said that "We want the meetings to be extravagant and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party LP, that was exactly what Friday evening's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of "kinder, more gracious" politics has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It has become increasingly evident that various views are not tolerated within the Labor Party and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had shared similar political views before began expecting me to make a U turn and take in positions I would never otherwise agree with-- whether on national security or the EU-elmark.
Whenever I speak in public--and it doesn't really matter what I say-- follows a tirade of abusive speech on social media that asks me not to be resicked, disapproval of politics from the core, and telling me not to be in the Labour Party.
And that’s not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed to me are political.
I have a lot of respect for the professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a barrage of sexualistic or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have romanticized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labor Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer that broad church and with every "mode of mistrust" or change of selection rules becomes the party ender.
For the past two years, I have had much advice that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so outspoken, and then I will be "oldui".
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since joining the Labor Party 32 years ago, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether a local council member or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my policies and areas where I am different from the present leadership.
To those who advocated the motions on Friday, I can only say that with the country heading for a Brexit, who will harm all households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Labour Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no amount of threats from not being reselect or political advantage will hold me back from doing what I believe in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr above
Two late threes may have misapplyed the final outcome slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr has deserved to triumph in this wonderful-making Tennent's Presence Game of the Day.
They are now at the top of the score, the only unconquered team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better hold of chance, that carried the home crew, and that coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our contests so far and we're still unconquered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Honor Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was intended by Frazier Climo, made Ayr before, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the contest by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to have the numbers numbered, and Jason Baggot recorded an unintended three.
Climo enlarged Ayr's advantage with a ruffy kick, just before resting time a solorite meant to make it rest 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, intended by Baggot, reduced the back to five points.
There was a long checkout for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott carried on a stretcher, and from the restart Ayr increased the advantage with a Stafford McDoowall-three, intended by Climo.
Ayr's acting Captain Blair Macferson then found a yellow card and once again used Melrose the extra player with an unintended three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of much pressure game.
The home crew made a return, and when Struan Hutchinson found a yellow card because he had taken off for Climo without the ball, and stood out of the prison line MacPherson had put the ball to death behind the rising Ayr-losted meal.
Climo had intended this, as he had also done almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's goal and soon Gregor Henry had sent away for the home team's fifth three.

'The sea is ours: land ringed Bolivia hopes court will reopen off to Pacific
Matrose patrols a mastworked naval quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are with broaking with the slogan, "The sea is to correct ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the surveyed Bolivia, the memory of the coastline they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh - nest the need to ply the Pacific again.
That hope is probably the highest that it was in decades, while Bolivia awaits a verdict by the international court of law on October 1, after 5 years of talks.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peaceableness, and obviously expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look the IGH decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia’s claim that after decades of spradic negotiations – Chile is obliged to bargain to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – who next year faces a controversial battle of reselection – also has much that depends on Monday’s pronunciation.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor – and that few will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that IRH's verdict comes only six months after the last arguments shows that the case was "not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean authority in international law.
And rather than assist Bolivia’s cause, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The question of access to the sea was hijacked by the present Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric caused any remaining Chilean sympathy, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue discussions again at a time, but it will be extremely difficult to carry out nasty talks.
The two countries had not exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationships with Chile" and a chance to end 139 years of differences with betting benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still used one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – the sea voyage issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless they can trust US
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm their nuclear weapons first if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill the promises made at a conference in Singapore between the rival countries ’ leaders.
His remarks follow VS state secretary Mike Pompeo's apparently on the edge to restart nuclear diplomats, which had reached a dead end, more than three months after Singapore with NorthCore's Kim Young Un.
Ri says it's a "dromic image" that continued sanctions and VS copy to a declaration which ended the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without first taking significant steps to disarmament.
Both Kim and VS president Donald Trump want a second conference.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about doing what the country considers to be the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump conference.
Paris fashion displays reveal the latest series of large head coverings en route to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or totally turn away from the sun, you don’t have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of obscene oversize head coverings to their SS19 collection on the walkboard that had enchanted the style at Paris Modeweek.
Extremely impractical hats have permeated this summer Instogram, and these designers have paraded their mind - boggling creations on the walkboard.
The excel by Valentino was an oversize beigh with a featherlike wide edge which swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversize accessories included melons decorated with jewels, a sorcerer hat, and even a pineapple--but it's not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation seemed like scuba equipment, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another looked like a molten ice cream croak.
And if you continue the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Style watchers predict that the massive hats may be on their way to the shops near you.
The oversize hats follow closely on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-footed edge seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat spread about social, sent another great creation over the walkboard--a straw-sand bag almost as large as the swimming model that wore it.
The burned orange raffiasac, sewed off with rafphiafrais and sewed a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Rivera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Well - known silent Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and sandbags appearing in stores for next summer--as the designer has made such a huge impact that it will be difficult to ignore demand for large additives.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools took a rite of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which were only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music, and other community enterprises.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), seek the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a newly produced school curcuum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable class choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English only when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest rate of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 membership schools showed that 72 percent of students had achieved a higher degree A in Mandarin Chinese, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish were also given an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now, as a subject choice, have the same prestige as the CESTM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' kurrikula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Calls and Skills found in 2014 that some of the reasons employees provide why they struggle to fill posts are due to 17 percent to a shortage of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more probable jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globbalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to converse, and Frans was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why investing in today’s children’s language education is so important now.
Knowing various languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered necessary for the UK when looking ahead at 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching personnel who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be detected at this point, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages must truly be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
Il faut bin le faire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeSource will make debut for San Diego Lakers on Sunday
The guard is almost over for adherents to see LeSource James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play at the Denver Nuglets in San Diego in Sunday’s front season opening contest.
But just how many minutes he will play remains to be determined.
"That will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official Web site.
Lakers reporter Mike Truudell has come to know that James will probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the preseason program.
"I don't need to get ready at this point in my career pretime contests," he said.
Torump's West Virginia Convention Time, YouTube Canal
President Donald Trump begins tonight. A wave of election events in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump’s first of five scheduled tups in the following week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the affirmation voice currently held back for its choice to fill the vacancies in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the coming intermediate because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voted in November.
How late is Trump's gathering in Western Virginia tonight and how do you view it online?
Trump's gathering in Wheeling, Western Narginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m., Tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can look below via living influx at Trump's meeting in Western Virginia.
Trump will probably give attention to the trials of this week for the designated Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who had become tense about accusations of sexual misconduct with a anticipated confirmation voice held back for a week while the FBI was investigating.
However, the main point of this excess is to help the Republicans facing difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus said that these five coops in the following week are aimed at visiting "amens and supporters while Republicans try to protect and enlarge the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control over Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused his name to be called Reuters.
This evening's gathering, arranged for the Westbancoarena in Wheeling, can pull supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with over 40 percentage points, visits.
Torump tries to help the West Virginic Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, which is behind, according to voice patterns.
"It's not for Morrisey a good sign that the president must come to give him a boost at the pollbus," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Western Narginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder cup 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have courage for the struggle to keep the hope alive when they enter Sunday single game
After three one - sided sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of momentum is an overallly contrived sports concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions like that.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
"They walked out with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a little momentum, I guess," said Jordan Speth when he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead and another twelve being played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there's a lot to encourage them, not the least class of Speth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each recorded three points from four.
Spieth was lethal from the base to the clean ground and leads by his example.
Those choir celebrations became louder as she progressed round and he sank a critical stylus to win match four completely even while he and Thomas were after two rounds with two behind.
She kept the game wining at 15 for them was greeted with a similar scream, the sort that tells a man that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You must really just take out everything and worry about your own game," said Speth.
That is all those players now have left.
18 Puppies for putting off their stamp.
The only players who over the past two days have more points than Spith and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unhesitating story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s couples but charming couple got four out of four and can’t do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only few who did not record one blow over track count on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one blow over track and during the rear nine Friday morning.
That runs, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this boisterous crowd, confirm that they are the players to be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can bind a potential European victory when the sun passes over Le Gulf National bag.
Elevably both simultaneously or at different wells.
It is too early, however, to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short meteors with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four -bal hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One held over lanes and two doubles on the front nine brought the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they could not even come.
Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four balls and four - game teams are so exciting to watch from close because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has always played better as a team so far and has spearheaded the last day, but this four - game session also showed that the team of the U.S. had the courage for the struggle that some, especially at home, doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's quadruple and four games with an advantage of 10-6.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Gulf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, has an American team that has spaced roughly in the morning's four balls, so that they won the series 3-1.
The US became more resistant to the four games and won two games but did not shrink the back.
Jim Furich’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single games to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newling to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second few in the history of the Ryder Cup that after their first four matches have recorded four points.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls, they played superbly together to conquer a pap Woods and American newling Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5 & 4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but now lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's fourballs, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2kanth printing for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koppka--which is first and third on the world class.
Europe, however, did not always get their way on a pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won a great tournament three times, and Justin Thomas set the mark for Americans on Saturday with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2Monand1 victory over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3,4 in the four games after losing the first two wells.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup repaired a team of four points when they entered the single game, even though Furich's team only has to play a draw to preserve the trophy because they already like it.
After they had been second for two days, however, they didn't seem to do a counterattack on Sunday.
NorthernCore says they'll certainly not disarm 'one sided without confidence.
On Saturday, NorthCore’s minister of foreign affairs told the United Nations that continued sanctions were worsening their distrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons tysily without such properties.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual General Assembly that in the past year, NorthCore had struck "significant goodwill measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, tearing down the nuclear test ground, and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We see, however, no corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we shall certainly not disarm ourselves one sidely first."
While Ri repeated well - known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a "tangled" approach to removal of nuclear weapons that would reward NorthCore if taken gradual action, his words seemed significant by rejecting unsubstantiated one - sided removal of nuclear weapons, as Pjongjang did in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Young-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim made to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for the safety of NorthCore.
NorthCore wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pjongjang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests to relax strict international sanctions against NorthCore.
"The U.S. insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by intensifying the level of the sanctions to achieve their purpose in a compelling way, and even to protest the declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The presspsy that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions aggravate our mistrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader had called attention earlier in the week at the United Nations.
Rather, the minister focused on three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jie-in and added: "If the party had been in this question about destroying nuclear weapons SouthCore and not the U.S.A., the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different than last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that NorthCore's rockets would be directed on the US country mass after "Mr. Evil President" Torump for Kim called a "firerrowman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to destroy NorthCore "completely," Kim praised his courage for taking steps to disarm, but he said that much work had yet to be done, and that sanctions still have to stay there until North Medicine nuclear weapons were destroyed.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a timeframework for this, and said "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must reward Pjong’s steps.
But, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "Application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue zealously and without letup until we reintroduce the full, final, established destruction of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unitedly intensified sanctions against NorthCore since 2006 in an effort to raise funds for Pjongjang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and afterward said that he would visit Pjongjang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited NorthCore this year three times, but his last trip there had not gone well.
He left Pjongjang in July and said that progress had been made, but just hours later, he accused him of making "bandlike demands."
In a meeting with Moon, NorthCore promised to break down a missileist and also take a nuclear complex as the United States "corresponding measures."
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted to see were security sponsors promising Trump in Singapore as well as steps toward normisation of relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course about enough rest.
A new course at Harvard-university this year allows all of its pregraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing macho culture of study by cafphein - driven whole night sessions.
A Akademicus found that students at the world’s top identity are often ignorant when it comes to the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after he spoke about the effect of sleeping deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me this first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep is--what surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university had decided to take the course after it was found that students had been taken seriously during the week.
The hour - long course involves some interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a sleeping hall, where students should click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes, and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep loss and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long - term sleep deprivation can increase risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think of their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' added Proprof Czeisler.
The culture of pride to study 'night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever - increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation to be a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's secret weapon should be to avoid stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even to avoid gaining weight, because sleeping deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old Californiar who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after taking one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened its eyes and inspired him to work for a campwide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of ' blou light' emitted by electronic screens and LED-lights, which could disrupt your sircanian rhythm and lead to your having difficulty touching the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Purpose of Menga conquers Gerard’s men
Rangers had another sarsia offsimized when Dolly Menga's target kick Steven Gerrard's ungady team was concerned with a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team wanted to win them first as visitors from February's 4-1-cege at St Johnsstone, but Gary Holt’s team gave Gerriard only his second layer in 18 contests as manager, so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, running loose hands in the Ladrores Precious.
Menga struck seven minutes before rest, and it didn't seem that a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on target difference.
And there may be further trouble for Rangers after border judge Callum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the side.
Gerand made eight changes to the team that rushed past Ayr to the final battle of the Bethfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a tip of Hearts last week and he would have been in his nopsies with the way his well-trained team had smothered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball ownership, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
Actually, after only two minutes, they should have noted points when Menga’s first rebutt Scott Pitman passed through on Allan McGoreor’s goal, but the middle field player pulled his big chance open.
A deep kick by Keahan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense measure Alan Lithgow could only kick dung at the rear target post.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have received a prison term when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but the referee Steven Thomson turned away the Colombian request.
Rangers managed to get only two shots at the target during the first half, but former Ibrox-designed Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana sybaly's head shot and a tame goal kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener may have been toward game at the 34th minute, no one can deny that they earned it, even though it is only for their hard work.
Rangers didn't once again handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool head and sent it to Menga for a simple finishing.
Gerard took action at the break when he traded Schemely for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but rushed the impressive Kelly from his line to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halket, who had palmed long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come in far from the corner point.
Rangers ’ substitute Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a criminal kick when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geigerder
And now a page out of our "Sday morning" almanak: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and our TEAR... the day on which future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geigerteller.
Since then, the editor has been a support of science, and it has also become a pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is it?"
Rogers: "It's a author used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these earphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Gutists, it's cracking about!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention bearing his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see robber cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill robber cells
Ent dust teaches immune system to identify robber cells as part of treatment
Method involves retrieval from immune cells from a patient, changing them in a laboratory
They can then see a protein 'see' that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify robber cells, saw her oval cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves withdrawal from immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can reinject a protein that occurs in many cancers and is called HER2.
Professor Jay Berzovsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "Put on the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, oval, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Profprof Berzovsky.
A similar approach to remove immune cells from patients and teach them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West began a pro-Trump mockery after his action at SNL, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was expelled in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a prolonged action in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would set himself preferable in 2020.
After singing his third song of evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he railed against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I speak so often to a white man and they say, 'How can you like tump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago," he said.
SNL began the show with an outline with Matt Damon in which Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate’s judicial committee on accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the image material of West was loaded on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear that Rock tried to mock West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that behind the stage it was made difficult for him to deal with what he was carrying on his head.
"They cheered me behind the platform.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat on it.'
They cheered me up!
And then they say I'm in a low place,' he said according to Washington Examiner.
West went: "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would wear his "supermanship, because that means you can't tell me what I should do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
At least twice his comment elicited an outing from the audience and members of the SNL role division seemed embarrassed, Variey reported, with one person there saying to the publication: "The whole studio has become silent."
West was brought in as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, droveman Mac Miller a few days earlier had died.
West was very surprised by the execution of the song I Love Iit, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who rocked: "To one of the most bold spirits: THANK YOU RESURN TO THE SAVING. "
But chat utility woman Karen Hunter wive that West was simply "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") which I believed to accept an ideology and preach that endangers my community.
He is free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhymer on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the being once known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Fellowry-mkletser, Snapp Dogg, had the name Snope Lion and, of course, the late musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was once known as Prince.

Game of Thronesster Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword - turning role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series of Game or Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they should be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow star out of Game or Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'reasonablely strong' about working on this issue.
'I personally feel quite strong about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught husbands as they grow up with regard to the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity because of its extremely male characters.
He continued: "What is inborn and what has been taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think that this is really one of the big questions in our time--how do we change it?
Because something evidently went wrong with our young men.'
in the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the Game or Tryones-reed and -reed items when the series next summer came to an end, for he said he was 'explained with battlefields and horses'.
From November on, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a movie manufacturer and his brother, who is a robber.
Recently, the actor revealed that he thought that the best thing that came out of Game or Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritette, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-crownd fantasy series.
The couple were married on the property of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens who live with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, representing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to near zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transfer by sex is a critical case in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was mobilized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many transfers of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV indicator as part of an effort to make the matter work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has leaked GOP-senators' data, condemned 'dangerous lies' and 'consistation theories'
US Republican Maxine Wanders denounced claims on Saturday that a member of her staff had placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislatures' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were prompted by "ultrarights" experts and Web sites.
"Leusens, lying and still abominable lies," said Wanders in a statement on Twitter.
The highlighted information reportedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers for U.S.- Sens. Lindsey Graham from SouthCarollina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday online, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate panel's trial on the claims of sexual misconduct against the designated Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place sometime after the three Senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative Web sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was connected with Waters ’ office and reported the information of a member of Waterers ’ staff, the Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is utterly false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff--whose identity, personal information and security were endangered as a result of this deceitful and false claim--was by no means responsible for licking this information.
This baseless claim is utterly false and an absolute lie."
Wanders ’ statement soon elicited online criticism, including former Whitehouse purple representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she did not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Wattlers ’ reaction to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seeming to be too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tried to lift Waters in the intersecting out of the pillows, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great as that is true," he rocked.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these deceptive claims.
"We will make sure that the deceivers are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally accountable for all that they do which is in ruins and dangerous for every member of my staff."
Johnny English Drivers Against Remence - fool Rowan Atkinson spying
It is now traditionally to look for Brexit meanings in any new movie with British overtones, and it seems applicable to this revival of Johnny English Action Comer the ridiculefinchise-- which began with Johnny English in 2003 and was struggling further with Johnny Englishborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-pies even atire on the subject of how obvious power we are be the nation's new export opportunity?
At any rate, the unholded Johnny English with his molts and rubber face had renewed his license to waste everything for the second time--and his name was a clearer indication than anything else that he was a great comical creation for non-English - speaking movie hearings.
Of course, he is the silly secret agent who, in spite of his bizarre amusement to sophisticated elogansia, has a little bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean and a good skit of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international man of riddles, who left chaos behind him, who at once played Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard advertisements.
There are one or two cute moments in this latest version of JE.
I liked Johnny English who walked toward a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval coat of mail and cut the screws briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humor feels quite faint and peculiarly superfluous, especially when the "serious" movie - trade marks such as 007 and Massion Impossible now themselves use comedy with confidence as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed to children rather than to adults, and to me Johnny is English’s adversity less original and focused than Atkinson’s silent films in the Blueon of Bean.
The perpetual tematic assumption is now that Great-Britain is in serious trouble.
A cuber has filterd Britain's supersecret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty--a deplorable little scroll for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a puffed up and besieged character, who is already experiencing a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson does her utmost with this quasi-Tresa May character, but there is but little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since each active spy was threatened, she should call someone out of retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now in service as a teacher at some elegant institution, but that gives lessons from the record down on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-like spying school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long - suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander door, an allamapstics role in which too little is expected of Viki Peperdine.
So the Batman and Robin are from wasting everything completely in Her Majesty's secret service again on duty and on Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femmy fatalal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister ends up under the dangerous charm of charismatic technology billionaire claiming to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey from ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters set them on fire a French restaurant, they cause chaos as they smuggle themselves onto the deck of Volta’s luxury hunt; and English break out sheer anarchy when he tries to use a headhead for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta’s house.
For that last scene, nothing is spared, but as cute and boisterous as it may be, the whole affair is quite much like children'sTV.
Reasonable middle self.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking: can the British not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to his right?
Labor denies that it's a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a drastic plan which will cause British Britons to work a four - day week--but for five days to be paid.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to save that was caused by the artificial intelligence (KI) revolution to workers by giving them off extra day.
This will make workers enjoy a three - day week, but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that at the party's economic agenda and plans to introduce the country into favor with the workers, it'll fit'.
To change to a four - day week was subscribed to by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party Source told The Sunday Times: A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four - day week is a ambition that fits into the party's approach to re-balance the economy in favor of the worker as well as the party's total industrial strategy.
The Labor Party will not be first to subscribe to such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four - day week during its campaign for the general election in 2017.
At present, however, the ambition is not supported by the entire Labor Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: A four-day week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow minister John McDonnell used last week’s Labor Conference to elaborate on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'faceless directors' and 'profits' to service enterprises.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current stockholders in water companies may not recover their entire investment because a Labour Government can make 'offions' on the basis of supposed wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on board companies and create unrealistic ownership funds to give 10 percent of exclusive business enterprises in the private sector to employees, who can obtain from as much as £500 annually.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has a final mood on his naming to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the bureau’s findings can convince any Republicians to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republicansens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could make anything change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from SouthCarolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it had happened. That accusation came out, and said, 'Did you do it?
He was determined, certainly, unequivocal."
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be immutable.
"I formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett actively denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all she calls could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I see nothing new changes."
What is the World Citizen festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizen Festival, an annual music opportunity which has a particularly impressive group of stars that act and have an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizen Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy performances not only by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mends but also to create awareness for the occasion’s real purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Peace Project, an international intercessor who hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free card to the occasion (unless you are willing to pay for a BBP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other significant means of creating awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years remaining to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so - called "venitary"--people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a trick?
Since 2011, World Citizen has said it has recorded over 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which support a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions helped encourage world leaders to announce unions and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that would potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 unions and announcements resulting from his performances, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the established money has had a direct impact so far on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important unions include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementrs committed to helping children reach their full potential, and promised to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after getting more than 4,700 twmies of World Citizens.
"With support from the government of the UK, donors, national governments and World Citizens just as you are, we can let the social injustice of malnutrition become a footnote in history," said the Power of Nutrition-ambassssaor, Tract Ullman in April 2018 during a concert in London to the crowd.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions done to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the general questions on his website that ask "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
World Citizen answered, "It will be a long and hard road--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-aparty movements before us, we will be successful, because we have more strength together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who act in New York on this year’s occasion, which will be offered by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use fleet for "blockade" to block Russian energy - minister of domestic affairs
"Innten" Washington can leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from getting into the market, including in the Middle East, revealed the U.S. Secretary of Home Affairs Ryan Zineke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria--in particular where it works on the invitation of the lawful government--is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East, is that they want to act as brokers for energy as they do in Eastern Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to an officer, there are ways and resources to deal with them.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not end up on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the settlers of an opportunity offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit hunting who considered themselves the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
He continued to compare Washington’s approaches to the handling of Russia and Iran and noted that they were practical.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said while referring to Russia as a "single) with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The pronouncements come as Trump Administration on a mist was to boost the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, at far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump Administration officials, including America’s president Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unpassed" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump Berlin, makes Moscow’s "prisoned."
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nordic Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic feet [110 billion cu m], is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is merely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means to carry out pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Alexandr Novak, to a meeting with America's Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. viewpoint provoked antirespondence from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s prominent industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), appealed to the U.S. to keep clear of EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), to a recent meeting with German Kansselier Angela Merel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will consider it "earnestly" to stand as president in 2020, said Massachusetts Senator.
Massachusetts Senator, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday she would consider it "seriously" to stand as president after the middle term election.
During a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and that includes a woman on the highest sport," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider standing for president."
Warren expressed her opinion about President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said he was taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I am up to my innermost concern about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In Friday, Warren said "naturally we need an FBI investigation before our voice."
A survey released on Thursday revealed that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think that she should stand in 2020.
Eight-fivety percent of "probably" Massachusetts selectors said the Senator shouldn't stand, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Survey.
Two-and-thirty percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former Governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea of facing potentially and 48 against it.
Other high - profile Democratic names discussed to be possible in 2020 include former vice president Joe Bien and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Prayen said he would officially decide in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin callsTrack Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining September
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is passing through, which he has gone through since he returned, I have sympathy for other families who sense the consequences of PTSD and the wound with which our soldiers return," she told an audience during a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back stiffly, they come back and wonder if there is the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and Air Force members and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assault of a woman, interference with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a gun while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District Columbia support a legal challenge of a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims who flee gang violence or household violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend of the court-right Commission Friday in Washington to support an asylum applicant and to challenge the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions-puting that the American Civil Libertic Union filed against federal policy in August was not made public.
She said her partner "and his violent gangboys," abused her, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The government attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for VS mob, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new VSationl policy, in 2014, reversed a decision by the Board of Imigrant Apples (Rad of Immigrant-appèlls) that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents that fled from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Columbia's attorney General Karl Racine stated on Friday in a statement that the new policy "decades' state, federal and international laws ignore."
"Federal laws require that all asion searchs be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the demand, and such lawyers violate that policy," said the friend-of-the Court Law Commission.
Supportors further argued in the legal command that the policy that immigrants refuse access damages the VS economy and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and will provide "necessary labor."
Procureur-General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop standing up to victims fleeing because of domestic and gang violence.
"soul is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Soul was never intended to alleviate all problems — even all serious problems — facing people around the world every day.
Poor rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly revealing.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while she comforted her feverish baby boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen returning to their ruined homes, searching through saturated possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 range of quakes, were overwhelmed.
From the injured, including Dwi Haris, who got a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's army hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth story - story hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the walls' debris, I think,' Haris told Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
VS-ambassa door accuses China of 'promoving' with 'probidial-adtension'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper that commends the mutual benefits of V.S.-Chrina trade, the VS-ambassssa door accused China Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
VS- President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily’s paid inset in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa’s newspaper with most sales – after accusing China of mixing into the VS Conference Selections of November 6, a complaint that denies China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election has marked what VS officials told Reuters, a new phase in a growing Washington campaign is to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to put advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are presently trapped in an escalative trade war that has led them to leveled tartives on each other’s imports.
China’s retribution rates early in the trade war had a goal of beating exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and VS experts.
Terry Bran City, the VSambasssa door for China and former Iowa governor for a long time, a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion case in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "Now cheer the bullying by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government grabs America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited dissenting voices and not see any real reflection of the differing opinions the Chinese people have had about China's alarming economic trajek, that media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that although he didn't say which newspaper, one of China's most prominent newspapers shy away from the offer to publish his article.
Republicanine alienates women selectors before interselecting with Kavanaugh-debakel, warns analysts
While many top-Repubaline stands at Supreme Court-genomineed Brett Kavanaugh and defends himself in the face of various claims of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see reaction reaction during the coming intersects, especially of women.
The emotions about this run high, and most Republicans are on record that they already indicate that they want to continue in the mood.
Those things can't be reversed,' said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University'swell School for The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s approach for an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to appease severe voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday--they're not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group Move On Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters "November is on the way!" roared as they protested in the entrance hall of the Senate while the Republicanine who controlled the Judicial Committee had chosen to continue with Kavanaugh's naming in spite of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high," said Sttu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the newsyard.
"People say it was already high; it's true.
But it may be higher, especially under swinging voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony setting out the details of her accusation of sexual assault against the Supreme Courtmen, analysts said that if Republicane continues with the confirmation, an reaction could follow.
"It became a messing mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It isn't about the committee's voice or the final voice and whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," pointed out to the news channel to Guy Cecil, director of Privacy USA.
But Americans look slightly divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more of the latter’s side.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably Ford's testimony believes, while 35 say they certainly or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh had probably or definitely been cranking during his witnessing, while only 30 percent had said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s approach, the FBI is now investigating the charges made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainer, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, under oath before the Senate’s Judicial Committee, Ford testified that Kavanaugh had assaulted her while he was drunk at 17 years of age.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-genomined exposed his private parts to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global Web plans to start a new Internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the global web, launch a beginning business attempting to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The technology-leating's latest project, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to select where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt is "world domination".
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or an POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it rests entirely with the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and relevant skills to help Solid make available to everyone.
The company is now made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contractd to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Beginning this week, technology developers from all over the world can create their own commercialized applications by using the utility tools available on the Inrupt Web site.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about introducing a total change though not, where all their business models are completely overturned overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a position on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to supply commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee turned the Internet when he founded the Globalweb Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past months, Berners-Lee had an influential voice in the debate about civility.
Even as he launchs Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the Globalweb Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am immensely optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross clergyman
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
In the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt, site Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had earned the highest British military honor.
A pillar was revealed by his two grandsons on Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's crowned achievement.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his battalion across the Channel de Saint-Quentin "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed to the firing line and led the line forward with the greatst bravery before he rushed man-only a field rifle and knocked out three of the ward.
At least Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I know I can never live up to, but something humbling."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also lay a cliff after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth orchestra.
Michael Vann said he felt "feeled to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support which a lot of people will give."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just not being able to see the main event.
The San Jose program featured 13 battles, including six on the main program that was to be broadcast directly by night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying specially awake for the battle into the early hours.
One supportr described on Twitter the switch to the children's cartoon as "one or other ill joke."
"It is governmental lawment that the contents at 6 p.m. were not suitable and therefore they had to turn over to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pepp the pog," yes."
Bellator Company President Scott Coker said they'll work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think of the transmission, I think we can probably figure out something," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to record it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it was switched over, there were many text messages sent back and again and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to correct it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit this to five fights instead of six - such as we normally make – and we have tried to offer more to our adherents and just get over our time.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert IslandDiscs: Tom Daley felt 'redientia' about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to his sexuality--but this gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24 - year - old said he didn't before he went to high school realized that "not all like me are."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert IslandDiscs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he had aired his feelings over gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that it had become a parent, let him care less about winning at the Olympics.
The regular volunteer of the years' program, Kirsty Young, took care of disease for a few months.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everybody else when he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day those feelings are of less than, and else feel, the true things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so that he did not disappoint anyone when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
Using its appearance at this year’s Commonwealth games in Australia, the double Olympic brivalen became a high profile-LGBT fighter to appeal to more countries to cover homosexuality.
He says he expressed his feelings because he was so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and to give others "hope".
The trimal world champion said that to fall in love with a man – VS filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013--' caught him on his side."
Daley married the Oscar-wenner last year, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been a question.
"When you go through so much at such a young age"-- he went to his first Olympic Games at age 14 and his father died three years later to cancer--he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar altitudes and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything had gone over 'I must win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says that his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked if they had cards for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here in the front row, Dad'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed my life long--to dive before my home years at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired its first song choice — Proud by Heather Small – who also had been living with him in the building up to the Olympics and still gives him chicken meat.
Desert IslandDisces is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson does not fly and withdraw from Saturday’s Ryder Cup
American Phil Micllson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47nd Ryder Cup match, but he will have to manage his shape to prevent it from being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12th time in the two-annual event, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Furich for Saturday's quadrumball games and four dates.
Instead of being the focal point of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five - fold Major-winner will divide his day between being cheerleader and working at the exercise bov at his game in hopes of correcting what is bad.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the straightest driver, so the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National court where the long ruveld always punishes the wandering blow.
And as if the track on its own were not challenging enough, Mickelson came to stand in his ninth match on Sunday against the accurate British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who united with newling Tommy Fleetwood to win all four their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points behind, start the 12 single games well, Micelson’s game can be absolutely necessary.
Furich expressed his trust in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He fully understood his role that he had today, gave me a knock on the back, and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," said Furich.
"He had much confidence in himself.
He was in the Held Hall, and he contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think he would play two games.
I had more prospect, but that is how things worked out and that’s what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the track, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Sunday Nick Faldo’s record for the player who played most Ryder Cup matches.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never really harmonized with the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 nenders, and seven halfs, although Furich said that his presence contributed intangible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, taken, liked to shave the fool, and he's a wonderful guy to have in the teamroom," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him, which was fun to see.
He offers as much as just game."
Europe capital Thomas Bjorn knows great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage before the last day's single game in the Ryder Cup can easily change into an uncomfortable experience.
The Den made his debut in the 1997 contest at Valderrama, where the team led by Sve Ballestros had a five-point advantage, but only barely won with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we had barely won," said Bjorn, on the picture, after watching how the Class of 2018 Friday had won 5-3, and yesterday 10-6 before was at Le Gulf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that it is not over.
You're going to be full of speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a purpose, and it's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I say all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are in our team, but we are also well aware of who stands on the other side-- the best players in the world."
Rejoiced at how his players sailed on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never move ahead of these things.
Tomorrow is a horse of another color.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes in turn, and it's a horse of another color.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're there individually, you're being tested for your full capacity as a golf player.
That's the message you have to deliver to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furich would want his players to travel better individually than they did as playmates, with the exception of Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who received three points from four.
Furich itself had been on both sides of those great last day rounders, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended as loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every written word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, boldly talked his players into the way to that last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as was seen at Brookline, as was seen at Medinah.
As that momentum begins to go in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle games.
We set up our team accordingly, and we divided the men that we felt, you know, will bring us some magical things tomorrow."
Thomas got the job of trying to lead the counterattack and getting into the main contest against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the upper half of the division.
"I've chosen this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers up to the end," said Bjorn about his single game options.
Germany’s New Warship Put Off Again
The German army’s latest fregat would have been employed in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it would not be there until at least next year, because of faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The introduction of the "Riinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand - new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fregats have now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
This vessel must have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post delivery issues have plagued this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class fregats.
It is understood that they will have a powerful canon, a battle lines of war and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
But constant delays mean that the advanced warships – which will evidently enable Germany to project power overseas – will already become obsolete by the time they serve, calls Die Zeit.
The disastrous F125fregate reported last year when the German Navy officially refused to hire the vessel and sent it back to Blomh & Vos Tiund in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return mission, but German media called that a number of necessary "families and hardware defects" make the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are especially important, since the Baden-Weutertsberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the manpower on elders Bremen-class fracts.
It also came to light that the ship was drastically overweight, reducing performance and reducing the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Riinland-Pfalz" are thought to be double the weight of ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Besides the faulty hardware, the price label for the entire project--including training the crew-- has also affected a question.
It evidently reached an incredible Nicosia3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial Nicosia2.2 billion.
Problems that haveeted the new frigates become especially important in the face of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy's "ships that can be deployed are getting up."
The official said the issue worsened over time, for old ships were put out of service, but no substitute vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttem class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Bats ’ Secret Life
New research is being carried out on a estate in the Scottish Highland countries that have intended to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to lead future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the ordinary and soprano bat as well as the brown long ear and Daubenton bats at Invasive Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the property at important locations to locate bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also do mobile recordings using hand indicators.
Espert sound analysis of all surveys will check the frequency of bat troops and determine what species are doing.
A Havatcard and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a wildlife conservationist for NTS hope the results will reveal which areas of habitat for bats are most important and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and how best to manage forest countries for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and throughout the UK, mouse populations have declined considerably during the past century.
They are threatened by building and development that affect sleeping quarters and loss of habitat.
Windturbines and lightning may also present a risk, as well as flypaper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-orient orientation technique to show bugs and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [6,000 ha] of land throughout the country, are very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly do recordings and sleeping features and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even set up Scotland’s first and only devoted bat reserve at Threave Lands in Duglries and Galloway home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Landwell manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful territory for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, very old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the need to search for bats before maintenance in properties because it is possible that unwittingly destroying a single maternity place could mean as much as 400 females and young people’s death and kill a whole local population.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or hinder their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo dismisss rape claims while lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed rape claims against him as "false news" and said that people would like to“ promote themselves ” by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The Portugal and Juventus advance player was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a Las Vegas hotel.
He reportedly paid $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram Live-video in which he addresses his 142 million followers, spent hours after the claims, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, false news," said the fivemalish Ballon d'Or-winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that’s part of the whole thing.
I am a happy man and everything is right,' the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyer is getting ready to sue Der Spiegel about the claim, which they called, according to Reuters, "missible reporting of suspicion in the area of privacy."
Procureur Christian Schertz said the player would demand compensation for "moral damages for any amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents lodged at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down to the alleged incident on his knees and said he was "99 percent" an "good old" left in the lurch by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensue.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and at the hospital had pictures of her injuries taken, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was afraid for retaliation and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the settlement because she was still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Manchester United in Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and moved this summer, in a ➣100 million agreement to the Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: UK will repent forever if their car manufacturers lose
The UK would regret it forever if they lost their status as world leader in automobile production to Brexit, said Drive Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "commenced" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would have to stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a gene agreement-Brexit, mails can cost.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – created nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported last year to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU late March, we will see production stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK motor manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about leaving EU without an agreement and how ear - border trade will function.
BMW, for example, said they would include their Mini-plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main dealt with what car manufacturers say is lead - chain risks in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line runs on a "just in time" base, with parts that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars being set up.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be disruption on the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers Plan for future relationships with the EU is "pretypes calibrated to avoid those monitorings at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only to enjoy the present success but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The indications of not only Toyota but also other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to continue with what was an extremely successful set of lead chains."
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped but warned that added expenses in the long term could reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost mails.
Peter Tsallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and the United Union’s collaborator on the plant, says its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back again.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed an exact and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump informing with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Withouse.
Donald Trump's high - risk meeting with deputy attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be deferred "with another week" while the fighting for the high court of Brett Kavanaugh continued, the Withouse said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian election intervention, links between Trump - helpers and Russia, and possible cross - bombing of the right by the president.
Whether Trump will downgrade the deputy attorney general or not, and by it will threaten Mueller’s independence, Washington’s gossip has been a force for months.
Earlier this month the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the Withouse, amid reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "chosen not to thank" for Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate's trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who charged him with sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate consent.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for it has not yet been determined, it may be this week, I can see that it is delayed with another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press on high."
Some journalists would disagree with that statement: Sanders have not held a Whitehouse printing session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions isn't because of a antipriminity for TV journalists who are "effecting", although she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they're crash hunting."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president keeps more V & & management sessions than any president before him," she said, and added without quoting evidence, "We've looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will continue to occur, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly for the president of the United States, then it is infinitely better than to talk to me.
We try to do it a lot, and you have seen it very much in the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignified armies.
Solo press statements are scarce.
In New York Vanesweek, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbound and with times, to appear broarre before journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit-vrese
The secretary of health has written to EU staff in Scotland’s NHS work to express the country’s gratitude and to express the wish that they will stay in Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months remaining before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the legegorized public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During summer negotiations between the UK and EU continued on withdrawal, bound for expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also intensified its preparations for a possible no agreement scenario.
I know this is a very troubled time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much I value each staff member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Collegas from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and which benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie has emergency surgery to main injury
Tennessee State Tigers ’ line player Christion Abercrombie had emergency surgery after he had contracted a main injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee team’s Mike Organ.
Tennessee State’s chief trainer Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the margin and fell sort of just there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen along the margin before being placed on a stretcher and taken backward for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was "no detail about the type/ range of the injury" and Tennessee was still trying to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was at Tennessee State in his first season after moving from Illinois.
He took it five times before he left the game on Saturday, bringing his total for the season at 18 o’clock.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to move young voters
The stamp tax will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The salrie expects to collect up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes when they buy a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's effort to move young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help government plans work against homelessness.
The tax tax - – apart from the current stamp tax, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second homes and homes purchased to rent, could be as much as three percent.
The salrie expects this move to bring in £120 million a year.
A estimated 13 percent of newly built London property is purchased by non-VC citizens who push up the prices and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital-- became "spook towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a debasement in stamp tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of holding property prices high by picking up land but not using it and encouraged Mrs. May to relinquish quotas on affordable homes to repair Britain’s "home disaster".
Corbyn announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rent management and an end to "no error conversions".
He also wants to give councils greater forces to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I will devote my first ministry to restoring the British dream--that life must be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken house market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work, and build a life.
But it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as well as foreign - based companies to buy homes as for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness is too real."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to drive Scotland'
Sunderland-baz Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at one point.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life in the North-East team, which is now in third place in League One, three points under the uppers.
This summer he moved to the City of Light after he led back to the Scottish Presence last season St Mirren.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I took the second team, but it was already," Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsund.
"But as a child I often looked with my father for Scotland at Hampden and it was something that drew me away.
The opportunity, however, can come only if I am successful in club management."
Ross’s predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Aloa Athletic-bas said he felt no terror in imitating such established names at such a large club, after he had previously turned down presentations of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success would be measured for me by ‘'I could have this club returned to the Pre antlika?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it should no doubt be in the Precious League," he said.
"It isn't an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful if I can get the club out there again."
Ross's career in management is only three years ago, after a period as assistant vase at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' training staff.
He then helped Alloa return from legend to the third league and converted St Mirren from the edge of relayment to winners of the Kampionary Title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he said as he recalled how he had taken over Alloa's lesions.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
It sounds blar, for I've done well enough, made a reasonable living out of it, and experienced reasonable peaks.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things to come through weekly.
I still go through it with regard to the stress and pressures of work, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive, and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable that I have been in my own skin throughout my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s struggling bars ’ income but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and bar groups saw sales rising 2.7% in July, but receptions in restaurants were 4.8 percent, showed figures.
Peter Martin, of business consultation firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Sooning sunshine and England's longer than anticipated participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a pattern similar to that of the previous month, June, when drinking places were up with 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were even more severe.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only increased in July.
Dried drinking places and bars did far better and rose more than restaurants had dropped.
Food-trained drinking places suffered in the sun too, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Over management bars and drinking places, sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, with food was down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of recreation and hospitality analyst RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since late April.
Again and the impact of major social or sports events remain the greatest factors in sales in the out-the-house market.
It comes when no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent years on year will be particularly difficult over and without constant expense pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-trained operators and only the time would show whether the more moderate temperatures which we had experienced since August would bring needed relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking places and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the demand in trade marks.

One in five children has secret social media bills that they hide from their parents
One in five children--some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers reveal a survey
Survey of 20,000 high school students has revealed an increase in "false Insta pages"
The news has raised fears that sexual content is placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head account" to show parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media bills that keep them secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has revealed rapid growth in "false Insta-rekeninge" – a reference to the photo-detected Instagram.
The news raised fears that sexual content was being placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "head account" to show parents but had private bills as well.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager urging others to ‘ power her. ’
The research, at Digital Awarenes UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half of them acknowledging to have private bills.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot locate them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "a voice for athletes" on Scottish Atletic Council
Eiidh Doyle was elected to the advice of Scottish Atletics as a non-exporting director at the control body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most worked track-and-field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far - reaching experience at international level during the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect all over the Scottish, UK and world atletic community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will be very beneficial from what she brings to the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as voice for athletes I and hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has the 200 feet [200 m] and 250 feet [400 m] at the 1996 Games in Atlanta under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after he had a brief ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn’t walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work but recovered fully, again learned how to walk, and perform dexterity exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Bors pumpadtension that compares mothers to cows divide opinions online
A pump company has divided opinions online with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.
In celebration of the piloting of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-chosen music music-inspired advertisement to show the freedom the pump gives mother's milking out.
Four real mother's dancing in a barn full of straw and cows on the measure of a song that includes lyrics such as "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen, it's not urns, it's my breasts."
The choir passage reads: "Pomp it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the firm's Facebook page has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 watchings and hundreds of remarks, the video received mixed response from viewers, with many saying it was playing the "ruwelts" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Nests we have to conceive them and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," wrote one.
The Elvie borash pump fits discris rule in a nutritional zebra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person remarked: "Feverly traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why doesn't it use to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The advertisement is so out of touch."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman who admitted that the song was for her "skreusenaak".
"I think it's a romantic idea.
I would have had one if I had continued to breast - feed.
Out of milk made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement was a bit crazy, but I accepted it for what it was.
It's a varied product,' one wrote.
Another person remarked: "It's a fun advertisement directed to mothers who milk out (often in their places of work or toilets) and feel like "cows".
It's not an advertisement praising or judging the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women showed that they had all danced with the discretioned pump in their bra's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discrimination into a feeding zebra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while milking out.
Ana Balarian, partner and UKD in Mother remarked: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a great and provocative introduction.
By drawing a parallel between women who milk out and dairy cows, we wanted to demonstrate the wonderful feeling of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made the news.
During London Modeweek a mother of two appeared on the walkboard for designer Martha Jakubowski as she used the product.
Hundreds of migrants quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of persistent migrants has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because of fel rhetoric and policies set up by the Trump Administration that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country was endangered by acting forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible sponsors and other adult members of their households should have their fingerprints if and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and customs maintenance before Congress testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied to sponsor unparticed minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Aper 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to cope more quickly, officials established new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those considered unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, resulting in violent outbursts or escape efforts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in the past months.
Advokate says those worries are raised at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs indicate that a child is struggling to overlook more easily because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many already have.
Syria tells VS, French and Turkish ‘ conversion forces ’ to withdraw immediately
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid called all-Moulem to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian land, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be handled accordingly.
"They must immediately withdraw and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced, were over.
He said that Damascus will continue "to wage this holy battle until we have purified all Syrian areas" of as well as terror groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which largely oppose both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad and advise.
France with over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the question of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were all right for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "ir - rational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these reins," he said.
"They polytize something that simply must be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to erect a buffer zone in the last great rebel fortress of Idlib opened an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian Turkish agreement averted a large - scale attack by Russian - sponsored Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "evident deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target hihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-Connected Nusra Front who would be "cut off."
UN-gent, Staffan de Missura hopes soon to gather the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to construct an postwar constitution for Syria and open the way to elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to the "nego of the articles of the present constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberally likely hope, a state of accusation and scandals ends his presidency early.
In what without a doubt "the most dramatic final of a presidency will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, peak time rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million peak - time viewers, on 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddown Show" are at the top of cable watch rates with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted, for it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC Drama "Designed Survival" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Parting Into the Hollywood Boxes' Club", has another theory.
She remembered a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
"He said, "For he makes me laugh"," told me. Scovell.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the Washington storylines can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families and reunite the health of the world economy.
Turning out is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, it goes further than being an informed citizen just when in the sixth hour you are watching a panel of experts debate about Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-flyet (a garment thick of the humry," said The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never again look at Super Mario in the same way.
"Parts he does what makes it feel like a reality program is that he carries you something every evening," said Brent Montgomery, executive head of Wheelhouse Entertinment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump programme's varying role division and daily twists in the plot (such as looking for quarrel with N.F.L., Kim Young-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you stay behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was looking inside to MSNBC while taking CNN.
He could not tear himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh was on his way to appear before the Senate’s Regbank and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balances.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs back then and people said, ‘ This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleis to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

Outwards stream to teams of middle-term election races in Home
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th saw an influx of money, thanks to a shift of crate districts that now ended up in a race for the same seat.
The recently modified suburban Pittsburg district lets Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election measures last spring-power.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who presently represents old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were relooped after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decreed that the old districts were unconstitutionably suspended in the Republicans ’ favor.
The race in the new 17th had kicked off with a campaign-finiting competition between the financial legs of the large parties, the Democratic Field Democratic Dachs Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republicial Field Attack Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well - known name in Pennsylvania at a narrow - food winning in a widely looked special election in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congress district.
For more than a decade, the seat was held by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
VS was thinking of basing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then returned to China
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners disfellowshipped the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the government departments decided to call back the U.S. heads from diplomatic Masses in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama about the "obscientious Decisions of Not to Admit Taiwan", said Heather Nautert, the department spokesman, earlier of the year in a declaration.
But fines were considered only against El Salvador, who in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid, including drug control, development, and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference and focused on security and economic progress to follow a similar convention last year which was considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-Septem, top administrative officials had made it clear that they wanted the congress to continue effectively bringing an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address the congress, now scheduled for mid-Oktober, as a sign of the seriousness of the assembly for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A white-house spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal confidential talk on the condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an out-animist who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that could happen may be the special confidential talk about Robert Mueller’s report about Mr. Trump’s possible cross - bombing of the law, of which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also thought to focus on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia worked in the country’s attack on our elections.
If Congress were to go into other hands, Mr. Trump must face responsibility in that body, just when he was preparing to go before the voters again, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peer group.
It's a lot of axes, and with that I don't want to suggest that Mr. Torump's fall is inevitable-- neither that of its counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched out.
In 1938 German officials were ready to perform a coup against Hitler, if the West had only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia-Slowake at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such twists and democracy’s relentless course is being speeded or delayed.
Americans now face several such turns.
What will we do if Mr. Trump associate attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he had proposed secretly to take up the president and speculate about it last year whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times’s report is inaccurate.
"How shall we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair-- or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And above all, would we vote in the interselecting voice for a congress that would hold Mr. Trump answerable?
If we were to watch those tests, there lay a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi rule who at one time lived in my ambassadors house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to go and light Sabbath materials on that table carrying the swastika.
With this as my origin, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rankers' Graham Dorrans optimistically before Rapid Vienna's battle.
Rangers play Thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory over the Austrians will put them in a strong position to qualify for group G of Europe League by Villarreal earlier.
A union has prevented middle-field player Graham Dorrans from making its first appearance of the season to the 2-2 equalization against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this outcome as a springboard for larger things.
"It was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered into the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away there with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but a draw is probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another great European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it'll be a difficult game, because they had a good outcome in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can press through and get a positive outcome.
Last year certainly was difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a feel factor in the place.
The group is good, and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can now press through, sit behind us last season, and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this retirement savings fear.
Despite the fact that surveyers have a clear idea of how they want to be looked after, few people speak to their relatives about it.
About half the individuals in the Nationwide Study said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said that they talked to their children about it.
"People want a relative to care for them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes long in advance.
Working with your adviser and your family to preach where and how to receive care, since those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding decisions for long - term care may include a traditional long - term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self - insurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut down legal battles at the pace.
Place a health care force so that you assign a trusted individual to supervise your medical care and ensure that experts comply with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also consider arbitrary for your finances.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incompetent.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is heading to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details in a written plan so you are ready.
"It isn't just the financial issues which are involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, said officials, and it is expected that the death toll will rise.
With communication put out of action, relief officials could not get any information from Dongala Regentship, an area north of Palu closer to the center of the 7.5 range of tremors.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the CentralSulawesi Province, situated on the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regent stretching along more than 300 miles (180 km) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The rightship, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated 299,200 population in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the CentralSulavesi Province’s economy, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times during the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck west-Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific’s Ring of Fire and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A great quake along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26, which led to a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulted in 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong tremors hit the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 range struck the south of Java, Indonesia was most populated island, resulting in a tsunami that struck the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 range of quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 range of quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, leading to a tsunami of up to 30 feet [10 m] that destroyed dozens of towns and resulted in about 300 deaths.
2016: A Level quake hit Pidie Jaya Regentship in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly tremor and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't this time lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 died from buildings that crashed,
2018: Great tremors hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, with over 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-presided candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took off a female acquaintance’s phone when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Facilation facility and is held on a $500 unexplored sponsor, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pronounced "innocent, definitely" when asked what he was pleading, the network reported.
Patlin stared at three class A offences in the face, which means he could be locked up for a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class of B trespass, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal complaint was laid against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of Alaska’s Veterane Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a gun while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his military service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake-sunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 range of earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks were put out of action with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu City when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death sentence for suspect in NYC interreur attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York Citytarreur attack that has killed eight people – a rare punishment which has not yet been performed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot neighbor truck to attack a bicycle road along West Sidehighway in Lower Manhattan to carry out pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov had killed the eight victims and given "meaning" serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intention of asking for capital punishment, lodged in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges carry possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury Saipov struck with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder on extortion, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in reorganized crime cases, and a charge of violence and ruining motor vehicles.
The attack called for "delightful planning and premeditation", said prosecutors, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "offright, fierce and perverts".
"Sayfullo Habibulelac Saipov has injury, damage and loss of the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferchi, Hernan Mendoza, and Alejanjadro Damian Pagnucco, made the general notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since then the Southern District of New York has prosecuted a capital case.
The accused Khalid Barnes was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being sentenced to a plot to spy out the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were tenderly introduced with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Oezbekoutan, demonstrated no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He mentioned to detectives that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov said the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching IIS-videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently on the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo-advokats representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the persecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than accept a debt recognition for life imprisonment with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned." Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGL FARGE should be placed in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize today's armed forces during a protest at the Tory Conference.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the "heat" of Eurosnitists – since one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he must be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbanker Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that by the time the UK would be out, if Mr. Farage Brexit secretary was.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to unite her deeply divided officers was pressed by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The premier struggles to keep her Chequers trade - trade plan on dreev amid attacks of Brexiters, Remainners, and EU.
Bondors insisted that she would push door in her attempt to make an agreement with Brussels in spite of the deadway – and European and Labor force to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the Run Mean Run Assembly in Solul that he wanted to say "Chequers" out of it.
He suggested that Mr. Farage have made a nobleman and the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
‘ If he had been in charge, by the time we would have been out,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: 'I'll get up for Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers out.'
He outlined his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone refused proposals that public opinion had changed since the 2016 occupation: ‘ The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain totally untrue.'
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: ‘ I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bombard the streets and make sure that we are chosen in the first place.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton beaked world title after team orders gave him his winning over Sebastian Vettel
It became evident the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercdes ’ team orders would play a major role in the race.
From pale position, Bottas had a good start and almost won Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two curves and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettle first entered the wells and left Hamilton to drive into the back of the bundle into traffic, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercdes found a round about later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved ahead to wheel-to-wheel action which the Ferrari driver had at least risk-freely seen left at risk of maintenance to a double-move to defend on the third corner.
Max Travel started from the back row from the spring schedule and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he held to his tires to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He came into the wells on the 44th round but could not speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a hard day, because all weekend Valtteri had done fantastically and was a real sir.
The team did extraordinary work to have one-two," said Hamilton.
It was extremely bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed at a convention Senator Diane Feinstein for her insistence that she had not licked Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing his Supreme Court of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in Western Narginia and did not directly address the evidence that Ford had given before the Senate Law Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate was that people were "well and rude and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has entered the Senate over the past few days, when you see the rage, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say 'o, I haven't done it.
I haven't done it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you lick?
Remember her answer... you licked the document--'o, o, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we lick it...No, we didn't lick it," he added, in a subsidiation of the Senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter stating the accusations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was previously leaked in September but Feinstein denied that the leakage had come down from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't lick her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not consider her denial good and commented during Saturday evening’s convention: "I tell you what."
Perhaps she hasn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Courtmen who are accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the democrats use the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the meanness, the inoffensity, they don't care who hurts them, who should drive them to get power and control," said the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Downer threw two objectives for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday’s Elite Legue’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning the counter contest 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-intended direction by rolls from Patrick Dyner and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownnie brought the home team equally before Dywier restored the Giants ’ direction.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee a draw before two Luke Lundvald Nielsen-meanings fastened their victory.
It was the third Elite Legue victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who had lost games first and when Friday evening, Dundee 2-1 in Belfast, won.
This was the fourth assembly of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Downer's openball came from a Kendall McFaul aid in the fourth minute on 3:35, with David Rutherford offering help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home crew back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownnie's equaler at 15:16.
Downer made sure the Giants were taking the lead until the first break when he threw his second purpose of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team had regrouped and Bourchard once again got them a draw with a power game target at 27:37.
Cownnie and Charles Corcoran were joining together to help Nielsen give Dundee the first lead in the game late in the second half, and he made sure of winning with his team’s fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who have now lost four of their last five matches are at home to Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered to be a hero after he died when he made sure that an airplane that carried hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people are dead and more are missing after a great earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are trapped in breaking downs in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues who had fled for their lives, however, 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that had grown heavily on Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained unmovable to make sure that the Batik Air flight was 6321, who was at that time on the runway, able to rise safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he came to the point of falling down.
He later died in the hospital.
Spokesman for Air Narvigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balykpapan in Kaliman to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter hit Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster - disposal agency that says that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll still increases, since many dead bodies are still under the ruins while many can't yet be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves reaching up to 20 feet [6 m] have rocked Palu who will keep a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, related Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarks are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, related CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross chases to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu Sunday and said to the country's military service: "I ask almaI of you to work day and night to complete each task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia had been struck by earthquakes in Lombok, killing over 550 people.
Micronesia Airplane crash: Air Niugini says that one man is missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline that handled a flight crashed into a Pacific sea in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they had earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they had not been able to account for a male passenger.
The airline said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane had landed near the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had shot past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come in very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to walk through mid - deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants had panicred and shouted and that he had acquired a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that ships working close to improving a quay also assisted people with a blowing boat with salvation to land back and forth before the plane sank in about 100 feet [100 m] of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that in the past two decades, 111 people have been killed in collapses of PNG-registered airlines, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analiste sets out timelines of evening that woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the re-recilation of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
V.S. Department of Justice-Analist Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell - phone records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old charged Quinton Tellis and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was together Chambers on the night of her death, which was indiction with his previous claims, reported The Clarin Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "kik, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another innovation is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls and contact information had been deleted from his phone.
"He certainly took her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was scheduled to begin his concluding leadings Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A Hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origin of political messages and the beginning of social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fuspirit and Common have seen a recent recycling in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
NY-siderjuff sue couple for having been fired after "rasistic" text
A New York-kinderjuff sues a couple for discriminating layoff after she received an incorrect message from the mother who complained that she was another black person.
The couple deny that they're racist and compare the contest with "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, aired her dismay when she found out that the new child conditioner, Gielle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first workday in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEE NÓG A BLACK PERSOON," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she twice sent it to me Maurice.
After she noticed her flater, an "uneasy" Plasco-Flaxman fired me Maurice and said that they were outgoing childhood watcher who was Africa-American, doing bad work and that she had rather expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day’s work and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the layoff and seeks damages to the sum of $350 a day for the six months, resident work for which she was first appointed, although this was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such things," she told the Post Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple struck back on the claims that they were racist, saying that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s employment and fear that they could not trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people,' related man Joel Plasco the Post.
"But would you put your children into the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even though it was a tube?
Your newborn?
Then now."
Plasco compared the matter to "expression" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to chase after such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do,' added the investment banker.
As the legal case continued, the court of public opinion was quick to bring the couple on social media and cut them for their conduct and logic.
A new letter revealed that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear wouldn't connect readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It is very entertaining that we know of Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been fervent if his job had been rejected. He was a BBC camera man before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's declaration after his death was last year "bittersweet".
About Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an apple-gay person," she said.
"But because Paddington was genuine for him, it was almost as if you had a child who had accomplished something: you're proud of them, even if it wasn't your job.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success kind of that way.
Though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the credit for Padding itself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good - bye to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got the call from Nad down to say that within the next two minutes she would die and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heartlam.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was closing off.
I just had to sit there waiting, knowingly that it all unfolds.
I couldn’t chirp or scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who by now was hurt for the loss of her daughter, accompanied by the other passengers on board the plane, did not appreciate the ordeal she had gone.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head dropped, and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sympathetic feeling for Nad on flight.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning women mail cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been mailing cards for a while on a Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people for support.
Me Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began to lead to depression and killed himself at 18 years of age.
"I want no parent to feel as I do every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lived in Lydney and said that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"All knew him for his smile.
They used to say that his smile lit up any room."
However, he gave up work before he died because he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother to be his own life.
Me Davis said, "I worry all the time that there'll be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence--you should speak."
Me Humphreys, who had been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the very worst point on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact or something with them."
She said she died very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It jerked a hole through the family.
It splits us apart.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is still certain as FBI examines
"I thought if we could actually get something as he had asked for--a timeless investigation which had no best case--we might bring some unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was falling "approved" under entrenched partisapon ontoone.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Their restraint is all because of timing.
The selections are gone only weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fare badly, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to have preferred to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush telephoners call to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met his wife Ashley through him and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has produced its report?
There will be a vote in the seam, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently seated.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come to at least 50 votes on the sea floor which Mike Pence, the vice president, will allow him to break a draw and confirm himself to the Supreme Court.
Northern Korea Overrunger Numbers ‘dal' under Kim
The number of North Korean crossings to South Korea has dropped since Kim Young-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislature.
Park Byeong-seug quoted data from the South’s unification cabinet and said that last year there were 1,127 eardrums - compared with 2.706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher rates asked by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The great majority of runaways from the North are finally offered SouthCorea citizens.
Seoul notes that more than 3,000 North Republicers have illegally run the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flight via China, which has the longest border with NorthCorea and is easier to cross than the highly protective militarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreans.
China considers the runaways rather than illegal immigrants than refugees and often patents them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South who are still technically at war with one another have significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for conversations centered around the strikes over the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Young-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear - free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Minister of State Ri Yong-ho blamed on Saturday US section for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will disarm one sidedigent ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN general meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "Tisteries", says he is incapable of serving on the Supreme Court.
House minority leader Nancy Pellosi called Supreme Court - style Brett Kavanaugh "Tyteries" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever acted like this, they would say 'histeries'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate-right Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening release, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times he almost shouted and spit while discussing his family and his secondary school years.
He also specifically frowned on Democrats on the committee and called the claims against him a "pleasant and coordinated character insident", reorganized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Demokrate won the majority in the House of Laer.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court where he's at present," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Ommad Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Act on Conscientious Care of Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative right.
In his support hearings, Kavanaugh passed questions as to whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's no time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘ it's not wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women should handle it.
It's a just deacon, months and years' wrath that cook over, and she can't get it out without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," said me Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who also said that she cried when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she would have said to the person she spoke to, "You might think I am sad because I cried.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for bridle because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early work in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with anonymous anger and being grabbed at my neck skin by an older woman--a cold driver whom I was somewhat afraid of--who dragged me into a poolal.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they've affected you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congress woman from Kolorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart in an out - of - wedlock relationship on a boat was called Monkey Business, and he had to leave the race, my Schroeder, severely frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snoudy and the Seven Dwinds."
Since it was late in the campaign, she was behind with find collections, so she vowed that she would not enter the race unless she had gathered $2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1. 000 would give her only $250.
"Do they think I get discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions--Thanks for the people who had supported her, frustrated with the system which made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than partsholes, and angry for sexism--that she had stitched.
You'd have thought I had a nervous crash,' recalled my Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex had been my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
How the US-Shina trade war may be good for Beijing.
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the struggle is far from over, a dispute between the countries may be in the long - term benefit to Beijing, say experts.
Donald Trump, US president, raised the first warning earlier this year by burdening important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most important emulation rolled in this week with new rates affecting $200 billion ( £150 billion) of the items and effectively burdened half the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing retaliated each time in goods and recently slapped three to ten percent fares on $60 billion’s U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the US shot for shot and the world's largest economy will not move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to give up requests, but to meet the US requests publicly would be too much of an embarrassment for Xi Jinning, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing correctly plays its cards, pressures on US Trade War over long - term China can be a positive support by lowering the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that could start an economic toll flight in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have known before," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant who focuses on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria ‘ ready for refugees to return, ’ says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the volunteer returns of refugees, calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by war for more than seven years.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moulem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions improve in the country.
"Today the situation at ground level is more stable and secure due to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore to normal the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return from refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the one - sided economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moulem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the flat - beaten land.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the invasion.
Europe Seals Ryder Cup Victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and won U.S. team with a final point of 16.5 by 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not yet won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn’s team gathered the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
US-steire Phil Mickelson, who had struggled for most of the tournament, had his T-hold in the water broken up at the par-3 16th hole and gave in his contest to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari was shining in all its rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players ever to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Spieth was blown out by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Usen from Denmark.
The player with the world’s highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A Veteran of eight Ryder cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament’s European winner of 25.5 career points at all times.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
So grateful to Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I am so glad, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help,' said an emotional Garcia to the European victory.
He hands over the torch to his landman John Ram, whose Sunday US-haolphlen Tiger Woods 2,MOD1 has won in single game.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.

There was time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.
We deleted.
Howth down for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PiBA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move forward.

You have to keep your hat slanted.
We're surpassed."
