Members of Welsh Assembly worry they're going to look 'like stupid ones'
There is consternation among some meeting members on the proposal to change title of AM'e to MWP'e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of all over the political spectrum fear that it can provoke a ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party says his group is concerned because "it with Twp and Pwp rhyme."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means dumb and pwp means feces.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says its group is "indigently" on the name change, but noted that it is a short speech leap from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of sot or fool.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter you.
The Assembly Commission, which currently designed legislation to institute the name changes, said, "The final decision on any descriptions of what is called Assembly members will, of course, be a case for the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Welsh meeting the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received ample support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As to the AM's title, the Commission Welsh Parliament elected Members of WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM'e seems to be representing alternatives, but the fight to get consensus may be a headache to the chairman, Elin Jones, who must present a law proposal on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the meeting's working, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM'e will get the last say in the question of what to call them when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country's name
Selectors are going to vote Sunday whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern California".
The popular destination was arranged in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been urging for some time that the name of his neighbor in the north represents a claim to his territory and has repeatedly objected to his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, opposing the popular destination on the name change, said that he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue, however, that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's get quiet because churches are struggling in Harlem.
"Historically, say the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Not one of the two is there today more."
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize in other ways these days," he said.
"Crories are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people go regularly."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from asset sales is not going to last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining havens.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and will therefore bring even closer even the day that these churches completely close, because most of the people moving into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropool - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black parish led by Honor. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to appoint or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the kailjon.
Revew. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the kailjon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the kailjon in July called it something else: "A culture treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first cariljon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger cariljon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What plays off at St. Martin's last few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the congregation's governing body, consisting of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "is going to try to pass the cost" to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of a lack of transparency from the diocese's side.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster diving in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured when he dived for lobsters on the first day of the lobster season in California, officials say.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encintas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends on Saturday morning for half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed up with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the thrill of a first lobster catch, but then he realized "that he was calling, 'I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His whole key leg was torn open," Hammel saw as he came out of the boy.
"I've called for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as criticism.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
Lifeguardkalt. Larry Giles said at a media counseling session that a shark was noted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his upper body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to check and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsburys plans expansion to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's say Boots, Superdback and Debenhams are fighting with department store-type beauty passages manned by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and houseware fall back, the larger beauty passages in 11 stores will be tested across the country and if it is a success was taken to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty occurs while supermarkets look for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury's says that it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will for the first time include trade names such as Revlon, Esssie, Twezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more place with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique competition series again so that the majority of products are fighter-friendly - something that all more younger buyers insist on.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop concessions will test in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croydon in South London the first week and a second to open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local convenience stores mean that supermarkets have to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsburys, said that the stores are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight with more services and non-food products against the discount stores Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's placed Argos purchase points in hundreds of stores and also launched a number of Habitat purchase points since it bought both these chains back two years, which, according to their groceries sales, strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsburys tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship was terminated after an argument on how the profit should be divided from the pharmacies within its shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold his 281 store of pharmacy business for £125m three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Postay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's trade director, said, "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty passages to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially-trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.
Our range of trading names is designed to meet every need and the tempting environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a compelling beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'raged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million agreement
Dragons Den star Peter Jones ran away 'raged' after TV awarder Holly Willoughby withdrew to a £11 million agreement with his lifestyle trade brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their housewear-and-convention trade name, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The This Morning host, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby angrily left Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing their lucrative lifestyle trade brand business - focusing on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV at the last moment.
Sources say that Jones was "raged" when TV's golden girl was worth up to £1.5 million Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - worth up to £5 million - means that she can no longer spend enough time on their housewear and accessory trade name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled according to consecrateds Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortuin.
While Willoughby, 37, on Instagram announces that she leaves Truly, Jones climbed on a jet and exchanged Britain for one of his vacation homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority at far.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the upcoming few decades.
Her decision to withdraw had absolutely stunned all concerned.
No one could believe Tuesday what was happening was so close to the introduction.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's stars that let the most money pour in, the firm can chase millions out of the bag due to the huge investment in products extending from pillows and candles to dress and home, and the possibility that its introduction may encounter even more delays.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones for ten years and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby prepared Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples vacation together and Jones own a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV-production firm.
Willoughby is going to become a brand-ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A Source near Jones said last night, "We will give no comment on his business matters."
Hard words 'and then we fall in love'
He mocked criticism he was going to get from the news media because he made a remark that some would consider "unpresident" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President give up Trump so much?
said Trump in his kamma-" news reader voice".
"I gave up nothing."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second encounter after Trump described their first talks in Singapore in June as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament burned up.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said Saturday, over three months after the June leaders' convention in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding response" of the US on North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the US continues with sanctions aimed at holding up the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic impact in his convention talk.
"We're progressing superbly with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim produced positive results - this ended rocket tests, helped free hostages, and caused the remainder of American soldiers to be brought back home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidental, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into 'this crowded arena, we'd have nearly 200 people just stand there," Trump said as he pointed to the crowd right before him.
tywave and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, killed hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign nongovernmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was announced, a prerequisite for catimising international aid.
"In many cases they were sadly very clear that they didn't ask for international help, making it a bit difficult," said me. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children are putting a team together to travel to Palu, it is not sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials add the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Given the earth tremor that Indonesia constantly endures, the country remains sadly poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunamish shelters were built in Aceh, it is not a common sight to other shorelines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warningirene in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning of strength.
It is challenging at best to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's paint exchanged infrastructure a core point of his election campaign and published grow-up money on roads and railways.
However, Mr. Joko's administration is met by funding shortages as he faces reelection next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of sloating sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim lakey accepted a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of ontheem such as Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons fought on the street.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premier League loss against Chelsea on Saturday for a purpose in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri listed for Sturridge when he was behind some 30 yearsward of the Chelsea goal and his team 1-0.
He typed the ball to the left before kicking far to the goal pole.
The attempt sailed high over the frame as it glided to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball burst over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create for myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and typed once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked."
Chelsea was at half-time 1-0 ahead after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goal kicker replayed in that playing space with a rear kick to Mateo Kovacic before constituting near the midfield and fitting into the Liverpool heroes.
Kovacic quickly received and cited in the midfield.
With a beautiful forward-shot, he then led for Hazard into the frame.
Hazard passed the defense and finished with a left-foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the far goal net.
Liverpool contends on Wednesday at 3 p.m. the battle against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stagio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in UEFA Europe League.
Dodal rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped under the debris of buildings that caused the earthquake, which struck on Friday at a range of 7.5, to collapse, causing surf from up to 20 feet, said the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.

Parliament's statuut of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit with ‘ rewrite of history' dispute
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Talibanlike destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "solence" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said, "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statute that the form of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The imagery of the English civil wars was neither ordered by Cromwell nor carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the representation of a figure many believe to be still anniversaryable.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate depiction, is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is firm is that the conflict of the mid 17th century has given shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Murdervark Versrew Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his from, "Yuan", was found with a torn artery with blood covered dead near a cage at the market in Liupanshiu in Guizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A Pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a swine farming in Xining of Qinghai Province, China on May 30, 2005.
He, according to reports Wednesday, traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring pig cage.
He said there was a large male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
A Forensic investigation according to the report confirmed that the 550-pound pig had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and torn," said the cousin, who was called on his side, "Wu", quoted the Guiyaang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that the man killed does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A Mark manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police were collecting evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are said to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although raar, cases of pigs attacking people have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pounds-vark pinned a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer of Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster".
"They're just playful.
They're picks, very curious... they're not bent on hurting you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Res of Hurricane Rosa is going to bring widespread heavy rain to southwestern US.
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood rains across northern Mexico and the southwestern US over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 m.p.u., a Category 1-orcaan from 5 a.m. eastern time, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough across the Pacific begins to take shape and move eastward to the west coast of the US. As Rosa on Monday approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will drive heavy tropical humidity north-wheres the southwestern US in.
Rosa will bring Monday rain from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico.
Then tropical moisture in response to the approaching trough will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous instant influences, waste flow, and possibly land spills in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
So much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
Dependent influences may be with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the distributed nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep - leafed raging rivers to touch, and thunderstorms will bring severe local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall total figures of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause minor waste flow and smooth driving courses.
This will be the region's first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will start to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the US as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central US is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, delaying summer hots will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern US October will start hot, with widespread 80s from the Southern Low Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City may reach 80 degrees Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance at above average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
Over 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the stirring testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who charged him with a sexual assault that reportedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political dead-point continued, with broadcasters interrupted regular programs for Friday's up-the-nipper-winning: an agreement achieved by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to perform a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Legal Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh felt her in drunkenness and tried to pull her clothes out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that this had not occurred.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other networks it showed, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people looking in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience the size of one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinions strongly supported hosts Kavanaugh' appointment, was all the networks in front of with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long trial, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS-where protesters yell at him when he tried to take an elevator to a Legal Committee on Friday morning.
He stood down a few minutes with beaten eyes while CNN was alive visually he was being spoken evil.
"I stand right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and went in front of the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say at the committee trial.
The cable and broadcasting networks all covered live hours later when the Legal Committee would vote around Kavanaugh's naming to the full Senate for a voice.
But Flake said that he would do so only with the understanding that the FBI would look at the allegations against the candidate for the next week, as the Democrat minority has requested.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump set an FBI investigation to the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of ‘political game' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, of "political playery" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives on September 29, 2018 for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview along the one with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, stating that a proposal that Britain and the EU should influence each other's fareer was "completely ridiculous."
Waye Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Waye Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second-graduate murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the struggle.
Police found the glasses back on the scene and said that they had found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS-defiled WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to killing Waye.
His bail was fixed at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The judicial autopsy office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued Friday a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound on the head in the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police' crime laboratory, Southern University police and areasburgers for their aid with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU atletics Director Joe Alleva resigns territory law application for his "riger and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six forecaster grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 back protests per game.
Friday morning LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team struck in"plash" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," Wayde said.
Volcano spits as on Mexico City
As that spitd out of the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and registered 183 releases from gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple chants and tremors.
Images on social media showed how thin layers of gas cover car wind screens in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geofici marked an increase in activity at the volcano, which sat 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since an earthquake with a range of 7.1 central-Mexiko in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalonian separatists before commemoration of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, joining thousands of counter protests to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's polaristing voice for foundation.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police threw them with eggs and threw powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually teem with tourists.
A steamery also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their clubs to control the fighting.
Over several hours pro-independence groups on one tone "No Forget, No Forgiveness" sang in confrontation with the unionists' scream of "Lank Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries suffered in the processions, reported the local press.
The tension continues to run high in the independenceist region a year after the October 1 referendum was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatis-Katalane.
Selectors voted overwhelmingly to become independent but the participation was low, with those against foundation who largely boycotted the voice.
According to Katalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried in violent clashes to prevent the polling at the voting locals across the region.
Pro-unafhanclability groups camped overnight Friday to prevent a protest in support of the national police.
The protest continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote but now we stuck," he said.
Despite a vital yet narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties have struggled this year to retain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-prosecuted exile or in detention in advance for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalonian leaders in pre-feding since late last year, announced that he was going to stand in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to approve the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car tying against home
Three men, 33, 34, and 39 years of age, were arrested after a car repeatedly drove against a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded on Thursday around 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Trace inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot to the car at a time.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures victory
Promotioned Livigston stunned Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was evidence of the difference when Gary Holt's team moved to second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remained in the Premiership that season without a run away and faced the precursors Heart, which they are eight points next week.
Rangers are first Thursday host for Rapid Vienna in the Europe League.
Meanwhile, Livingston expands their unimposed run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still not experiencing a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston play chances against bot visitors
Holt's team must have been running ahead long before they scored a goal, with their vagrantity coming upon Rangers all sorts of problems.
SR broke through, but carried in front of the goal cage, then AL could only play widely after approaching and met CH's headhold across the goal cage.
The hosts were content to have Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors with death pins.
And thus the decisive goal came.
Rangers lost a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson giving Menga the chance to kick and from the center of the frame a purpose.
By then Rangers had dominated possession but could not penetrate the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely carefree.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a blow of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow typed widely to avoid still open game of Livingston.
Over crosses repeatedly reached and repeatedly stopped Livingston's frame, while two penalties – after Halkett's challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball — were turned away.
‘Fenomenal' of Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and results for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still surpass expectations on this upward track.
Their game style and manship are almost unchanged since their return to first rank, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his magnificent defence arrangement as Menga held for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they could at times under Gerrard they could not uphold those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they could penetrate the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, which they find in middle division.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There were Saturday (29 September) smiles and blue sky when leaders from Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a fall over issues that include human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge large new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from meeting before the mosque but many supporters arrived afterward to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdies – also thicked their voices and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The warring demonstrations reflect the divisions of a visitor greeted as a hero by some German Turks and is passed out by others as an autocrat.
Deptford road accident: Bicyclinger dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision took place around 10:15 BST near the closure of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in southeastern the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-rap in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working on identifying the man and informing his close relatives.
Road closures and bus bypasss were advised to avoid the area in place and motorists.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Watchers in riot injured
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high security man's prison, the prisoner office said.
Oproer broke out on Sunday around 09:30 BST and is still going on at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialis-"Tornadokeepers" were called in to deal with the riot, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor face injuries.
A prison service spokesman said, "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to pay attention to an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay longer behind bars."
HMP Long Martin hosts over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the chief warden of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year rioters were called in to pay attention to serious disorder during which staff with billiard balls were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa Drieig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitefements (Drogte Areas Draw May Benefit)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure hit Arizona but it's exactly what may happen early next week if Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert and brings instant influence risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued instant influence carts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and by Monday will bring near with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a twiet that only "ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Come, will likely get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those out of instant influence risk, Rosa's rain is likely to be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest currently experiencing drought.
According to the US Drying monitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Orkaan leads Rosa's way to approaching land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, so her power decreases.
So it is expected that she will reach the country Monday in the afternoon or evening at tropical storm strength in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Renvaltotals from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression Tuesday in the early morning hours and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah at late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the US Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to cause life - threatening instant influences and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds were found in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found on Saturday at about 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to hospital where he was still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials appealed to anyone who may have any cell - phone imaging material of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'gely has under the commonity, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "faired under the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified on Thursday before Congress and emotionally denied a claim of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her claim during the trial.
The President said Saturday the Americans saw "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skilled legal spirits of our time, a juris with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd West Virginia supporters.
The president alluded to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican rise at the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I don't stand, but actually I stand," he said.
That's why I fight all over for these candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "oppose and obstruct."
The first important procedure votes on the Senate floor over Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds killed due to Indonesian tremor, tsunami, with figures still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday for a festival on the beach when waves broke from up to 20 feet (18 m) high at sunset on the beach, washed many away after their death, and destroyed all that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 range of earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges that were distorted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Naskocks still shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's agency for the evaluations and application of technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday's huge tremor was about 200 times the force of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have aggravated the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage may be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala closer to the earthquake haird.
Communication "was completely hampered with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there, said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not telling that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had come at the time issued the warning.
In amateur sculpture shared on social media, it can be heard how a man on the upper floor of a building cries desperate warnings about the emerging tsunami at the people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and bad buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to explain the image material authentic immediately.
The quake and tsunami caused major power outages that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but artisans still have food and other basic necessities needed.
The city's airport was reopened only for assistive efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit Sunday evacuation centers in Palu.
Indonesia tunami death rates rise above 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision's staff of Donggala arrived safely in Palu City where employees sheltered in deck shelters set up in their office's courtyard, they passed on their way at scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even as assistance groups begin the horrible task of triggering the disaster relief job, some people complained that foreign aid workers were being prevented with much experience from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and staff from overseas can only get under way after the area of the disaster has been declared national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"This is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aubia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "OK, it's a national disaster," we can open it to international assistance, but it doesn't yet have a status."
With the arrival of the second evening on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a sewer pipe.
Sunday, rescuers saved a woman for two days under rubble was stuck with her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachute glider team has trained two of the missing parachute winners for the Asian Games that once ended demonth in Indonesia.
Still some of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachute glider field I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated on social media below the parachute glider community, he sent despairing WhatsApp messages to the Palu partners participating in the beach festival.
However, his messages were only answered with one grey legal brand, instead of two blue legal brands.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during refill of OTM at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 at a Brinks worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a news statement from the Newport Police Station.
The car's driver was emptying an OTM in an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While busy, another man came running "from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities must contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Ripper changes his name to Ye
Ripper Kanye West is going to change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote, "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has for some time been nicknamed Ye and has used the nickname as the title for its eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live where it is expected that he will introduce his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that cancelled for "emotional reasons", said the program's producer.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Yes – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known among others as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy of Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has also finished with or without a link sign and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military against civilians
Mexican pass-elective President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has gone on to promise the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students never to use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday to "never use the military to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left-minded student movements developed throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities attract youth to gangs.
US must double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US has to double the amount that it spends on research in that field, investor and AI-practisyn Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The comments come after several parts of the US government have made AI announcements, even if shortly the US is making a total formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China has announced their plan: they aim to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Dubbel the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
The doubleing of funding can double the odds that the next major AI feat will be achieved in the US, Lee vandeesweek said in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" surnamed by Hoghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system beating the highest approved U.S. Othello player and later he was a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions of the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one was going to be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders away; it's the corporate dors," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influential individuals from other universities to work on AI in the past years.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to assist the US AI efforts.
"I think green charts should be offered automatic to PhD's in AI," he said.
China State Council issued their Next Generation Development Plan for Artistic Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a joint centre for artificial intelligence intended to involve partners from the industry and the academic world and the White House announced the formation of a approval committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, VS legislation intended to create a National Security Commission on Artistic Intelligence came under the fire months of last.
Macedonians vote in election or country's name must change
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum about whether to change their name to "Republic of Northern Mexico", action that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece blocking its membership bots for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that their northern neighboring country's name represents a demand in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents reasoned that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has sown doubts about whether the rise will meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question of the referendum ballot read, "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argued that it is a price that can be paid to pursue admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that came into existence from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MPs have said that they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The name change will require a second-star emerity in parliament.
The state's election commission said there were no reports of unrest by 1 p.m.
However, the attendance was then only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote as a result of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko bring out their voices for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country's name which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Stratica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Prior to the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small verhogie and drew chairs in front of tents set up by those who go to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads raised, not by the back door" Kavadarkov said.
"We're a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe the great majority will be in favor of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after bringing out his voice.
He said a "yes" outcome would be "a confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute of Policy Research stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum — less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, attendance must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A return in the referendum will be the first serious setback for the policy of a pro-Wester government since the government took over last year in May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates throughout Brighton defence for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goal kicker received a report at midfield at the beginning of the series.
He raced through between three Brighton editings before hitting the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed by one defender before passing several more on the edge of the Brighton goal cage.
He then pushed a record to the left, where he found for Sterling.
The English forecaster used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back for Aguero, which used his right foot to beat the Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick into the right side of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League Acquire.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area at that game.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some contacts before leading Sterling to the far goal corner.
The Sky Blues' forecaster kicked the ball in the net just before he was over the back line.
City tackle Hoffenheim in Champion League Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play tricker against Rockies
With the Nationals being out of the playoffs, there is little reason to force down another start.
But the ever-compending Scherzer wants to embrace the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still play-playing implications for the Rockies, which have a one match-prospang above the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies achieved at least a promoter selection place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still want to capture their first division title.
"Although we don't play for anything, we can at least play the game knowingly that the atmosphere here in Denver will likely be facing the crowd and the other team at the highest level of any point of me this year.
Why would I not want to participate in it?".
The Nationals still have to announce their starting player for Sunday, but are reported to be favorable to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th start, had a throw-training session Thursday and will play on his normal rest-Sunday.
The Washington right-handed is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outhals in 220 2/3 take turns this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court selection Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican rise at the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
It's one of the big, big – I don't stand, but I actually stand and that's why I fight all over for these candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "One sees this horrible, horrible radical group Democrats, one sees it happening now.
And they are now determined to take back the power by using any possible way, one sees the meanness, the genius.
They don't mind who they hurt, about whom they must walk to get power and control, that's what they want, power and strength, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, is on a mission to "stand and obstruct."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "ang and mean and geniusy perception and false".
He was referring on the name to Senate's judicial committee's high ranking Diane Feinstein, who received hard cheer from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Have you got the document leaked?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant of those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to put me under censorship, it was not exactly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of Labour Party LPs who was told we're not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she bravely stood up against anti-semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironic enough similar issues over which Jeremy differed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party LP, it was exactly what Friday night's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of "friendly, more gracious" politics has long since been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party's leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I thought I had shared similar political views before began expecting me to make a U turn and take in positions I would never otherwise agree with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there follows a tirade of abusive speech on social media that asks me not to be re-elected, disapproval of politics from the core, and to tell me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed to me are political.
I have a lot of respect for the professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalised.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules the party becomes enger.
For the past two years, I have had much advice that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so outspoken, and that I will then be "oldui".
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since joining the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused at all about my policies and areas where I disagree with the present leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country heading on a Brexit that is going to harm all households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Labour Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my voters, or they are members of the Labour Party even now: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats from not being re-elected or political advantage will hold me back from doing what I believe in you's best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unalated Ayr above
Two late threes may have gone slightly wrong with the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned to triumph in this wonderful-making Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the score, the only unintended team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chance, which carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie has all right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still unimpressed, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, intended by Frazier Climo, made Ayr before, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to have the numbers numbered and Jason Baggot scored an unintended three.
Climo enlarged Ayr's lead with a penalty kick, just before he, just before rest time intended a solorite to make it rest time 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's three, intended by Baggot, reduced the back to five points.
There was a long intention for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott being carried down on a stretcher, and from the reboot, Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, intended by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unintended three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of much pressure game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he took to death for Climo without the ball, and stood from the penalty line MacPherson to death the ball behind the emerging Ayr board meal.
Climo had intended this, just like he had also done almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's goal kick and flanked Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth three.

'The sea is ours': land ringed Bolivia hopes court will reopen away to Pacific
Matrose patrols a mastworked naval quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Navalbases from Titicaca More to the Amazon are with muttered with the slogan, "The sea is to law ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the surveyed Bolivia, the memory of the coastline is what they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, still fresh – nest the need to ply the Pacific again.
That hope is probably the highest it was in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a verdict by the international court of law on October 1, after 5 years of talks.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peaceableness, and obviously expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look the IGH verdict on major screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia's claim that – after decades of spadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president – facing a controversial battle for re-election next year – also has much that depends on Monday's pronunciation.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia's favor – and that few will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's pronunciation comes only six months after the last bets shows that the case was "not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than assist Bolivia’s case, it may have delayed in the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea was hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric caused any remaining Chilean sympathy, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talks again at one point, but it will be extremely difficult to conduct nadish talks.
The two countries last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision making was unusually fast.
Monday, Bolivia will bring "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationships with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of differences with betting benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the navigation issue as a political crank.
Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless they can trust US
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country will never disarm their nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri was at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the rival countries' leaders.
His remarks follow VS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo evidently on the edge to restart nuclear diplomat, which has reached a dead point, more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Young Un.
Ri says it is a "drome image" that continued sanctions and US captain to a statement ending the Korean War will also bring the North on its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the statement without Pyongyang taking first significant steps to disarmament.
Both Kim and VS President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about relinquishing an arsenal that the country considers to be the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest series of large head coverings en route to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or totally turn away from the sun, you don't have to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of silly oversized head coverings at their SS19 collection on the walkboard that enchanted the style at Paris Modeweek.
Extremely impractical hats have permeated this summer Instagram, and these designers have paraded their mind - inspiring creations on the walkboard.
The excelr by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feathery wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included melons decorated with jewels, a magician hat, and even a pineapple – but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like scuba equipment, with a snorkel and diveglasses included, while another looked like a molten ice cream croak.
And if you continue the great fashion, it's your happy day.
Style viewers predict that the huge hats may be on their way to the shops near you.
The oversized hats follow closely on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide edge seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread across social, sent another great creation over the walkboard – a straw-stax bag almost as large as the swimming pants model that carried it.
The burned orange raffiasak, finished with raffiafrains and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Rivera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags appearing in stores for next summer – since the designer has made such a major impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessives.'
John Edward: Language skills essential to world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a ride of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which were only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community businesses.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher training, their chosen career and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable vocational choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest passing rates in independent schools.
A Total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher degree A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 membership schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher degree A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those studying French, and 63 of those studying Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now, as a subject selection, have the same prestige as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Calls and Skills found in 2014 that some of the reasons employees provide why they struggle to fill posts are attributed 17 percent to a shortage of language skills.
Therefore, language skills become increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a believedballized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, automatically puts a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to converse and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why investing in today’s children’s language education is so important now.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered essential to the UK when looking ahead at 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching personnel being specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be perceived at this point, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, so it must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages must truly be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland's young people.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeSource will make Sunday debut for San Diego Lakers
The guard is almost over for fans to see LeSource James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But exactly how many minutes he's gonna play yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell has wied that James will probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier surname week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the preseason program.
"I don't need preseason games at this point to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight A wave of election events in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies in the following week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation voice currently held back for its choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming intermediate election because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voted in November.
How late is Trump's rally in Western Virginia tonight and how does one watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can look below via live current at Trump's rally in Western Virginia.
Trump will likely give attention to this week's trials for the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, which became tense over accusations of sexual misconduct with a expected confirmation vote held back for up to a week while the FBI was investigating.
But the main point of view of this excess is to help the Republicans facing difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus stated that these five co-operations were aimed in the following week to "call on volunteers and supporters while Republicans were trying to protect and enlarge the majority they had in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control over Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused his name to be called, told Reuters.
This evening's rally, arranged for the Westanco arena in Wheeling, can pull supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time the past month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, which is behind, according to the voice patterns.
"It's not for Morrisey a good sign that the president must come to give him a boost at the polling bus," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The team of the U.S. shows that they have courage for the struggle to keep the hope alive when they enter Sunday's single game
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon four-game teams may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of momentum is an overallly contrived sports concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions like that.
So where would they say that the momentum is now?
"They have run ahead with six points and now it's four, so we wear it as a bit of momentum, I count," Jordan Speth said when he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead and another twelve being played.
However, the Americans feel, as Spith says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is a lot to encourage them, not the least the class of Speth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points from four.
Spieth was lethal from the bid to the cleanfield and led by his example.
Those suspension celebrations became harder as she advanced round and he sank a critical stipul to win match four completely even while he and Thomas were behind two rounds.
His sethou who won the game at 15 for them was greeted with a similar scream, the sort that tells a man that he believes that the American team has another chance.
"You really just have to take out everything and worry about your own game," Speth said.
That's all those players have left now.
18 wells to dismiss their imprint.
The only players who have more points than Speth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the untiring story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's couples but charming couple got four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who did not record one hold over track rate on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one blow over track rate on Saturday morning as well as during the rear nine Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this exuberant crowd, confirm that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood of Molinari who can close a potential European victory when the sun descends over Le Golf National.
Electionly both simultaneously or at different wells.
However, it is still too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One held over track rate and two doubles on the front nine put the Spaniard and the Sweed into a hole from which they could not even come.
Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and four-play teams are so exciting to watch from close because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can turn into a flash.
Europe has always played better as a team so far and has spearheaded significantly on the last day, but this four-game session also showed that the team of the US has the courage for the fight that some, particularly at home, have doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 before during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and four-game games with a head of 10-6.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tries to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, has an American team that presupposes unevenly in the morning's fourballs, so that they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. has more resisted in the four-games and has won two games, but they do not shrink the back.
Jim Furich's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newling to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup that scored four points after their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they played superbly together to conquer a pap Woods and American newling Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's fourballs, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koupka - which is first and third on the world ranking.
However, Europe did not always get their way on a pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spith who won a major tournament three times and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They scored a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four games after losing the first two wells.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a backfire of four points when entering the single game, even though Furich's team only has to play a draw to retain the trophy because they already like it.
However, after being second best for two days, they do not seem to succeed a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they'll 'resolutely not disarm' one-sydig without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions worsen their distrust of the United States and that the country is sure not going to give up its nuclear weapons onesyly without such characteristics.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea has struck "meaning goodwill measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We see, however, no corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we shall certainly not disarm ourselves one-sy first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "prised" approach to removal of nuclear weapons whereby taking gradual action would reward North Korea, his words seemed significant in that it did not reject one-sided removal of nuclear weapons unconditionally as Pjongjang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a president of the U.S. and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's safety.
North Korea wants a formal end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pjongjang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests to relax strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by intensifying the level of the sanctions to achieve their purpose in a compelling way, and even objecting to the 'explication of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions worsen our distrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader had called attention to the United Nations earlier in the week.
Rather, the minister focused on three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in and added: "If the party were in this issue over destruction of nuclear weapons South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead point."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different than last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be directed to the US country mass after "Mr. Evil President" called Kim a "fire rocketman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened last year to destroy North Korea "complete," Kim praised abundantly for his courage for taking steps to disarm, but he said that much work is still to be done and that sanctions still need to remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
Wednesday, Trump said that he didn't have a time frame for this, saying "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia hold that the UN Security Council must reward Pjongjang for the steps they have taken.
But, the U.S. Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council Thursday that: "Application of sanctions by the Security Council must go on diligently and without ceasing until we reimpose the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to raise funding for Pjongjang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and afterwards said that he would visit Pjongjang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there has not gone well.
He left Pjongjang in July and said that progress was made, but North Korea accused him of setting "bendish demands" just hours later.
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon to break down a missileist and also took a nuclear complex as the United States "consisting measures."
He said that Kim told him that the "responding measures" he wanted to see were security sponsors promising Trump in Singapore as well as steps towards normization of relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course over enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year lates all of its pregraduate students get more sleep in an attempt to counter the growing machi culture of study by cafefien driven 'whole night sessions'.
An academic found that students at the world's top University are often ignorant when it comes to the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one has ever told her how important sleep is - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, presented for the first time that year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to take the course after it was found that students had been taken seriously sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves some interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a sleeping hall, where students should click on coffee cups, curtains, practice shoes, and books to be told about the effects of cafein and light and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficit and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think of their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of pride to study 'whole night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever growing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation to be a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even avoiding putting weight on, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after walking one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened its eyes and inspired him to campaign for a campuswide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all undergraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disturb your circadian rhythm and lead you to have trouble touching the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Purpose of Menga conquers Gerrard's men
Rangers experienced another sarsie off-day heart when Dolly Menga's goal kick Steven Gerrard's inerigious team gave a defeat of 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to score their first win as visitors since February's 4-1-sage at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only administered to Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, running loose hands in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before rest time, and it didn't seem that a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be further trouble ahead for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the way.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that rushed past Ayr to the finals of the Bethfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been in his nopices with the way his well-trained team had smothered their opponents at each turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball ownership, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They should have scored after just two minutes when Menga's first depressing Scott Pittman passed through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfield player pulled his big chance open.
A deep free kick by Keanghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense mate Alan Lithgow could only kick dung at the rear goal pole.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have received a penalty goal at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but the referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulily's head shot and a tame goal kick of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener at the 34th minute may have been towards game, no one can deny that they earned it, even though it is only for their hard work.
Rangers once again did not handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained coolhead and sent it to Menga for a simple finishing.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulbaly for Ryan Kent and had the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but raced the impressive Kelly from his streak to the block.
However, Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett placing long ball after long ball.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come in wide from the corner point.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a penalty kick when he became confused with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from our "Sunday morning" almanak: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE ET TURT ... the day on which future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geigerteller.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a support of science, and it has also become a pillar in pop culture, as played in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geigerteller used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these earphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Goutists, it's cracking about now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' robber cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill robber cells
Ent dust teaches immune system to identify robber cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawal from immune cells from a patient, changing them in a laboratory
They can then 'see' a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify robber cells, saw her oval cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves withdrawal from immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein found in many cancers and call HER2, and then injecting the cells in again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US national cancer institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drivens the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, oval, lung and coloretal cancer, explained Prof Berzovsky.
A similar approach to remove immune cells from patients and "learning" how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West began a pro-Trump mockery after his actions on SNL, while wearing an MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was expelled in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a protracted action in which he praised US President Donald Trump, saying that he would preferable in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town and during which he wore a Make America Greatpet, he set sail against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I speak so often to a white man and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a breedist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not broadcast, the image material of West's slam was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear that Rock tried to mock West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it was made difficult for him behind the stage for what he was carrying on his head.
"They cheered me behind the stage.
They said, 'don't go out with that hat on.'
They cheered me up!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West went ahead, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would "dress his sucker manmantel, because that means you can't tell me what I should do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comment at least twice evoked an outjoury at the audience and members of the SNL role division seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there saying to the publication, "The whole studio became silent."
West was brought in as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rhymeleter Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised by an execution of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who had wimmed: "To one of the most courageous spirits: DESPITE THAT YOU WOND ON THE SKARS."
But chatpprogramgaswoman Karen Hunter has wished that West simply "was who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I've chosen to reward somebody NOT (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") which I believe accepts an ideology and proclaims what endangers my community.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Prior to the show, the rhymeler announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the being once known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellowry-mkletser, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-turning role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereo type of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel the need to be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from Game or Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'reasonablely strong' about dealing with this issue.
'I personally feel pretty strongly about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with masculinity?', he said.
'What have we taught men as they grow up with regard to the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity due to its extremely male characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what has been taught?
What is taught on the TV and in the streets that make young boys feel that they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time--how do we change it?
Because something evidently went wrong with our young men.'
in the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones-purpose and-references when the series came to an end next summer, for he says he is 'explained with battlefields and horses'.
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married on the premises of Leslie's family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, representing a change of the past.
Traditionally, HIV quickly spreads through some parts of China as a result of induced blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has risen by 100,000 people.
HIV transfer by sex is a critical case in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was demetricized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transfers of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to make a job.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has let GOP senators' data leak out, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'constituency theories'
US Republican Maxine Waters railed on claims on Saturday that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican US senators on the legislatures' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were driven by "ultrarights" experts and websites.
"Leuens, lying and still detestable lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for US- Sens. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel's trial on the claims of sexual misconduct against the nominee for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the placements were related to Waters' office and had introduced the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is utterly untrue and an absolute lie," Wanders continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were put at risk due to this deceitful and false claim - was by no means responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless claim is utterly untrue and an absolute lie."
Wanders' statement soon drew online criticism, including former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and quiet."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of appearing to be too angry during Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to lift Waters in the interelection from the pillows, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he hoisted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office "has informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these deceptive claims.
"We will make sure that the plegers are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally accountable for everything they do that is destroyed and dangerous for every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Against review - faint Rowan Atkinson spying
It is now traditional to look for Brexit significance in any new film with a British infringement and it seems applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy ridicule franchise - which started with Johnny English in 2003 and continued struggling with Johnny Englishborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-chos even atire on the subject of how obvious power we are be the nation's new export event?
In any event, the unholpe Johnny English with his vocal eyes and rubber face had his license to make everything waste up for the second time renew - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a major comic creation for non-English-speaking movie audiences.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre amusement to sophisticated elegancy, has a little bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean and a good skeut of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire theme song at the openigs ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveller and international man of puzzles, leaving chaos behind him, who played Atkinson at once in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two cute moments in this latest version of JE.
I liked Johnny English who went to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armory and cut the screwsheets briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display but the humour feels pretty faint and peculiarly superfluous, especially when the "serious" film trade brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now itself is using comedy with confidence as an ingredient.
The humour feels as if it is aimed at children rather than on adults, and to me Johnny is English's misfortune is not as original and focused as Atkinson's silent movie chips in the pressona of Bean.
The everlasting techatic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A Cubercracker infiltrated Britain's supersecret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent to service - a lamentable small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a puffed up and besieged character, who is already experiencing a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson does her utmost with this quasi-Tresa May character but there is but little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since each active spy has been endangered, she should call someone out of his retirement.
And this means the struggling Johnny English himself, now in service as a teacher at some fancy institution, but giving lessons from the record on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency commission and is reunited with his former long - suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an alamapstics role in which too little is expected of Viki Pipperdine.
So the Batman and Robin are from wasting everything completely in Her Majesty's secret service completely again on service and come down on Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister ends up under the dangerous charm of the charismatic technology billionaire claiming to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant, causing them chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury sail hunting; and English lets loose sheer anarchy when he tries to use a single spot for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene, nothing is spared, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite much like children-TV.
Fair middle.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking: can the British not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to its right?
Labor denies that it devises a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a drastic plan that will cause British to work a four-day week - but be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants company bosses savings caused by the artificial intelligence (KI) revolution to be transferred to workers by giving them off extra day.
This will make workers enjoy a three-day weekend - but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that it will 'pass' at the party's economic agenda and plans to introduce the country into the favour of the workers.
Changing to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to utilize the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party Source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day week is a ambition that fits into the party's approach to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker as well as at the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day week during its campaign for the general election in 2017.
The ambition, however, is currently not endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said, 'A four-day week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow minister John McDonnell used last week's Labours conference to elaborate on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'faceless Directors' and 'winners' at service businesses.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not regain their entire investment as a Labour government can make 'offs' based on alleged offense.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on directors of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of elevity in businesses in the private sector to employees, who can get annual dividends from up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a final vote on his nominee to the Supreme Court delayed by at least a week and raises the question whether the bureau's findings can convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked for Republican sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could make anything change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Did you do it?
He was determined, definitely, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be inalienable.
"I have formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett zealously denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she calls could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I see nothing new changes."
What is the World Citizen Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that act and have an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizen Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will stream to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy actions not only by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to create awareness for the occasion's real purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Peace Project, an international advocate group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the occasion (unless you are willing to pay for a BBP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as doing volunteer work, send an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call, or any other significant way of creating awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years remaining to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "theitivisms" - people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a twiet?
Since 2011, World Citizen has said it has recorded over 19 million "actions" of its supporters, supporting a host of different goals.
It says that these actions helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that would potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, at least $10 billion of which were already paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementrs committed to "helping children reach their full potential", promising to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after getting more than 4,700 twcy of World Citizens.
"With support from the government of the UK, donors, national governments and World Citizens just like you, we can let the social injustice of malnutrition become a footnote in history," the Power of Nutrition-ambasssador Tracty Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions done to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the general questions on his website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
World Citizen responded, "It'll be a long and hard road - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-aparty movements before us, we will be successful, because we have more strength together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monnae are among the artists who act in New York at this year's event, which will be offered by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use fleet for "blockade" to stop export of Russian energy - Minister of the Interior
"Indian" may leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from getting into the market, including in the Middle East, the US Minister of Internal Affairs has revealed Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular where it works on invitation from the legal government - is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to an officer, there are ways and means to tackle them.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not end up on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of an event offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit hunting that considers themselves the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that it is practical the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said while referring to Russia as a "singletainer" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The pronouncements come as Trump administration was on a mission to boost the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, at far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officers, including America's President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unpassed" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump Berlin, makes Moscow's "prisoned".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition of the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means to carry out pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, to a meeting with America's Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The US's view provoked counter response from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's prominent organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) appealed to the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the blateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellier Angela Merel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "earnestly consider it" to stand as president in 2020, said the Senator of Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday she would "earnestly consider" standing as president after the mid-term elections.
During a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and it includes a woman on the highest sport," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6 I will seriously consider standing for president."
Warren aired her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town meeting and said he "takes the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm inwardly worried about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a twiet Friday, Warren said "naturally we need an FBI investigation before our vote."
A survey released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think that she should stand in 2020.
Eight-five percent of "probably" Massachusetts selectors said the senator shouldn't stand, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Two-and-thirty percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor should stand Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting the idea of having to stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed to possibly stand in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son is passing through, what he is passing through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who sense the effects of PTSV and the wound with which our soldiers return," she told an audience during a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the departure" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and air force members and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assault of a woman, interference with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a gun while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge of a new US policy refusing asylum to victims fleeing gang or household violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-off law commission Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions event that the American Civil Liberties Union filed against the federal policy in August was not made public.
She says her mate "and his violent gang member boys," abused her, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, producing a large number of applicants for US album, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new USisation policy reversed a decision in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Apples (Raad of Immigrantsappèlle) that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia's Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy "discades' state, federal and international laws ignores."
"Federal laws require that all asion searchs be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the demand, and such advocacy violate that policy," said the friend-of-the-off law commission.
Attorneys went on to argue in the legal command that the policy that immigrants refuse access harms the US economy and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "inquiry labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions commissioned immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing because of domestic and gang violence.
"Asil is available to those who leave their native country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
asylum was never intended to alleviate all problems — even all serious problems — facing people around the world every day.
Wanthrop rescue efforts in Palu while death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly nipend.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while comforting her fevery baby boy at an evacuation center in the battered city of Palu.
"Every minute brings an ambulance bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen returning to their ruined homes, searching through saturated possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 range of tremors, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's army hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-story hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There wasn't time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the walls' debris, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
VS-ambassador accuses China of 'afcousy' with 'probidence-ad-detention'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper praising the mutual benefits of V.S-China trade, the US-ambasssador accused China Beijing of the use of the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
VS- President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily's paid inset in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa's newspaper with most sales – after accusing China of interfering with the US Congress elections of November 6, a complaint that denies China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections has marked what US officials told Reuters is a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to put ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalative trade war that has led them to level tarive rounds on each other's imports.
China's retribution rates early in the trade war had a goal of hitting performers in states such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branch City, the USambassador for China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branch City in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "thirred now the bullying by publishing propaganda advertising in our own free press."
"By placing the spread of their propaganda, the Chinese government grabs America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, one will find at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing very limited dissenting votes and not see any true reflection of the diverse opinions the Chinese people have on China's alarming economic trajek, that media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers shrank away from the offer to publish his article", although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women's selectors before inter-elections with Kavanaugh debakel, warns analysts
While many top-Repubans stand at Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of several claims of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see reaction during the upcoming intermediate elections, especially of women.
The emotions about this run enormously high, and most Republicans are on record that they already indicate they want to continue with the vote.
Those things can't be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s approach for an FBI investigation on the last minute will be enough to appease severe voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning protesters "November is on the way!" roaring as they protested in the entrance portal of the Senate while the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee to continue with Kavanaugh's naming despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the newsyard.
"People say it was already high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially under swing voice-womanly voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't frequently vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony which outlines the details of her accusation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominated, analysts said a counter response can follow if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
"It became a messing mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's voice or the final voice and whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," pointed Guy Cecil, director of Primary USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, to the news channel.
But Americans look slightly divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more taking the latter's side.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are determined or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say that they definitely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or definitely cranked during his testimony, while only 30 percent had said the same about Ford.
After Flake's approach, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainer, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate's Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at the age of 17. while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-nomineed uncovered its genitals to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, launches a start business attempting to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology-leating's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to select where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt was "world domination".
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contacts listings, dolists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional utility tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it rests entirely with the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help solid make available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
As of this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the utilitys available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about introducing a total change all then, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In an placement on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the internet when he founded the Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate over netnutrity.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm immensely optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross-spiritually celebrated
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt.koll honors Bernard Vann earned the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew that he had earned the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandsons by Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic" that the stone is revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's awarded achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Vann led his battalion across the Channel de Saint-Quentin "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed to the firing line and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before storming man-only a field gun and knocking out three of the squad.
Lt.kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never live up to, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also lay a cliff after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feeled to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support to be given by a lot of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just not being able to see the main event.
The San Jose program featured 13 battles, including six on the main program to be broadcast directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the fight, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were uninhibited after staying specially awake for the battle into the early hours.
One supporter described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "one or other sick joke."
"It is government lawment that the content was not suitable at 6 p.m. and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company's President Scott Coker said they would work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think of the recast, I think we can probably figure out something," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to record it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it switched over, there were many textings sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to correct it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We'll limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally make – and we've tried to offer more to our fans and just go over our time.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'reducible' about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with an inferiority sense of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
24-year-old said he didn't before he went to high school realized that "not everyone like me is."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he had aired his feelings over gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that to have become a parent, let him care less about winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-year program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of illness.
When he appeared as a rejected one on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up because "keeping boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He said, "To this day, those feelings are of less than, and else feel, the true things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so that he did not disappoint anyone when they would eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner became a high-profile-LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to cover homosexuality.
He says he has aired his feelings because he's so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that to fall in love with a man – VS filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – " catch him on the side."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
"When you go through so much at such an early age" – he went to his first Olympic Games at age 14 and his father died three years later to cancer – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar altitude and lows.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says his "whole perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything went over 'I must win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not gonna be here to be in the front row, Dad'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed my life long about — diving before my home squad at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired its first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – which also residented with him in building up to the Olympics and still gives him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson not on dredging and withdrew from Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record Sunday when playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to manage his form to prevent it from being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record-12th time in the bi-annual event, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Furich for Saturday's four-ball games and four numbers.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day in between to be cheerleader and work on the practicebov at his game in hopes of correcting what is bad.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the straightest driver, so the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National track where the long rufield always punishes the errands.
And as if the track on its own is not challenging enough, Mickelson comes to stand in his ninth game on Sunday against accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed together with newling Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 single games well, Mickelson's game can be absolutely necessary.
Furich expressed his trust in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role he had today, gave me a knock on the back and put his arm around me and said he'll be right tomorrow," Furich said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Helde Hall and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think that he'd play two games.
I had more in store, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the track, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Sunday Nick Faldo's record for the player who played most Ryder Cup matches.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven halfs, although Furich said that his presence contributed intangible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, taken, liked to shave the fool, and he's a wonderful guy to have in the teamroom," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him, who was fun to see.
He offers as much more than just game."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows great lead can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable lead before the last day's single game in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Doen made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team led by Sve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead, but only narrowly won with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"One keeps reminding oneself that we had a major lead at Valderrama; we had a major lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we narrowly won," Bjorn said, on the picture, after watching how the Class of 2018 had won 5-3 and yesterday was 10-6 ahead at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going to be full-speed tomorrow.
Get out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I'm still saying all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players that're in our team, but we're also well aware of who stands on the other side – the best players in the world."
Rejoice over how his players sailed on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds, "I will never run ahead of it.
Tomorrow is a horse of another color.
Tomorrow, it's the individual participation that comes in turn, and it's a horse of another color.
It's wonderful to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you're there individually, you're being tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message you have to deliver to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furich will want his players to sail better individually than they did as playmates, with the exception of Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who received three points from four.
Furich itself has been on both sides of those great last-day fringes, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before he finished as a loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every deducted word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 had boldly talked his players in on his way to that last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as was seen at Brookline, as was seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins to go in one direction, it places a lot of stress on those middle games.
We set up our team accordingly and divided the men we felt, you know, will bring us anything magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counterattack and to stand in the main game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the upper half of the division.
"I chose this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it until the end," Bjorn said about his single-game choices.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The German military's latest frigate would have been employed in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The inuse of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new Baden-Wuertemberg-class frigates have now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
This vessel must have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-reference issues plagued this ambitious project's fate.
The four Baden-Wuertemberg-class vessels that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battle line of air rifle and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
But constant delays mean that the advanced warships – which will evidently enable Germany to project power overseas – will already become obsolete by the time they enter service, calls Die Zeit.
The disastrous F125-fregate reported last year when the German Navy officially refused to employ the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Vosss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent back a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return mission, but German media mentioned that a number of necessary "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Wuertemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the men's power on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also came to light that the ship was drastically overweight, reducing performance and reducing the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are thought to be double as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price label for the entire project – including training the crew – also affected an issue.
It evidently reached an incredible ›3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial &2.2 billion.
Problems that have the new frigates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the power of Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy's "ships that can be deployed are getting up."
The official said the issue worsened over time, for old ships were put out of service, but no substitute vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Bats' Secret Life
New research is being carried out on a estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to lead future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the ordinary and soprano bat as well as the brown longover and Daubenton bats at Inverse Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the property at important locations to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also do mobile recordings using hand-awards.
Ecspert sound analysis of all surveys will check the frequency of the bat troops and determine which species are doing.
A Havatcard and - report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat for the bats is most important and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and how to best manage forest countries for bats and other associated species.
Vler mouse populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly during the past century.
They are threatened by building and developing work that affects sleeping quarters and loss of habitat.
Windturbines and lightning may also pose a risk, as well as flypaper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-orientation technique to show bugs and hurdles on their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, are very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct recordings and sleeping quarters and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Land estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, very veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there are so many about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to better understand what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the necessity of looking for bats before maintenance is done in properties because it is possible that unknowingly destruction of a single maternity place can mean up to 400 females and young people's death and can eradicate an entire local population.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or hinder their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations fare."
Ronaldo dismisss rape protests while attorneys prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed rape protests against him as "false news" and said that people would "profit themselves" by using his name.
His attorneys are ready to sue German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The Portugal and Juventus advance player was accused of raping an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in 2009 in a Las Vegas hotel.
He reportedly then paid $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he addresses his 142 million followers, was published hours after the claims, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "falls news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything's right," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyer is getting ready to sue Der Spiegel about the claim, which, according to Reuters, they called "unaccessible reporting of suspicion in the area of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would demand compensation for "moral damages for any amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down to the alleged incident on his knees and said he was "99 percent" a "good guy" left in the stab by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensus.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and had photos of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was "banging for retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she wants to have the settlement reversed now because she was still traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault and moved this summer, in a &100 million agreement to the Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: UK will regret it 'for ever' if their car manufacturers lose
The UK 'will regret it forever' if they lose their status as a world leader in car manufacturing to Brexit, Berob Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "commenced" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will have to suspend production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a gene agreement-Brexit, can cost posts.
The Burnaston plant – producing Toyota's Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union last year.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU late March, we will see production stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have aired fears about leaving the EU without an agreement and how overtracking will operate.
BMW, for example, said that they would close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main entrepreneurs are related to what car manufacturers say lead chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just in time" base, with parts that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars being made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruption on the border that the industry says may lead to delays and shortages to parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep on more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will be discontinued.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "presidated to avoid those monitorings at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only to enjoy the present success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was an extremely successful set of lead chains."
Toyota could not say how long production will be discontinued but warned that added costs on the long term could reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost posts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and the Unite union's collaborator on the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back again.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed an exact and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump encounter with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-term meeting with deputy attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "seasoned with another week" while the fighting over nominated for the high court of Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian electoral intervention, links between Trump aiders and Russia and possible cross - bombing of the right by the president.
Whether Trump the deputy attorney general goes down or not, and through it will threaten Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip stories for months.
Earlier, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "elect not to" give thanks to Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate judiciary's trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who charged him with sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate destination.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date for it has not yet been determined, it can be this week, I can see that it is postponed with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court for another week.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders have not held a White House press information session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not due to a countervolve for TV journalist who is "effect hunt", although she said, "I will not argue with the fact that they are effect-hunted."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence, "We've looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will continue to occur, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly for the president of the United States, then it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it a lot and you've seen it do a lot in the past few weeks and it's gonna take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignity - billed armies.
Solo press statements are rare.
In New York surname week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbound and at times, bizarre appearance before journalists gathered there.
Secretary of Health writing to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit-vrese
The Secretary of Health has to EU staff who write in Scotland's NHS work to show the country's gratitude and express the wish that they will stay on to Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months over before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed them to covering costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the relegated public services.
In her letter, me. Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and EU continued on withdrawal, heading for expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government also intensified their preparations for a possible gene agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I want to repeat how much I value every staff member's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Collegas from all over the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service's work, and with which the patients and communities we serve benefit.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergo emergency surgery after main injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after suffering a main injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before rest time.
"He came to the margin and dropped sort of just there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen along the margin before being placed on a stretcher and taken backwards for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "no details about the type/range of the injury" and Tennessee still tries to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second-year, is at Tennessee State in his first season after moving from Illinois.
He took five times to death on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season at 18 deads.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to move young voters
The seal tax will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasurer expects to raise up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK – with the extra cash to be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to draw young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government's plans to counter homelessness.
The taxing tax – which is apart from the current seal tax, including the higher levels set two years ago on second houses and houses purchased to lease – may be as much as three percent.
The Treasurer expects that move to bring in £120 million a year.
A estimated 13 percent of newly built London property is purchased by non-VK citizens who push up the prices and make it more difficult for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – became "spook towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in stamp tax to help more young people own their first house.
He accused large construction firms of holding property prices high by picking up land, but not using it and encouraged Mrs. May to renounce quotas on affordable homes to restore Britain's "home strike disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rent control and an end to "no error settlements".
He also wants to give councils larger forces to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said I will devote my first ministry to restoring the British dream – that life must be better for every new generation.
And that means to repair our broken house market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
But it cannot be right that it is just as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign based companies to buy houses as for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness a too great reality."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at one point.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life in the North Islands team, which is currently in third place in Liga One, three points under the uppers.
He moved this summer to the Stadium of Light after leading back to the Scottish Premiership last season St Mirren.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I took the second team, but it was all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsund.
"But as a child, I often looked for Scotland with my father at Hampden and that's something that pulls me away.
However, the opportunity can come only if I'm successful with club management."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no anxiety in imitating such established names at such a large club, after he had previously turned down offers of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success will be measured for me by ‘' can I bring this club back to the Premier league?'
Due to the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful if I can get the club out there again."
Ross's career in management is only three years yet, after a period as an assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' training staff.
He then helped return for Alloa from relegation to the third league and converted St Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a true crossroads," he said when he recalled how he took over Alloa's lesions.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, for I've done good enough, made a reasonable living out of it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things to come through weekly.
I'm still going through it with respect to the stress and pressure of the job, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain's struggling bars' income, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking sites and bar groups saw sales rising 2.7% in July – but receivings in restaurants were down 4.8 percent, showed figures.
Peter Martin, of business consultation firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says, "Pounding sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a pattern similar to the previous month, June, when drinking places were up by 2.8 percent, other than that restaurants were hit even heavier.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Dronekie-led drinking places and bars did far better and rose more than restaurants dropped.
Food-led drinking places suffered in the sun as well, but not as bad as restaurant operators
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Throughout managed bars and drinking places, sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, with food being down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of recreation and hospitality analysis RSM said, "These results continue the tendency we have seen since late April.
Again and the impact of major social or sports events remain the greatest factors when it comes to sales in the out-the-house-out market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent years on year will be particularly difficult over and except constant expense pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring needed relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking venues and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the demand in trade branding.

One in five children has secret social media bills that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – has secret social media bills that they hide from their parents and teachers reveal a recording
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "falls Insta pages"
The news has raised fears that sexual content is placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "chief bill" to show parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media bills that keep them secret to adults.
A survey at 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "falls Insta accounts" – a reference to the photo-partyard Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "head account" to show parents but also had private bills.
One mother who came upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager urging others to "power her."
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmstresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private bills.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot detect them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish Athletics Board
Eiildh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executing director at the governing body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most covered track-and-field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far-reaching experience at international level during the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world atletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from what she brings to the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes I and hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta under his four golden Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after having a short-lived iskemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell whether I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but fully recovered, once again learned how to walk and perform skill exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pumping adtention comparing mothers to cows split opinions online
A pump company has divided opinions online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to cows milked.
In celebration of the piloting of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-elect music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom giving the pump to mothers milking out.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of straw and cows on the measure of a song that includes lyrics such as, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen, it's not oories, it's my breasts."
The choir section reads, "Pomp it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the firm's Facebook page has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 viewings and hundreds of remarks, the video received mixed response from viewers, with many saying it plays the "ruwelts" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Nes we have to conceive them and give birth to be able to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," wrote one.
The Elvie bors pump fits discripice in a feedingbra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person remarked, "Feertyly traumatic for mother and baby.
But yeah, why don't it use to advertise a breast pump for mothers they can keep babies?"
Someone else added, "The advertisement is so out of touch."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that the song was for her "screasenaaks".
"I think it's a genial idea.
I would have had one if I still breast - fed.
To milk out made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a genial product," one wrote.
Another person commented, "It's a fun advertisement directed to moms who milk out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows".
It is not an advertisement praising or judging the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discretioned pump in their bra's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is silent, has no strands or tubes, and fits discrepancy into a feeding zebra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while milking out.
Ana Balarian, partner and UKD at Mother commented, "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a major and provocative introduction.
By drawing a parallel between women who milk out and dairy cows, we wanted to demonstrate the excretion process and all its challenges in the spotlight, while in an entertaining way in which people can engage in the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made the news.
During London Modeweek, a mother of two appeared on the walkboard for designer Marta Jakubowski as she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrants had risen sharply though monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly due to fel rhetoric and policies set by the Trump administration making it more difficult to place children at sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to remain in the country was endangered by acting forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible sponsors and other adult members of their households should submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and customs maintenance before Congress testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied to sponsor unchased minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Amper 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large bunch of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to prosecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to cope more quickly, officials established new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status at an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in the past months.
Advocate says those concerns are increased at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling to be overlooked more easily due to the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends may worsen the trauma that many already have.
Syria tells VS, French and Turkish ‘setting forces' to withdraw immediately
When addressing the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy First Minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian land, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced, are "officially over."
He said that Damascus will continue "to wage this holy battle until we have purified all Syrian areas" of both terror groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mostly educate and advised both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrical fears urging refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these backs," he said.
"They polytize something that should simply be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkse agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-sided Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "evident deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who would be "cut out".
UN-scentant, Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon call together the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to the "nego of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the reelection in 2020, unless, as very liberally likely hopes, a state of accusation and scandals ends his presidency early.
In what without question "the most dramatic final of a presidency will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, peak time rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCC.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million peak time viewers, on from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" are at the top of cable viewing rates with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designant Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress Building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "For he makes me laugh"," told me. Scovell to me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can determine the future of Route v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite the health of the world economy.
To eliminate is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being just an informed citizen when in the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate over Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather-fly jacket ("a garment thick of the humrian", The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Parts that he does what makes it feel like a reality program is that he feeds you something every evening," said Brent Montgomery, operating head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pain Stars," about the Trump programme's varying role exchange and daily twists in the plot (such as looking for quarrel with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
One can't afford to miss one episode, or else you stay behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was looking inside to MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not tear him away, not with Brett Kavanaugh was on his way to appear before the Senate's Regbank and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the scales.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs at the time and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

Outcomes stream to teamsndest mid-term election races in House
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees an influx of money, due to a shift of congressional districts that two officers have now ended up in a race for the same seat.
The recently modified suburban Pittsburg district leaves Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – measures powers.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The charts were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined in January that the old districts were unconstitutionably dismissed in the Republicans' favor.
The race in the new 17th kicked off with a campaign funding competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Campaign's Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a narrow-craped win in a widely viewed special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congress district.
The seat was held for over a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
VS was considering filtrating El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then turned back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners disfellowshipped the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the state departments decided to call the U.S. heads back from diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama about the "imployed decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, earlier of dedemonth in a statement.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador who received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level Congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar convention last year considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the congress to continue effectively bringing an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address the congress, now scheduled for mid-Oktober, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new severe messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberation on the condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an out-analist who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that could happen may be the special deliberation about Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible cross-boming of the dish, of which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also thought to focus his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign has collaborated with Russia in the country's attack on our elections.
Were Congress to pass into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face liability in that body, just when he was preparing to go before the voters again, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peer group.
It's a bunch of axes, and with that I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of its counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the fight can be stretched out.
In 1938 German officials were ready to perform a coup against Hitler, if the West only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to be able to avoid the years' slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such twists and democracy's relentless course is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face several such turns.
What will we do if Mr. Trump deputy attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he had proposed secretly to take up the president last year and speculated about it whether he was competent for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times's report is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the interelection for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump answerable?
If we shell those tests, there lies a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jewish who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that lived in my ambassadors house at one time.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to go and light Sabbath-monkers on that table carrying the swastica.
With it as my origin, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimisticly prior to Rapid Vienna battle
Rangers play Thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna with the knowledge that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier dedemonth will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe League.
A union injury prevented middle-fielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2 equal impact against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this outcome as a springout for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We entered the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away there with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but a draw is probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's gonna be a difficult game, because they had a good outcome in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can press through and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly difficult, with all that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a well-feeling factor to the place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can now push through, sit behind us last season, and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this retirement savings scare.
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be looked after, few people speak to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide Study said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they talked to their children about it.
"People want a relative to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes long in advance.
Working with your advisor and your family to preach where and how to receive care, since those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor in: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding decisions for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self insurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut down legal battles at the pace.
Get a health care-vol Force in place so you assign a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that experts comply with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also consider empowered for your finances.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incompetent.
Don't forget the minor details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Game out those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues in question, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What's the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windbuks

The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as a " random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communication posted outside action, relief officials could not get any information from Donggala Regentship, an area north of Palu closer to the center of the 7.5 range of tremor.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regent that extends along over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regentship, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishery and farming are the support pillars of the Central Carolina Province's economy, particularly the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times during the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused over 200's death and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west-Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific's Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major quake along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26, leading to a tsunami that hit 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong tremors hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 range struck the south of Java, Indonesia was most populated island, leading to a tsunami that struck the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 range of tremor hit near the city of Padang, capital of West Carolina Province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 range of tremor struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, leading to a tsunami of up to 10 metres destroying dozens of towns and leading to about 300 deaths.
2016: A Level tremor struck the Pidie Jaya regimentship in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly tremor and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't this time lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 were killed because of buildings that crashed,
2018: Great tremors hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok, with over 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report issued Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took off a female knowledge phone with her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Trial facility and is detained on a $500 unseated sponsor, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "unguilty, decided" when asked what he was pleading, the network reported.
Palin faces three class A offences, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and $250,000 fined.
He is also charged with a class B offence, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal complaint was laid against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case currently serves before Alaska's Veteranehof.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a gun while drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his military service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake-sunami: hundreds died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi Friday.
The 7.5 range earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks were put out of action with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu City when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are looking for rare death penalty for suspect in NYC interreur attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City interreur attack that has caused eight people's death – a rare penalty not yet carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot neighbor truck to perform an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side speedway in Lower Manhattan to reap pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has killed the eight victims "meaning conscious" severe physical injuries, according to the notice of intention of asking for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges carry possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal major jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder in asset of extortion, which is typically used by federal prosecutors in reorganized crime cases, and a complaint of violence and ruining motor vehicles.
The attack called for "delightful planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "official, cruel and pervers".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Menza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco caused," noted the intentions notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York judicially prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being sentenced for a plot to express espionage for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were tendered with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Oezbelistan, demonstrated no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He mentioned to detectives that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov said the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently on the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo-advocats representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than accept a debt recognition to life prison penalty with no possible release will only extend the trauma of these events for all concerned." Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says that NIGL FARGE should be placed in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the people's military" today during a protest at the Tory Conference.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the "hits" of Eurosnitics – since one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he must be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that by the time the UK would be "out" as Mr. Farage Brexit secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to unite her deep-divided officers was initiated by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers tradeoff plan on dreef amid attacks of Brexiters, Remainers, and the EU.
Bondals insisted that she would push through in her attempt to make an agreement with Brussels despite the dead-way – and prosthetics and Labour force to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the Loop means Loop convention in Solulll that he wanted "Chequers out ofsmyt".
He suggested that Mr Farage had to be made a nobleman and the responsibility was given for negotiations with Brussels.
‘ If he were in charge, we would have been out by the time,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: 'I'll get up for Brexit, but we have to put Chequers out.'
He outlined his opposition to the EU, saying, "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone has declined proposals that public opinion has changed since the 2016 stenming: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain completely untrue.'
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: ‘ I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bomb the streets and make sure that we are selected in the first place.

Warren plans to ‘hard look at it' to stand for president
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she'll "hard look at standing for president" aà the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democrat spoke about her future during a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.

She has been in the middle of speculation that she might challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with consultations with the use of the city hall format since Trump is in power.
A reviewer asked her if she was planning to stand for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and it includes a woman at the top."

Police in Baton Rouge, LA., announced Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 B.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of shooting Friday and asked for help to identify a man seen in the image material.

"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the head and was finally killed as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media by 247sports Saturday.
Wayde set in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, owned by a weapon, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton bounds world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettle
It became apparent the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the racing.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettle to attack his teammate.
Vettle entered the wells first and left Hamilton to drive into the back of the bundle into traffic, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes found a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved ahead to wheel-to-wheel action that the Ferrari driver countersense risk-free saw leaving the inside at risk of outkeep to a double-move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstepen began from the back row from the spring schedule and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the racing as he held to his bands to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He came into the wells on the 44th round but could not speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a hard day, because Valtteri had done fantastic all weekend and was a true sir.
The team performed exceptional work to have a one-two," said Hamilton.
It was more brutally bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed at a convention Senator Diane Feinstein on her insistence that she did not lick Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which his Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the evidence that Ford had given before the Senate Law Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate had shown that people were "common and rude and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has gone on in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say "o, I haven't done it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lick?
Remember her answer...you licked the document - "o, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we lick it...No, we didn't lick it," he added, in an expression of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter setting out the allegations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak had come down from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't lick her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
However, the president did not consider her denial good and commented during Saturday night's convention, "I'm saying you what. It was rather bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominated accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means power.
You see the meanness, the inoffensity, they don't care who hurts them, who they have to drive to get power and control," Mediaite reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday's Elite League's loss against Belfast Giants by winning the counter game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-purpose lead by rolls from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownnie brought the home team equally before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee draw before two Luke Lundvald Nielsen objectives attached their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe's men who lost games first and then won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth assembly of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's openball came from a Kendall McFaul aid in the fourth minute on 3:35, with David Rutherford offering the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquadt became the provider for Cownnie's equaler at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took lead until the first break when he threw his second purpose of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again received their draw with a power game goal at 27:37.
Cownnie and Charles Corcoran stood together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who have now lost four of their last five games are at home to Milton Keynes in their next game Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people had taken off safely.
More than 800 people are dead and more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many are trapped in breakouts in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, however, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that swung heavily on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained unmovable to make sure that the Batik Air flight was 6321, which was at that time on the runway, able to rise safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he dropped in.
He later died in the hospital.
Spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Baikpapan in Kaliman to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll can reach the thousands with the country's disaster rendition agency saying that access to the towns of Dongglia, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll continues to increase as many corpses are still among the ruins while many cannot yet be accessed," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Golwe reaching up to 20 feet [6 m], has snatched Palu who will hold a mass funeral Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and stock.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute brings in an ambulance bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarks are sacked everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross chases to help survivors, but we don't know what they're gonna find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu Sunday and said to the country's military service, "I ask almaI of you to work day and night to complete each task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was once hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year in which more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says now one man is missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they have been unable to account for a male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane landed near the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had shot past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane came in very low.
"It's a special good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through mid-deep water to the emergency outlets on the sinking aircraft.
He said that the air attendants became panic - stricken and shouted and that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that ships who worked close to improving a quay also helped with an inflatable boat with the rescue to get people to land back and forth before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have been killed in collapses of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analistes set out timeline of evening woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the re-trial of a man charged for burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
V.S. department of Justice analysis Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined for the jury how he used cell phone records to gather the movements of 29-year-old charged Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the evening his death is.
Rowlett said that he received location data from different mobile phones showing that Tellis was together Chambers on the night of her death, which was in countertelling with his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "jok, because my truck was in Nashville."
Neither an inconsection is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information cleared off his phone.
"He certainly took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense was scheduled to begin its closing leading Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What's conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origin of political messages and the tackle of social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fuspirit and Common saw a recent recycling in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Neither a black person?
NY-kinderjuff sues couple for being fired after "rasist" text
A New York child-erjuffrou sues a couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving a miscommissioned message from the mother who complained that she was "nor a black person."
The couple deny that they're racist and compare the junction with "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, aired her upset when she learned that the new child carer, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first workday in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEE NÓG A SWART PERSOON," Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to me Maurice twice.
After realizing her flater, a "uneasy" Plasco-Flaxman fired me Maurice and said that they were outgoing children'suffrou who was Africa-American, doing bad work and that she had rather expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the dismissal and seeks his damages to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, resident work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such stuff," she told the Post Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple struck back on the claims that they were racist, saying that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice's employment and fear that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children into the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even though it was by tube?
Your newborn?
Then now."
Plasco compared the matter to "expression" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," added the investment banker.
As the legal case continues, the court of public opinion was quick to bring the couple on social media and cut them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not connect readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first reads it before it was published.
It is very entertaining that we know of Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been fervent if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC camera man before being inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's declaration after his death was last year "bittersweet".
About Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an apple-gay human," she said.
"But because Paddington was authentic to him, it was almost as if one had a child who had achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he viewed Paddington's success kind of that way.
Though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the credit for Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to greet over the phone
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got the call from Nad down to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashhi, I love you very much, heartlam.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was closing down.
I just had to sit there waiting, knowingly that it all unfolds.
I couldn't tjunk or scream or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold it together."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who by then was hurt for the loss of her daughter, accompanied by the other passengers on board the plane - unaware of the ordeal, she went.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sympathetic feeling for Nad on the flight.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have mailed cards for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people for support.
Me Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he started leading to depression and killed himself at 18 years of age.
"I want no parent to feel as I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They used to say that his smile lit up any room."
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother to be his own life.
Me Davis said, "I worry all the time that there's going to be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence--you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say that he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the most lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he did not make eye contact or something with them."
She said she died was very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It jerks a hole through the family.
It splits us apart.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still undecided as FBI investigation begins
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for--a timeless investigation that had no bestk - could bring us some unity," Mr Flake said Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was "falling out" under entrenched partisan congestion.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Their antiprevolentity is all due to timing.
The intermediate elections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fare badly, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to have elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met his wife Ashley through him and was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has produced its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a draw and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea overrunning numbers ‘dal' under Kim
The number of North Korean overruners to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislature.
Park Byeong-seug quoted data from the South's unification cabinet and said that there were last year 1.17 overlushings - compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher rates asked by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The great majority of overruners from the North are finally offered South Korea citizen law.
Seoul says more than 30000 North Irelands have illegally overflowed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flight via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly-protecting demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreans.
China considers the overruners rather than illegal immigrants than refugees, often repatriating them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South who are still technically at war with one another - have significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for conversations centered around the strike negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho blamed on Saturday US section for the lack of progress since.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there's no way that we'll disarm one sidedige ourselves first," said Mr Ri in a speech to the UN general meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeries", says he is incompetent to serve on the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh "histeries" and said that he was temperamentally incompetent to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the comment on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever acted like this, they would say ‘histeries'," Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Law Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening release, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times he almost shouted and screwed while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also expressly disapproved of Democrats on the committee, calling the claims against him a "bellious and coordinated character sneakericide", reorganized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think that he makes himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went on behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and as Democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's currently on," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. About Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Law on Constituency Care of Roe v. Wade as he is deemed a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh passed questions about whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘is it not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women should handle it.
It's a just diiteribe, months and years' anger that cooks over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," me Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who also said that she was crying when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she would have said to the person she spoke to, "You might think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for bridle because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early work in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and being grabbed at my neck skin by an older woman - a cold driver for whom I was somewhat scared - who dragged me into a reportal.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think that you're sad and will be happy, because they've had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressional woman from Kolorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was captured in an illegitimate relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the racing, my Schroeder, was severely frustrated, realizing that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snluge and the Seven Dwargies".
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with find-raising collections, so she vowed that she would not enter the race unless she collected $2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1.00 would give her only $250.
"Do they think I get discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - grateful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than partsholes, and angry for the sexism - that she had stitched.
You'd have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalled me Schroeder about how the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
How the US-Shina Trade War May Be Good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening and while the fight is far from over, a dispute between the countries may be in the long-term beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most interest escalation rolled in this week with new rates affecting $200 trillion (£150 trillion)'s items and effectively taxed half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing retaliated each time in goods and recently slapped rates of five to ten percent on $60 trillion's U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy is not going to move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to meet the US requests publicly will be too much of an embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing plays its charts correctly, pressure over US trade war over the long-term China can be a positive support by lowering the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that can start an economic toll flight in any one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant who focuses on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria ‘ready' for refugees to return, Minister of Foreign Affairs says
Syria says it is ready for the volunteer returns of refugees and appeals to help rebuild the country destroyed by a war for over seven years.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions improve in the country.
"Today, the situation at ground level is more stable and secure due to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore to normal the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the one-sided economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moolem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the flat-slane country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the invasion.
Europe Seals Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and won U.S. team with a final point of 16.5 by 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not yet won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
US-store Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, had his T-hold in the water explosive at the par-3 16th hole and had his match conceded to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari glistened in all his rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players ever to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
So grateful to Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia to the European victory
He suggests the torch to his compatriotor John Ram who conquered Sunday US-golflegatory Tiger Woods 2&1 in single game.
The incredible pride I feel, to win Tiger Woods, I grew big and looked at that guy," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the largest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second to only Jack Nicklaus.
Team US struggled all weekend to find the cleanfield with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau playing high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furich spoke on a disappointing performance on behalf of his team, "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
There was time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.
We deleted.
Howde down for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as their captain.
You have to keep your hat sloping.
We're surpassed."
