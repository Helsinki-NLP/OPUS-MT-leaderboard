There was a nine-year-old boy on the trip to Tampere.
The police have been on a search mission for a 9-year-old boy on his escape in Tampere on Tuesday night.
The disappearance report on the boy that left west of Tampere with his friend has spread in the social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and he has no risk of life and health.
The boy's father told him at midnight that he was found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the reconciliation.
They found the boy in the neighborhood of the home, Dad told me.
Ronaldo again as a squirrel... torch the paint difference into the Mess
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five paintings in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his factory in the Master's League.
The conflict between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo about the goal of the Master's league turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid, Ronaldo, moved to the top of all-time painter statistics alone when he shot a visitor in the Shahtar Donetski network with two hits of punishment traps and one of the play situation.
Ronaldo raised his paint balance to 80, when the Barcelona Mess, which was on Tuesday with him, had 77 hits.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has been complicit from the Italian football League in Serie A since the first year, but at the D-section of the Master League, it started with a strong 2-1 guest profit from Manchester City.
The winner made over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack bored Sergei Aguero's absence to his knees.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's ball game, came to the field only with the last ten minutes.
The other company of Manchester, United, also experienced hardships in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after the death of 1-2.
ManU's 20-year-old law supporter Luke Shaw's guest game took only 15 minutes.
The dangerously-looking strap of PSV Hector Moreno hit the target towards the attacked ManU package so badly that Shaw probably broke his leg.
Shaw was lying at the Eindhoven home stadium for about a ten minutes before the medical staff left to take him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests in the 41st minute to 1-0 lead, but ManU's joy took only a few minutes.
Moreno set it up in an extra time before the break.
In the second half, the winner of the PSV was made by Luciano Narsingh.
Paris Saint-Germain, the A-block, started in the Master's League of Painting.
This was the case with Angel Di Maria, Argentinian, switched to the PSG of Manchester United shirt.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball across the back corner of Malmö's goal guard Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made a second half-time PSG 2-0.
The PSG has been speculated to be among the successors of the season.
The presumption is not wrong, but the malmö of the league is not the best possible benchmark.
For the first time, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Starfighter of the PSG, confronted his professional career with Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team, Moscow TSKA, lost the B-game in Germany for Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately demanded a divorce - the president held the wrong speech.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, held the same speech he had held a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has held the same speech in the country's parliament that he held at the end of last month.
When Mugabe spoke 25 minutes ago, apparently didn't realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was in full spirit.
The MDC of the main opposition party asked Mugabe to resign from his mission because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusing had just happened in the Mugabe Bureau and that the President had not done anything wrong.
Mugabe's speech was earlier and now about China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extra summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented next week an additional EU leaders summit because of the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council leading the summit, Donald Tusk, assessed the request.
According to the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how they will be able to register more effectively in Europe.
According to Merkel, the negotiations on the quotas for asylum seekers are part of the table of the Ministers of Interior.
The professor admits in an emergency call he shot his girlfriend.
Professor Shannon Lamb of the University asked a voice on an emergency call to a bit of a vibrant police officer at his house and told him he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb mentioned in particular that their beloved dog was present and alive and probably scared. The professor told me that the contact details of the dead woman's family would be on her phone.
In the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a letter written on the white paper: "I am very sorry, and I hope I could cancel my actions. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," in a letter signed by Lamb, read by the authorities.
There was no sign that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University in Cleveland, had already travelled 500 kilometers to the school campus. The police found a history professor Ethan Schmidt, who was believed to be dead at the campus.
Lynn Buford, Head of Police at Delta State University, said that the university's authority received information about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb called a fatal emergency call for a while after this.
There was one more death event for the day, and Lamb took his life when the police hit him.
The next day, the students and the educational staff kept their whisper behind locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb’s motive.
Researchers worked out the details in both locations, and Lamb’s known teachers told the man, and the researchers had a picture of a talented but perhaps troubled teacher.
Students always said they were looking forward to the professor's lessons.
According to the Gautier police of the Moratorium of Prentiss, the professor had no history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned in a book written by Lamb, which had given credit to “the wonderful people ” with whom he had been able to spend an academic life.
Both worked at an institution of social sciences and history with 17 students. Many of the students participated in the courses of both men.
However, there were references to the problems.
The lamb-present student Brandon Beavers told me that the professor seemed to be anxious and nervous, "as if he had something wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him about stress at the end of the academic year 2014-2015.
Lamb had previously requested medical leave from Delta State University because of some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
The recent changes in the university’s remuneration policy meant that the claim for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him the status of an assistant professor.
Principal William LaForge told me that he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lamb was clearly troubled by something.
These are the questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
After leaving campus, the police found out what route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his life with a 38-caliber pistol in the backyard of the house in Greenville, about one and a half miles from the home of his parents, Methel Johnson told me.
Lamb's car was still running on the yard.
The police didn't immediately figure out why Lamb had gone to this house, but Johnson told me he believed that he knew the residents of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started working as a science teacher at a university with 3 500 students. The city had 12 000 inhabitants in 2009 .
In the spring, he got a doctorate in educational science.
One of Lamb's long-term friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she met with Lamb's friends when she was 15 and Lamb 20 years old.
She and her friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried to teach Hairston guitar music for years.
"The lamb was a real heartbreaker at that time.
All the girls were on her plane," said Hairston, now 40 years old, who lives in Jackson's front town in Brandon.
Looks like Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but no document says they were married.
A couple of them had a dog called Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in a river swab in the small town of Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Sten, told me he's divorced from Prentiss 15 years ago, and the couple had remained friends, and they have a daughter now 19.
"He was totally shocked," said O'Sten about his daughter.
"The daughter and mother were the best friends."
O'Sten hadn't met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both appeared at a summer event three years ago.
Later, they used to play together sometimes.
According to O'Sten, his daughter is composing and performing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and part-time entertainment coordinator at the lowly restaurant in The Jurep Room outside Gautier, reported that he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, when Lamb had played guitar and lipharp for a few audiences.
Nothing could have said that something was wrong.
"A happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We were joking together.
They both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who died, led the first year of seminars and was specialised in the history of Indians and colonial times," said Professor Don Allan Mitchell.
She was married, and she had three little children.
He studied emporia at State University in Kansas and was chairman of his own brotherhood and college.
There are 900 people at the Delta State University campus in Cleveland who met at the Memorial in the light of the candles, including the educational staff, other staff, students and the residents of the region.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and Brother Jeff Schmidt, also participated in the night's event where the choir of the University presented the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The teaching will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis situation is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported Mississippi from Cleveland.
Helping journalists: Associated Press journalists Emily Wagster Pettus Mississippi in Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, because the police are telling us now that Lamb called an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was further specified that although Lamb referred to the emergency call as the wife of Prentiss, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us intends to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to hire seasonal workers as much as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products tells his current employees and seasonal workers to offer additional hours of work.
The company intends to hire 40 000 people to shops and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it hired 45 000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
The interviews will be started this month, and new employees will start in October to December.
Although there are still months of vacation, the trade season approaches well, and companies are preparing to hire temporary labour for shops, shipments and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The first night of the film "Return to the future" was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night also had personal meaning.
"We sat in the theatre and waited for the royals to arrive, and I noticed that there was a empty place next to me. For me, the princess Diana is coming next to me," Fox told me that the Back in Time document was coming to the trailer.
"When the movie started, I realized the situation looked like a date with the Princess of Wales."
Back in Time document relates to the future of the Return Films, and the document also interviews Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future, the film got her first night 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely a time-to-day film for me," said Spielberg.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD formats and presented in selected film theaters since October.
UN Secretary General: No military solution in Syria
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-mon, commented on the enhanced military action in Russia and notes that there is no military solution to a nearly five-year conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to combine their forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban told me that he was going to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France, to discuss the situation in Syria.
Mr Ban regretted that the diversification of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces have caused a situation that cannot be resolved.
Mr Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate similar solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis to achieve the Iranian nuclear agreement.
Number 8 of support surveys: Is Donald Trump serious?
Trumps have been attempted to make them an empty talker.
He's also been considered a joke.
Some are predicting a collapse for Trump.
In the Republican circles, no results have been (first) sought in every way to pull Trump down from the gallop.
Ten of the eleven National Gallups show Donald Trump two-digit support figures, some of them are seriously considering what it says in practice about the candidates of the real estate mogul.
Although, the elections are only at the beginning.
No one has yet been announced that Trump will be elected as a Republican candidate.
Experts recall that Rick Perry, who was in the Gallup harp at this time in 2011, was allowed to give space to the rising Herman Cain, neither of them finally won the candidate election in any state.
For many reasons, the Trump would be difficult in the general election.
External groups, such as Jeb Bush Super PAC and the economic Conservative Group Club for Growth, have noted the strong position of Trump and started digging into his decay.
The following fresh gallup data show that the real estate mogul cannot be ignored with a shade:
There's been a complete translation of the support of Trump.
Just before Trump announced that he would become a candidate in the mid-June, according to the Gallupe of Monmouth University, only two of the ten Republicans had a positive picture of the real estate moguist.
By mid July, 40 percent already had a positive picture.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding share was 52 per cent.
Now, six out of ten Republicans have a positive picture of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten are negative.
These figures will also be kept in the states where the elections will be held first.
In the Quinn market gallupi last week, 60% of Republicans had a positive view on Trump.
Two thirds of the Republicans would be pleased with the Trump candidate.
At the CNN and ORC Gallup last week 67 per cent of the Republicans stated that they were very satisfied or satisfied with the possible choice of Trump as candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with the Trump candidate.
Ben Carson is almost as eager to receive Trump (43% would be very pleased with the Carson candidate and 40% with the Trump candidate).
Who's next the most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, whose corresponding contribution is 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republicans would be unhappy or very unhappy if Jeb Bush was elected as a party candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is a problem.
Donald Trumpia has been widely criticised of the magnificent and insulting comments. 52% of the Republicans' supporters across the country consider the properties of the real estate mogul as suitable for the president.
The same is true of Iowa, where the party meeting is held first: According to the Quinn market gallupe, 52 per cent of the Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities to be suitable for the Head of Defence Forces.
According to ABC and Post's gallupe, 44 percent believe that Trump is unable to function effectively in the task, and six out of ten consider Trump's temperament to be inappropriate to the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
According to the CNN and the ORC gallupe, four of the ten believes in the opportunities of Trump.
This has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on behalf of Jeb Bush.
Total: Republicans have never had very reliable crystal balls in use before.
At this point, four of the ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a probable candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to think the Trump campaign is convincing.
Even if the Republicans support another candidate, Trump covers almost all the other candidates.
Some experts believe that the divided camp is likely to benefit from the Tromp when the opponents of Trump are divided into the supporters of the various candidates.
At the beginning of September, the Monmouth University opinion survey revealed that in an imaginary double fight between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would almost always have a larger team of support.
He runs Carly Fiorina 13 points, Marco Rubiota 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bushia 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trump's only true opponent?
Ben Carson would take the victory from Trump to 19 points apart from the imaginary double fight.
A narrow majority of the supporters of Trump has already made a vote.
According to the Gallup published by CBS and NYT on Tuesday, fair half of Trump's supporters are certain of their voting decision.
Of course, the situation can change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46 % of Trump's supporters have not taken a final decision.
Trump's very competitor at this moment is the neurochirurg Ben Carson, but the voters who have already chosen their candidates are twice more likely to vote for the Trumps.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of migration.
In his campaign speech called Donald Trump two months ago, migrant rapists from Mexico have been a hot topic for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's magnificent speeches expel important Latin American voters from the Republican troops and hinder the reform of the brand.
However, according to the results of ABC News and Washington Post’s opinion surveys on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are in line with Trump on migration issues.
As long as the migration is in the light, Donald Trump is also.
Dissatisfaction with administration is at the top.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republicans' votes.
The Republican troops want a new face as a candidate instead of a political conkar. According to ABC News and Washington Post's latest opinion survey, the Republicans had six out of ten.
These two candidates are also angry with Washington.
According to Des Moines Registry and Bloomberg Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated in the Republicans' activities in the Congress: 54% are unsatisfactory and 21% on the edge of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since the elections, Corbyn's first performance in the Prime Minister's Question Time has been expected to
For the first time, Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party Labouri's new sculpture, is supposed to stand up in the David Cameron Question Time later.
Corby's first six questions, just after half a day, and the media and the representatives of the Labour Party are following the man with a hard eye.
Corby's been calling for less theatre and more fact for a weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip part of the meetings and leave them to his colleagues.
Corbyn's leadership will be weighed in line for the first time. Corby will now be subjected to a parliamentary test following the gathering of the shadow government and the speech of the Corbyn Association of Professional Unions at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
The decision of the Labour Party to silence during the National Song on Tuesday at the 75th anniversary of the British Air War has been criticised by a number of representatives of the Tory Party.
Corbyn's silence during the national song attracted attention.
Corbyn's representative said that Corbyn was standing during the national song, respecting silently the heroicism of the Royal Air Forces in the Battle of Britain.
However, in the BBC Two's Newsnight programme, a member of the Corbyn shadow government, Owen Smith, said that he would have called on the party's leader to join the national song despite the opposition to this monarchy.
The tenth Minister of Shadows has refused to join Corbyn's first tribunals in appealing to disagreements in economic, defence and external affairs. Less than a sixth part of the party initially supported Corbyn's choice of political leadership.
The BBC's policy correspondent Robin Brant believes that political disagreements on the EU membership of the United Kingdom and the tightening of the government's conditions for granting benefits have accumulated in the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at the TUC meeting that Labour intends to propose amendments to remove the restrictions completely.
Hours later, the Minister for Labour and Pensions of the Shadow Government, Smith, said that the position of the party was very clear: it is only opposed to the government's plans to lower the limit of 26 000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corby is the fifth leader of the labour that David Cameron has been confronted by the Tory Party over the past decade.
A new approach to policy says the Labour Director has chosen the questions to Cameron from its 30 000 proposals to the public.
According to Mr Corbyn, who has been elected from the Islington North district, there are too many controversies in the Question Time, and he promises to avoid squeaky speeches and licensing and, instead, say that he focuses on serious topics such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has stated that the shadow minister Angela Eagle will bring her in Question Hours, for example when Cameron is on the foreign road.
Mr Corby has also thrown the idea in the air that others might sometimes be able to get out of voice, telling him that he has discussed this with Mr Bercow, the chairman of the Parliament's sub-committee.
After Corbyn’s upcoming party leadership in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a doll theatre policy, which is often attached to the survey hours, but some years later he admitted that he failed in his efforts.
Since the first hour of questioning was televisioned in 1990, it has been considered to be a key indicator of the director's criticism, sub-room management and status. However, critics believe that the Question Time has become a carikaté, which needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless young photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
A group of former street children has found a way to learn and earn.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit description studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph their homeland and earn it at the same time.
BBC News met a young man who has completed the project among the first ones.

Punta is stronger when British wages are rising
The weight was strengthened when wages were rising in Great Britain, and SABMiller drew up the FTSE 100 index.
In May-June, wages increased by 2.9 per cent in Great Britain compared to the corresponding period last year.
The faster than predicted was the fastest growth since 2009.
The weight was increased by 1 % and its rate was quoted to USD 1.505, which also increased in relation to the euro, and was quoted to EUR 1.730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and ended at 6.229.21 points.
The highest increase was made by SABMiller, which was 20 per cent shortened when the company received an initial buying-in offer from AB InBev.
When trade is carried out, the two largest brewery companies in the world would combine brands under the same roof, including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share increased by 0.9 per cent in the old water of the rival Richemont Group.
The latest sales figures in Richemont are better than predicted. The development of the sales was also the result of a rise in Burberry's key market in China.
The share of Glencore increased by 5 per cent of its declared miners' intention to raise $22.5 billion in shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mond's shares were the biggest drop in 4,3 % when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's share price for sale.
JD Sports' course rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports enterprise announced that its return before taxes would rise by 83 per cent to 46.6 million pounds.
JD Sports boss: higher wage costs could impede enlargement
According to Peter Cowgill, the president of the JD Sports Management Group, an increase in the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher costs of the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs could jeopardise the JD Sports enlargement plans and reduce the need for more labour.
Metcash lans the grassroot campaign against Ald's rim
Metcash seeks to secure its IGA sales from Ald's power in Southern and West Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain the market share of IGA-smart shops in Southern and Western Australia against the Australian invasion of Ald 700 million dollars.
Aldi intends to open two distribution centres and the first up to 120 shops in Southern and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA-supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands on the market in mainstream and social media, and by organising events such as Adelaide show.
IGA sales and suppliers and many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, Simmo, an ice cream factory in Dunsborough, offers tastes in IGA stores, and traders sell tickets to main customers to South Australian football League games at a discount price.
Metcashin is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September when the food, alcohol and iron store organises the annual investment strategy day.
This is an important market, as Southern and West Australia represent almost 30% of the IGA footprint of Metcashi stores, and in these regions the catalyst is higher than the IGA sales network of the Eastern States.
Southern and western Austrian consumers are known for their region, and IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. South Australia has a market share of 30% and in Western Australia 24%, while only 14% in the eastern states.
For example, Morgan Stanley's analysts believe that Aldi catches 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA traders can be sold by 360 million and Metcash's 250 million lottery by the end of 2016.
The prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in South and West Australia next year and will reach the sales of $500 million and $600 million in these areas.
Metcashi's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volumes can mean a loss of $13 million before interest and taxes, Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in the eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although Roy Morgan's recent study has shown that the most faithful customers of every company are.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi’s food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.1 per cent in 2018.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, head of the Magellan Financial Group, told me that at a meeting in Melbourne, Metcash would be very likely to disappear completely within 10 years.
Metcash has refused to take a public position on Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of Metcashi's board contacted Douglas last week.
The share of IGA has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and the result of the Metcashi food business serving the 1200 IGA dealers has decreased by 43% from the level of 2012.
However, the wholesale trader is taking counter action and is making an annual crop of over 150 million Australian dollars to respond to the prices of Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products every week. Ketju wants to support traders in the reform of shops so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the range of food for its own labels.
According to Metcashi’s CEO, Ian Morrice, price review and business reform plans are in good speed and the company will be able to re-establish its profits for the first time in 2017 for four years.
Steve Healy, Chairman of the Australian Tennis Union, defends Thanasi Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his behavior instead of the criticism of special advertising.
According to Steve Healy, the chairman of the Australian tennis union, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a side victim in the recent Nick Kyrgios-related junction.
The younger party of the "Special K" named Kokkinakis was disgusted when the evil boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka Montreal at the ATP tournament.
Shortly after this, the judge had to separate the competitors twice in the fight between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati. "Wawrinka should have given back to the Kyrgios and my guy," Harrison said.
In the open U.S., Kokkinakis frustrated into the bat's field when he was spoiled by powerful cramps. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinak.
At the moment, the teenage is at Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth about the only two-game player behind Bernard Tomic at the Davis Cup semifinal against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe that your Thana has been dragged into their dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the fight in the U.S. open, and he's not the first player to break his mile because of frustration. I know Thanas so well that he's not proud of what he's doing.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the provocative use of Harrison in the U.S. open, and I think he deserves recognition.
He has a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's only been treated a little unrighteously.
He is very mature to be 19 years old, he works hard and complements the team well. He has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected among the players. He exercises hard, is in good condition and is a very stable and mature young man. I think he should be judged on the basis of his own sealines."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team on an important round starting as suspicions. Healy describes the solution to a joint decision for all parties. However, he supports the return of Canberra to the team for long-term confirmation.
" Firstly, we want to focus fully on the fights instead of the pole associated with Kyrgio," Healy said.
Nick has risen quickly. As Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man is going to grow publicity in the light of his bad mistakes, and he deserves his criticism, but we are trying to support him so that he understands the consequences of his actions, and we are also trying to make his own peace, and I believe that it is best for the whole team and for Nick."
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
On Tuesday, Hungary closed its southern border from the direction of Serbia and captured illegal immigrants, which was intended to prevent the flow of the migrant.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in non-cense lands, and the Serbian authorities react fiercely.
People fleeing violence were forced to stay in the roadside between the inspection stations of the countries for an indefinite period
The insult began to rise.
As the police helicopter flew in the air, they were going to say, "Open the border!" and screaming insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some were protesting at the food and drink strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that it would not accept that migrants would be sent back to Hungary at the same time as more from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, does not increase the damage.
Ivica Dacic said that the situation should be discussed in Brussels in the next few days and also in other countries.
The death at the Hungarian-Service border began a day later when the 28 national groups failed to develop a common migration policy at the contested meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the flood of 40 000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece is shared, and that the meeting raised the hope of reaching agreement by the next month or the end of the year on which 120 000 migrants, including Hungary, would be received from the EU Member States.
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria invited an extra summit to the next week in order to discuss the country's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not hope for rapid action in Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that the authorities in two southern regions were allowed to take more effective means, i.e. to close roads and speed up judicial processes in the area of asylum.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Sijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a bargaining wire to the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migration flows from that direction, now that there is already a fence ready at the Serbian border.
The correspondent of CBS News, Charlie D'Aga, reported that even prisoners participated in the final tender for the completion of the tiles between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and a transit point for migrants to the European Union, many of these immigrants are refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that the majority of the incoming people are living-up refugees, not war refugees who have the right to seek security, but that there are sharp differences in the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
According to the new law that came into force at midnight in Hungary, it is a crime that crosses or damages the four-metres-long steering wire that has been built by the government towards the southern border in the direction of Serbia.
"The situation caused by mass migration has led the government to declare a crisis situation in the country," Zoltan Kovacs, a government reporter, told journalists in the town of Szeged in the southern part of the country.
"We follow a stringent line: illegal crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still needs to accept the military measures expected next week. The suppliers of the Associated Press News Office at the border have seen heavy armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban’s interior security advisor, said that the authorities have captured 45 border crossings immediately and 15 further.
The fence is damaged by people across the border now under the control of the police, charged with crimes under new laws.
The authorities will quickly fix the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossing points on Tuesday. One border crossing place was closed by means of a treaded train wagon.
Chaos captured the main border crossing point near Rosske in Hungary, when the Hungarians opened the small metal container to which the people joined.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands of them stayed outside.
The second group of migrants closed the main street that combines Serbia and Hungary. People reported themselves in the food and drink strike until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership compared to Bernie Sanders contracted half by national gallupe
The percentage of support for former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still a two-digit contest for the national presidential candidate for Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders has been distant.
The support of Clinton is now 47% of the votes of the Democratic Citizens (from 58%), while Sanders is second to 27% (from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure in the presidential race, and his support among the Democrats is 15%.
More than five months before the elections, it is too early to tell the majority of the Democrats who are in favour of.
However, Clinton's supporters are more sure of their choice.
Clinton has lost support from a number of democratic groups since the gallupe CBS News last month, whereas new supporters have joined Sanders' camp.
Clinton still has a strong leading role among women and moderates, but the management has fallen.
Clinton's support among men has fallen considerably, and he has only a 5% bow compared to Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership among democratics under the age of 50 and now he is at level with Sanders.
However, Clinton remains a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's advance in support of Sanders among the liberals was two numbers, but now Sanders has taken a five-prozent neck to Clinton in this group.
Approximately half of the Democrats are happy to support Clinton if he is elected as a party candidate.
The fourth would support Clinton with the smallest reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is not surprising that the current supporters of Clinton would also be particularly enthusiastic if he was elected as a candidate.
There is more divergence among those who are currently not in favour of Clinton. Only about a quarter would support him with enthusiasm.
Of the democratic voters, 48% would support Clinton, and only 35% of the Republican voters would be eagerly in favour of Donald Trumpi, the most popular Republican candidate.
When the Clinton voters are asked freely to describe why they are in favour of their candidates, the most popular argument is the correct experience of Clinton (16%). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to choose the female president (13%) and, thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same views and opportunities to win the actual elections are also mentioned.
The vice-president still weighs on his possible candidates, and 57% of the Democratic voters would like him to go to the race, and a third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When the second most popular candidate is inquiring from the Democratic Voters as a party candidate, most of them will choose Biden.
Over half of Clinton's supporters, Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the democratic candidates' race, Hillary Clinton will grow its advance towards Sanders, while Sanders is 20 percentage points away, and it will grow to 30 percentage points if Sanders does not go to the race.
55% of the democratic voters consider Clinton a candidate who has the best chance to win the actual elections, but the proportion has declined from 78% last month.
The second, Biden is far away from Clinton, but more and more believes in Biden's ability to win the actual elections.
Democracy voters, however, consider views on matters more important than the chances for candidates to win.
The voters do not consider any democratic candidates or potential candidates to be unacceptable.
Voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be suitable for their characteristics.
Most people think of Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, reliable and manager types.
Biden is mostly considered to be honest, while Clinton is mostly considered a leader type.
Up to 30 per cent of the democratic voters do not think Clintonia is honest and reliable, Sanders is 15 per cent. 27 per cent cannot say whether Sanders is honest.
Democracy voters believe that the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to the voters' own ideology.
For all characteristics, about a quarter there is no opinion on Sanders.
When the voters are asked for views on the use of the Hillary Clinton private e-mail and their own servers as a foreign minister, the majority of the Democratic voters say that they are satisfied with the Clinton explanation and have not changed the perception of these voters of Clinton.
The Americans broaderly disagree.
Half the Americans are unhappy with the Clinton report, and there is only one third of the satisfaction.
The public's opinions were divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
The majority of Americans believe that the use of the contested e-mail has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
The majority of this 36%, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the voters of our own party consider Clinton honest and reliable, there is a room for improvement in these qualities when we ask for the views of all voters: Clinton considers only 32% honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters do not think Clinton is honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters across the country do not consider the Trompia honest and reliable.
But both Clinton and Trump get good grades for leadership.
The six candidates involved in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush, were considered to be the most reliable.
The majority think Sanders is honest, but as with Carson, many do not have the opinion of Sanders.
The survey sample is 351 voters and the error margin of the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson catches Donald Trump's advance in a national support survey
According to CBS News and New York Times' latest support survey, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trumps.
These two candidates had more than half of the votes in the new survey and left the other candidates far behind.
In the Republican voters of the whole country, Trump still has strong support. The support rate has risen from 23% of the CBS survey carried out before Fox News last month.
Carson’s support would, however, lead to a glorious rise in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support for all the population groups, and in the higher-schooled group, he beats Trump.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasich of Ohio, will stay far. The support of Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin is the weakest and has fallen from 10% last month now to 2%.
The former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida shared the third position with 6% support.
The error margin of 376 Republican voters in the sample is 6% in the direction or in the other. The survey was carried out in September.
According to the latest survey of CNN and ORC last week, Carson's support is rising, and he is in favour of 19% of the Republicans, while Trump's support is 32%.
In the latest survey of ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was also clearly headed before Carson.
During the meeting of the men last week, Trump put unreasonable accusations on a retired neurochirurg, however, Carson apologized for questioning the faith of Trump.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday when he was campaigning in Iowa.
Five members of the department charged for the death of the Baruch College Fuks
Nearly two years ago, after the death of a student in the district ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people are charged with murder charges.
Baruch College (City University of New York) Members of the Delta Psi Department brutally abused Chun "Michael" Deng in September 2013. According to the police, the department did not deliver Deng in time to the hospital, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim’s eyes were tied, his back was put in a bag filled with almost 15 kg sand and had been repeatedly attacked in trying to reach a target that was placed on the other side of the frozen field.
Deng is reported to have first chosen a headache and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of the Pi Delta Ps Department did not call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness, they were supposed to wait an hour before Deng was taken to the hospital.
At a press conference, Commissioner Chris Wabner told me that the members, however, had the time to change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the section president.
"In this phase, the members began to hide the equipment, putting the interests of the department ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
Deng couldn't be recovered, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been hit several times in the head, to the upper body, and I traveled with a boring object.
"A lot of families have been shocked by the coupling of the department, because at least one student per year has died as a result of the cimpling since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a representative of the Deng family.
The departments and their members must be responsible for taking an important step by the authorities.
The grand jury in Monroe County filed five members of the department for the murder of a third degree.
In addition, 32 members of the department will be charged with smuggling and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to be responsible not only for individuals, but also for the organisation that officially or informally approved the cushion," Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College placed the department on a ban, and the national department resigned.
This impacts the increase in interest rates of the US Central Bank (Fedin)
Interest increases and stock market rises were acidified, the return on securities is rising and the economy is slipping down.
That's what we know.
However, we do not know how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular with regard to the economy, we find an indication of timing in history.
Lama has arrived up to 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often raises interest rates aggressively, but not always. The solution is how financial and financial assets react.
Therefore, the central bank officials have already stressed the fact that investors do not pay attention to the fact that the increase in interest rates starts, but to how long it will take to normalise the situation.
There are, of course, a number of variables involved.
However, in the end, market operators may find that all the interest increases may be overreacted.
"The first lifting of the Central Bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the loss of cheap money," Julian Jessop, the Capital Economics chief global economist told his customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalisation of interest rates to be at a rather low level, which is a scary standing shock for many.
However, that does not mean that there are no effects.
Examples of how the impacts can be seen in different economic areas based on historical trends:
As has been seen on the market for about a month, the trend in interest increases can increase instability for some time.
When the interest finally rises, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend would appear to be the stagnation of the capital interest income after the first increase for 12 to 24 months, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy, the Deutsche Bank analyst stated in a recent study of the effects of the increase in interest rates.
Over 35 years, the market is generally seen as a sharp increase at the time of the increase in interest rates, approximately 14%, relatively even after 250 days (mean increase of 2.6%), after 500 days, and the average interest income after the six stock balance is 14.4%, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management chief equity strategic Barron's.
According to Deutsche, the impact on the shares will generally increase slightly later than the cycle and interest income will begin to decrease.
Lama is a fact in the economy, but the increase in interest rates usually work.
In this case, if the central bank meets conditions which were not previously existed and could speed up the recession.
Particular attention is being paid to the fact that the GDP is at its lowest ever in terms of raising the central bank's control interest.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 management interest increases since 1950, only twice the nominal value has been below 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it being sustainable, and in the third quarter it is 1.5 per cent, says the regional central bank of Atlanta.
In raising interest rates in this sensitive economic situation, there may be a risk and it can be asked whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
In the market, the operators have talked about the upwards of the management rate for the whole year, and the views will turn to the meeting of the Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee) this week, which will end on Thursday.
Many strategies and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee accepts the lift at this meeting, the future trade seems to be only 25% probability.
"In our studies from 1950 to today, all the lifting cycles have been in a super cycle, where the GDP before the fall will also rise very quickly since the rising fluctuation began," says the report.
Recovery has been very slow compared to the worst lamb of the year.
The cyclist is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now it is already in the 74th month.
In addition, fixed-income securities have been unstable in the past of the market, and the scheme also recurs on the capital side.
"The underlying difference is that the effect is faster in bonds than in shares when the central bank changes the course.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to change the direction immediately when the first steering/calculation cycle starts.
At the end of the rising cycle, incomes will immediately fall," Deutsche said.
The strategicists of Charles Schwab believe that the interest rate will lead to long-term and short-term bonds approaching each other and to a level playing field.
"The high-income bonds often do better in such a environment, even though we are still cautious about return," said Kathy Jones, analyst at the fixed-income securities in Schwab.
Interestingly, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future change in direction of the Central Bank.
"In addition to the increase in Dolar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of tighter adaptation of the financial policy," says Jones.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is direct, the credit risk margins have increased and volatility increased, all are typical of the market in a situation where the central bank tightens policies.
In broad terms, companies operating mainly on the US market benefit as the interest rate decreases and local products begin to attract.
The prospects of debt-related multinational companies are weaker, as a stronger dollar makes their product more expensive on the global market and increases in debt.
"The history shows that quality shares are more profitable in the next three months of the purchase," Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Companies with strong balance sheets overrun the weak balance sheet companies after the interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on average, by five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares were also better off quality, on average 4 and 3 percentage points better.
"It's a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable interest rates lose the most," said Goldman.
Outside the stock market, consumers also benefit from the increase in dollars.
Savingers also benefit from higher yields, although experts disagree about how quickly the effects are seen.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
The Conservative Andrew Bingham criticizes the radio station for excessive popularisation.
Bingham thinks it's hard to separate the channel from its commercial competitor.
He also claims the BBC Music Awards prize gala for a copy of the British gala.
In turn, Parliamentist Damien Collins is accusing The Voice of inhumanity.
According to the significant parliamentary, BBC Radio 3 is gradually transformed into a copy of the Classic FM channel. The charges increase the pressure on the station to prove that they offer other commercial radio stations.
The Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC’s director that the broadcaster’s radio channel is becoming too popular and that the channel is no longer separated from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularisation, but Radio 3 seems to be changing in the direction of Classic FM," Bingham said.
The last December BBC Music Awards Prize will also receive criticism from Bingham:
"The last year BBC Music Awards organised for the first time seems to be a copy of the British Prize gala.
These two are examples that instead of new and different, only what is already on the market is being imitated," says Bingham.
The Director-General of BBC denied the accusations and stated that the supply of BBC Radio 3 has a significant increase in the number of commercial competitors in live music and influential content.
"Radio 3 taught me from classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel’s commitment to living music and music is in its own class.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 is also committed to looking for new music and ordering new works," the President-in-Office said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that the station has to work harder to maintain the audience's interest, since the British are better familiar with classical music.
Radio 3, however, is not the only one in the consultation of the BBC channel, a limited Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, which has been criticised for entering the commercial channels.
Damien Collins, Parliamentist of the Tory Party, criticized the talent search competition that BBC bought from a Dutch producer in Talpa Media. The price of the trade is estimated at 22 million pounds.
"The programme is not much debated because it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1, which, as stars, is glorified by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced by BBC as a typical way.
In addition, Collins asked the company to find a hot show in their own garage when the next time Collins drew up a new show of entertainment.
Collins, however, refused to exclude the continued order of the "The Voice" series or the use of taxpayers' money for other entertainment formats.
The slowest growth of online trade in August – perhaps black Friday
In the first few months of 2015, net sales grew by 7 per cent.
The sale of online trade has been statistically recorded since 2000, last month, the slowest growth ever was.
The online trade was strengthened three years ago by mobile sales.
Experts believe that November black Friday can control the demands for shopping.
For more than ten years, the overrun of online trade has devastated many of the UK buying streets.
According to the experts, there are indications that online trade is aligned, and the new sales figures show a growth of only 7 % during the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was the slowest throughout the period when online sales were statistics, i.e. since 2000. Last year net sales grew by only five per cent.
According to the experts, there are indications that online trade is aligned, and the new sales figures show a growth of only 7 % during the first three months of 2015.
"If the growth of last year is compared with the figures of 2000, it is clear that the growth will be adjusted over time," said the main editor of the IMRG, Andy Mulcahy, to Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, the online trade accelerated three years ago when consumers took on mobile purchases.
"That made it possible for more and more to buy from the network, and for many, it was possible to buy in different environments, even with homemade hands.
As mobile production is more moderate now, growth can be balanced."
A black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is considered as one of the reasons for slowing down growth.
According to experts, the last Friday of November may make consumers postpone the purchase decision before black Friday.
Last year, a five-fold number of online buyers compared to normal made many traders' websites fall.
Experts believe that black Friday, which makes consumers want to go after the offers, can control the demands for shopping during the rest of the time.
According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, a fair pound per £5 was consumed online.
More than a third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased in online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of shopping streets.
In the Mekka, the victims are buried, the Bin Laden family's responsibility.
The Muslims wore 29 victims' bodies on the streets when the first funeral was held in Mekka.
According to Saudi Arabia, the large construction company Saudi Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the crane fell.
The bodies were worn in high air when Muslims gathered together to bury the 29 victims of the riot that fell over the Great Mosque of Mecca
In the streets, a number of white - dressed people had gathered together to say goodbye to the victims on their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The turbulence went to a pilgrimage where the crashed building shopkeeper had only been penetrated a day earlier through the mosque roof on Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia demands the family company of Bin Laden in the construction sector to be responsible for the accident where 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 victims who died in the Mecca Great Mosque accident were transported on the streets.
Among the deceased dead, Qasim Akram from Bolton of the Great Manchester, who had traveled with Mecca’s first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Great Mosque with his parents, who were beginning their annual parishing trip.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have promised that there will be a banquet of parish when thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for a pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, the Binladi Group should not have left the cranes up when the cranes were not used.
According to the Arabic press release, the Binladi Group is responsible for the accident.
However, according to the English bulletin, the group's management is prohibited from leaving the country.
Previously this week Salman promised to expose what caused the fall of the crane in the yard of the Great Moslems. Thousands of Muslims are headed to the Great Moslems for the break-up later this month.
The Binladis Group has not published a report on the accident and no representatives of the group have been sought for the opinion.
The king also accused the group of failing to comply with the current safety rules and co-operate with meteorology experts.
Ten nostrils are surrounded by Mekka's Big Mosque as part of the huge construction project of the Binlad Group.
The Bin Laden family has had close contact with the Saudi Arabia ruler family for decades, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for a number of major construction projects.
Al Qaida's deceased leader Osama bin Laden was apostasy son whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
Only a few days before the pilgrimage of Mekka, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in life, occurred in a severe rain and hard wind.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital care.
The authorities ordered to pay a million rioles (EUR 250 000) to the victims’ relatives and permanent injured persons.
The other victims of the accident will receive half of the amount of compensation.
According to the B&Q boss, cheap Eastern European labour is behind this phenomena.
British hire home generals more often, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been increased by skilled, professional workers from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix shops for workers are opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Head correspondent, Daily Mail
It is said that the British will move home hammering and painting work to the authors coming from Eastern Europe.
Sacrifice and painting skills seem to be scarce today.
Nowadays, the British are increasingly hiring household generals to carry out the home nincarnation work, says the manager of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is a new CEO at Kingfisher, who owns the house’s renovation store chain. According to Laury, this phenomenon is based on professional workers coming from Eastern Europe that provide services at low prices.
As a result of this, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new screwfix sales for traders. At the same time 60 B&Q sales are closed.
Laury needs more female power for B&Q stores, because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by a woman.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, the trends in the population need to be taken into account, as more and more women living alone today are renovating their homes.
"The staff of our shops is still the majority of men," says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the five women who are at the back of the companies of the British FTSE 100 index, and has also reorganized the corporate board so that men and female leaders are equally.
Kingfisher is almost the only one in its quality, since equally 50% of its staff are women, including the Managing Director and the Financial Director.
"This was a conscious decision, diversity is an important topic for us," Laury told me.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women in the board."
Kingfisher's operating and sales figures for six months have a fall, even though the company's hardest work was done after the sale.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and intends to open 200 new shops.
The government of the three aces decided to use mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The apparent effects were made quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAC and other employees' centres began to force the country immediately, and as a result, the country will stand on Friday due to a wide demonstration of employees.
A lot of people think that there will also be reason.
Let's see if it's worth striking when it goes bad anyway.
Even the resistance has been established.
More than 50,000 people have already visited online to report that they are not going to participate in a mental expression but are going to work.
In an old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet to protest, but openly declared as a contemporary would have been a political suicide of a small person.
Millions of trade unions, some ten thousand people's protests don't take much time, but it gives reason to think.
The position of the trade union is no longer as self-evident as yet, 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the fascination of the Ay movement, the brutal solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift of the sky.
As things have seemed to be rolling on their own weight for years, the unions now finally have access to the matter, i.e. the rights of the worker, to defend, visibly and properly.
This may allow the government to imprison the role of the Ay movement when membership in the trade union is seen perhaps more necessary.
Whatever the organizations think of, it's stupid that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has already declined 31 months in success.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment is rising.
These things are supposed to force everyone's heads.
High savings for the University of Lappeenranta: targeting 8.5 million savings, reduction of staff by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranta starts a savings cube aimed at obtaining a total cut of costs of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start the whole of the staff consultations with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means a reduction of approximately 130 employees.
In addition, the aim is to save two million other activities.
The Core Negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which is anticipated to have a deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also influenced by the government’s financial cuts.
In this financial year, the university will deliver about 2.6 million deficit results.
The cost will increase slightly for next year, but at the same time, the funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is approximately EUR 85 million, which means that the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between massive education and research cuts and the reduction in corporate funding to our university is very important, says principal Anneli Pauli in the university newsletter.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed to be even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears to be in new dimensions.
Negotiations with trust men will be launched next week on Tuesday and will last for the six weeks prescribed by the law.
Hole: Lucky wants for Finnish railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the biggest British rail transport companies, Souter says.
Rail transport is to be gradually opened to competition.
The first of these is close transport in the capital region in 2017-2018.
After close transport, there is a shift in district transport.
Souter says he's already approaching the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the plans of Lucky.
At least Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe, has announced its interest in other international companies in rail transport.
Time of interest rate decision by the U.S. Central Bank
The whole world will follow the United States Central Bank Fed meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on a possible increase in interest rates for the first time to almost a decade.
A fair half of the economen, which were still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates, now argue that the central bank would maintain the current interest rate of 0% to 0.25%, as shown by Reuters 80 economic scientists.
"This is a historical situation, because the central bank has kept the interest at zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus start the normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior researcher of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has been relatively good, and recovery has brought a balance of billions of extra dollars to the balance sheet and has only accelerated inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation that is not equally rose.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is to be published on Thursday at 20.00 A.M.
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before a colleague was shot later on the same day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he apologized for the first murder and hopes to cancel it, the authorities reported on Tuesday.
At the Mississippi Gautier, Delta State University, Lamb instructing math and social science called an emergency number about 10 a.m.
Monday, he told me he shot a man.
Lamb asked the police to come home on an emergency call.
"I shot my wife last night," said Lamb, and she also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, and there's no trouble with anyone but probably scared.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Also, Lamb didn't tell me the motive for shooting.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, a message written by the body and by Lamb, saying: "I am very sorry, and I hope I could cancel my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to Delta State University, where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt of history before he took his life late on Monday when the police hit him.
Principal William LaForge told me that he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lamb was clearly troubled by something.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb was supposed to believe that Prentiss was in a romantic relationship with Schmidt, but on Tuesday the authorities reported that there was no knowledge or evidence of the triangle.
For seven years, Shawn O'Steen, married to Prentiss, described his former wife as a good person.
The couple had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O' Steen told me that she and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
According to the man, the daughter and mother were the best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss Lindsay Knowles told me that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog called Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," said Knowles.
According to the police, Lamb had called his relatives during Monday and told them he wasn't going to jail.
When the police reached Lamb Highway 1 near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled his foot, ran into the woods and took his life.
According to the résumé on the University website, Lamb received a doctoral degree in education at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Reduced stars
The last few years have been difficult for an actor (in the picture of his left son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs and was arrested for possession of drugs in 2008.
Everything that happened has really demanded its tax.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw side for months due to two fractures.
Luke Shaw's right foot broke in the Manchester United Champion League fight against PSV Eindhoven.
But Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the fields in this season.
The 20-year-old Shaw was injured in a bad trap in the PSV defense area of Hector Moreno when the game was running for fifteen minutes.
Shaw got an emergency in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw's got two fractures on his leg, and he's in hospital care," Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or over tomorrow for surgery to Manchester.
The young man joining Manchester United's lines at 18 years of age has experienced hard experience and is now injured after the great playouts.
In the suit, Shaw was given oxygen.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when my leg breaks on two sides, he's on the side for six months and he's not playing at the block stage anymore.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno seemed to have reached a small extent when the situation did not follow a red card for the penalty.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian court has made a mistake.
"You may find yourself, but I think the situation was worth the punishment and a red card.
It was a two-foot jack."
Shaw's tweaked, "Thank you all for your messages, and I can't tell you how devastated I am, and I'm getting back stronger."

The defendant of England has a special reason to recover in order to race for the European Championship in France in June.
"It has a very bad injury," said the PSV coach.
"In such cases of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
Players never aim to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his legs when he played in the line of Mexico, the Netherlands was not until the 2014 World Championship.
"He is very sorry, because his purpose was not to harm the opponent. It is a shame to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
I only saw the ball that was going in the other direction, so it seemed that he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's tack."
"I know how it feels, and I know how difficult this may be," Moreno said to SBS6.
"I feel really bad, I'm so sorry."
The PSV Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after the crash with Chris Ssamling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Sooner or later, each parent will see that the child learns its favorite book from the outside.
Except to see David Cameron.
When the children’s holiday organization asked Cameron to designate her favorite children’s books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, the environmental story of Dr. Seuss published in 1971.
In a text published on the SuperCamp website, Cameron writes that it was difficult to choose. "Tarina is fun, touching and creative, and it has a powerful message. I like to read it to my children because there is always a picture or message that we haven't noticed before."
That sounds good, except that the next point in which Cameron is intended to describe the design of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to complete the initial text.
"In the city of Tarville, where the real trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is a commercial goods, there is a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of Audrey's dreams by making this greatest dream: to see the right tree," the text says. In the 1991 version of Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, Ted, had no object of pleasure.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly in line with the Lorax film compilation on the Internet Movie Database. It starts as follows: "In Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, there is a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of Audrey's girl's dreams."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the book plot would be so strange to him. Genie Kerskanen destroys wood and produces them Needs, despite the opposition of the name of the horizon, Lorax is a small and thick, thick creature that protects the forests.
It is likely that such a small, meaningful pre-development has been entrusted to the assistant, apparently to someone who hasn't read Lorax 20 times in the pipe when he was a child.
A representative of the Prime Minister said that the text is probably from the office of the Cameron Electoral District.
SuperCamps did not comment further but confirmed that the text was the handwriting of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the British team, but it's still hard.
Pakistan's encounter in the Combined Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when we see the last 3-0 test series of losses on the English tour, it is not expected to be repeated.
I wouldn't close the host win.
Alastair Cook's side may be more inexperienced than a three-year-old team, but the team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they have no bad experiences from 2012, just younger positive.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a cruiser, and Adil Rashid, although he has no experience at Test level, represents an attack option.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is clearly difficult for me to understand his principal coach in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been two good attacks under challenging circumstances, and simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best voters.
A few 50-point fights would've kept Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire with more runs.
The British principal coach, Trevor Bayliss, also commended his attitude when he wasn't as good as he could have been, which doesn't surprise me, but he's primarily a team player.
The question of how long the Test fighter will have the opportunity to impress, is difficult.
Lyth received seven landings — as his predecessor, Sam Robson — while Nick Compton received nine.
Compton was the only one who got the chance for both home and guest fights.
The only subject of complaint may be that England used Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean — when Lyth was in top condition — but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales comes to the team, and he's a hitter I appreciate.
He's a cricket player of an unknown author, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he did 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course this depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea is that Moe will start a strike with Cook, which brings an extra cruiser into the game while holding four fast eaters, and I am not against the idea.
I don't see a barrier that the peak eater could be hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown to be a great cricket player.
Moe may not have had much in his local team at Worcestershire, but he has been a team three player, and that is not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test game as the first substitute player before he was able to start in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is an accomplice in the team, and on the basis of what I've seen from him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can view his statistical figures — on average 31 points as a hitter and 35 feeders — and this can be a search shooter, but not much of the cruisers have shown that they are ready, and the voters decided to take a young player.
He learns a lot during this fight.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a couple of intelligent choices for his training staff.
The appointment of a Sri Lankan hitter, Mikeke Jayawardene, as a consultant for the Test games, can be a doorway.
This is one of the most delicious men of the species who brings with him a lot of experience because he has played against all kinds of attacks and circumstances.
Paul Collingwood comes to the part of the white ball and brings both energy and gracelessness.
I think he has always influenced the right international cricket, whether his role is a player or coach, and, like Mahela, he has a useful intelligence.
Sometimes a new sound in the dressing room, even though it would say the same thing as before, may be a stimulating injection.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has been resting in one day's fights, Root got a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and constituents do not determine the timetable for the game.
And we must bear in mind that, like the players, their job depends on the results.
These decisions will never be made unconsidered.
The Brexit Camp can win if the economy is in a bad mood 2017
David Cameron's halfway renegotiation strategy for staying in Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly deeper every day, even with no "yes or no" Corbynia's choice of the Labour Party or the TuC snatching Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyn and Nigel Faragne.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is, although not everyone is doing its own thing, some of the Member States are tired of the UK's self-sufficiency agenda, which includes differential concessions and harmful changes to the Treaty, which they really do not want.
In Brighton, the annual TUC Congress decided that they would not like it in the EU if it deteriorates social security.
We could call it Dave and George a selfie agent.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Alliance are hanging around at summits and bilateral negotiations in the main cities of different countries, catching a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-level people, returning home and telling them they've acquired allies for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to have an open-looking Britain inside the EU tent. "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says and proposes that more and more short-looking ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point that we don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's considering sensible Chancellor of the Alliance is a ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it is defiled, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland has a re-selection or the choice of a successor in 2017.
His power is sinking, too.
Poland will soon have a nationalist right government, while in Spain there will be a left-hand government.
It is hard to imagine that they will be inclined to help the selfies who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they do not want that because most people have separatist powers.
Some of these ministers can deliberately cast useless comments into the style of the Scottish National Party in the United Kingdom 2017 public election campaign to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation negotiations were organised, and there was nothing left in Britain about the renegotiation negotiations."
Europeans know how the British press catches and how the EU-sceptic oligarque press is, just like Tony Benn's referendum in 1975, which was in favour of 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Perhaps someone will remember in a distance from Boris Johnson, a sculpture-like European opportunist, who became known to be our direct correspondent for bananas in the EU in the early 90s in Brussels.
At least Ed Milibald knew his enemy.
These include taxes circumventing, hacking phones and seemingly temporary housing, which hold most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought about them mostly the same way, but then he realized that when you're in a cage with a gorilla, you need to hand over the bananas as a blunder so that the gorilla doesn't eat you for lunch and dinner.
The Miliband was also more blasted by Blair in opposition to the referendum, and Blair accepted the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the referendum 2005, she was able to do so.
The press never forgived him either.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly hit me in the Westminster on Monday, I told him that he had no more time to waste on me, and there may be a danger that he would take Neil Kinnock's media-boying strategy from the '80s, and that was a mistake and it's still a mistake.
It may take time, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy for dating with the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, whose BBC sofa he sat on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn on Europe is what we politely call building.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
The majority of people outside Ukip and Tory are likely to respond in a yes.
That's what Hilary "Benn's but Bennite" Benn told on the radio and television this week, when his internal patrol boy tried not to admit that Corby had a bad bet to appoint John McDonnell as a shadow state minister.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father had difficulty being loyal to his Labour party groups on television without going too far and losing his place in the lower room.
Hilary's troubles were more interesting.
Mr Benn said that he was opposed to staying in the EU under all circumstances. McDonnel did not say that either to his colleagues and members of the sub-committee at a private meeting on Monday night.
Your desire for Corby to care about whatever image of a sucker, must be remembered that he even touched me. The messenger is important in the 24/7 period, especially in the discipline of social media, where paranoia and fraud are inflicted.
Cameron does not need to be given a free passport for the EU, which would allow him to consider the support of Labour as a self-declaration in the referendum, as Mr McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins, at least that's what he thinks.
McDonnell and Corbyn's evacuation of EU membership is suitable for the bannite archipelago economy and the anti-capitalism past. Discussions are no longer only a small area of left-wing dissidents for whom the idea of combining similarity is a key lesson in doctrinal cranes.
Tom Watson is irrational in the fact that Corby didn't campaign for leaving, and foreign diplomats have to try to clarify it to their homes.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, and they have doubtful voters, and why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be for nothing?
The United States has already been pretty disappointed in the British miserable military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the early surgery of the Tory Government, which I received a reminder on Monday in connection with the British Influenza Security Forum.
Experts criticise the British Authority's opinions on electric cigarettes
According to researchers, the allegations of a state-funded plant that the smoking of electric cigarettes is 95 % less harmful than traditional smoking were generated at a meeting of 12 participants with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticised the evidence presented in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal in Public Health England (PHE) report on electric cigarettes.
PHE described its report published last month as a "reverse and comprehensive review of the results".
However, a number of researchers have questioned the certainty of data and raised the link of some experts with the tobacco industry.
Lancet Medical Journal's main writing last month included a "small-ass hip foundation" based on the most important conclusion of PHE.
In addition, two researchers have considered in the BMJ whether the claims were established for the "good or sand".
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medical European Public Health Professor Martin McKee and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, Simon Capewell, have stated: "The basic presumption of public health is that the policies are based on a clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKeen and Capewell, the public assumes that the claim by PHE that "the current best estimate is that electric cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of the results of the research.
The claim of a single meeting of 12 people that was invited to build a model based on multi-target assessment (MCDA). The model wanted to harmonize the views of the participants on nicotine products. The results were summarised in the study.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the supporters of the meeting included, among other things, EuroSwiss Health, whose former independent investigation by the CEO has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT).
In addition, in the report on sustainable activities, the CEO supported BAT’s public health activities.
One of the 12 participants of the meeting granted funding from the electric sulphur manufacturer. However, the previously claimed funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not granted by that participant.
The selection criteria of the panel formation have not been analysed; however, there are a number of well-known supporters of electric cigarettes, some of which are admitted to their participation as an industrial fundor.
However, some participants are not familiar with their expertise in the fight against smoking.
PHE’s tobacco respondent also attended the meeting.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the study report of the group reveals that there is no undisputable evidence of the detrimentality of the products with regard to a wide range of products and the fulfilment of their criteria.
However, there are no links or shortcomings mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, no evidence has been provided so far that electric cigarettes can promote smoking for children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim to be premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, responsible for health and well-being, said that the claims have been answered in the past.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are considerably less harmful than traditional smoking.
Each one of the people who smoke through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are lower than traditional tobacco risks, but long-term effects need to be investigated more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in situations where the relative risks are unclear compared to traditional tobacco.
In the United Kingdom there are nearly 80 000 deaths per year related to smoking, and smoking costs for public health care costs of two billion pounds per year.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the current evidence that electric cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but that they are a fraction of the effects of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Chancel 4 boss.
Luke Johnson, who was head of Channel 4, said that the BBC should stop sending certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand on the hotlines, such as the soap series Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should only be used for programmes that other television stations do not make.
He criticises the presentation of programmes likely to be smaller than the public at the same time as the large viewers' viewers' programmes, as well as, for example, the BBC4 channel.
After the BBC president Tony Hall had announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he had been trying to get a Channel 4 channel to cooperate with the BBC for six years, without results.
"I do not agree with the idea that BBC is buying formats and sending programmes that would be clearly part of the software of a competitive channel," Johnson told the Committee on Communications in Parliament, which explained the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep a broadcasting fee, which, in my opinion, is not necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should at least reduce its supply for programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
BBC sends The Voice to the best viewing time, because it wants the best possible support in the future.
If there's no other channel, it's clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could be financed without subsidies," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders the other, even though it is its own production.
A lot of channels would give me their right hand on it.
I don't understand how this serves the service of the broadcaster.
I don't think this would be a loss to BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was headed by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010. He believes that BBC collects good viewers because the company works with ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson’s comments on the BBC’s most popular series are similar to the former Sky boss Tony Ball, who suggested in 2003 that BBC sells series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the programs for the BBC niche general are shown on the BBC4 channel, where audiences are often not measured, but the programs meet their purpose. "BBC can say, in defending hypocrites, four billion pounds of pounds of universal broadcasting, they did not have any special programs that no one looked at."
"BBC presents them at a time when no one ever sees them."
Johnson said, "I want you to find another system that's just as old-fashioned as it is, that who gets the best of it.
Everyone, of course, thinks that 150 pounds a year are cheap, but people for whom it is a big sum, especially if they don't look at the BBC exactly."
David Elstein, former director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, who also mentioned his own views in committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should change its ancient mission to the new 'information, teaching and entertainment'.
According to Elstein, the present offer of BBC is hardly available – 1 per cent on television and 0.1 per cent on the radio. He adds that the BBC should learn from Australia and Canada’s broadcasters and give its mission a new belief: "information, illuminate and entertain".
On the question of cooperation, Elstein proposes that BBC could increase broadcasts, for example, from events such as Proms Festival, whose concerts were sent last year only a fraction. "BBC should also join alliances with commercial channels so that the full supply is also available online," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how the shuttle worm turns in its direction when it is targeted with ultrasound.
Researchers have raised worms whose nervous system has been genetically transformed, so worms can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small shuttles change their directions when they are targeted with an ultrasound with a frequency above the ear area of the human ear.
The sound waves activate motion nerve cells that are genetically modified with a transport membrane that reacts to ultrasound.
Add to the topic: Researchers follow the brain activity through light
According to researchers, worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics). In the process, the ultrasound is used to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells with an stimulus from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, an investigator of Salk Instute in La Jolla, California, told Guardian that one day the method can replace deep brain stimulation (DBS).
But my Chalasa discovered that the worms begin to react when they were placed in a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, bubbles intensify ultrasound waves that progress into worms.
Strengthened ultrasound waves affect TRP4 ionics, which are part of worm cell membranes.
According to a article published in the Nature Communications, sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate cells attached to them.
In order to control the shuttle surfaces with an ultrasound Chalasani transformed worms genetically so that they had a TRP4 ionic tubes that led their movement.
When the ultrasound was turned to the modified carpets, the microcouples reinforced the sound waves and switched to the mats, and the nerve cell triggered the signal.
The method reminds me a little bit of optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool to enable researchers to activate nerve cells through light.
According to Chalasan, however, sonogenetics have certain advantages compared to optogenetics.
Light is directed to the brains targeted by light fibres. Low-grade ultrasounds, instead, pass through the cell easily, so the ultrasound can be redirected to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that genetic therapy and viral therapy can allow human nervous cells to be immediately exposed to ultrasound signals in a clinical environment in certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and in insulin-producing cells.
Illegal Torture — Your Home Door!
Advertising is a shame for British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International's anti-defense video.
Scary killer missiles!
They're breaking ankles!
Fruit bombs!
Telegrams that cause intolerant pain but do not leave traces!
The happy voice and drawings clearly reveal that this advertisement of the world's largest stations is a barode. The video is produced by Amnesty International and is designed to highlight the British government's attempt to sell weapons to repression governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International), which is held at the ExCel Centre in London.
Add to the topic: DSEI station fairs: authoritarian administrations arrive in London
In the bus stops and subway wagons, posters are also sealed, demanding a second look.
" Important announcement: are you moving on the metro from 15 to 18.9.?" The announcement reminds us of the signs of the London Metro. At the end of the metro line, there is a picture of the tanker on the other side.
"In September, a bunch of arms dealers will arrive in Docklands, and customers will be asked for help to abolish the arms fairs."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists whose work was performed at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collector named Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters around London with a six-pound "acquisition package" worth six pounds of commercial space, with six-digit keys that claim to reach about one-third of the world’s ad posters in bus tanks.
Transport for London is not a joke of postervandalism.
One of the pilgrimages of the Special Patrol Group.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and the lecturer at the University of Essex, Gavin Grindon, artists have started to question things and want to bring their political work to the public outside the gallerys.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires the introduction of art into the real world, and many are moving to work with Protestant activists.
One of the anti-arm trade posters welcomes the users of public transport in the metro.
Amnesty's video has been viewed on Facebook over 100 000 times a day. It has been designed without compensation by VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the multiplier have also done their work without compensation.
Matt Lever, the artistic director of the VCCP, crawled with the absence of the fair advertising and an empty spot at the ExCeL event calendar, and said, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were trying to get a more realistic, blurred business video, but bright colors and animations are more attracting attention."
"They have done a wonderful job and helped us to raise up the fairs of illegal torture equipment," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
"The government must now take action and ensure that torture equipment is not unlawfully traded by our home doors."
However, perhaps the most creative antique of the stations is displayed in the exhibition halls in ExCeL, where the exhibitors use vague orchestra expressions of their trade.
In his press release, Saab reported an order made by the U.S. Army concerning the "exportable AT4CS RS".
The product includes "a specially shaped combat carpet that effectively penetrates directly into the target".
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for students' homes
I moved into the student home 11 years ago, and I was 19 years old innocent and still believed in barets and moral relativism, and I remember only now the crowded smiles I've irritated, and the countless, long complaints of others.
The most important teachings can be summarised in eight simple rules.
In the least, moving to the apartment is a stressful experience and is shocking at the worst.
The situation begins to shave easily: you tell everyone where you are, do you like the middle year and why you don't like Corby and why you don't "love or hate Marmite, because it's just shiny, hahahhah, I'm in my room."
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others to breathe: show your interest and ask others questions.
Questions lead the conversation and help you find people you like and people you wouldn't even talk to when your sleeves were in flippers and these people would share the shutters.
Give the rest of us some space.
Their own rooms often serve as drinking dishes, cinema theatres and public accommodation centres, but their own room is also a place where they are dressed from underwear.
More topic: Don't even imagine combining dating and university studies
For introverts, the university is a tough place.
The own room should be a sedated place. However, many homes form a social culture that moves from room to room and create lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place of recovery.
In this environment, it is not possible to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can recharge the energy I used to date with you."
Try to find out if one of your college mates is exhausted from social contact, perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my own student home who thought the unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your study properly when baking is in, so if you knock on someone's doors, you don't seem like a 50-century, a little strange, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've made you something small. Smile when I'm sneaking about your personalities."
Homemade desserts are a great way to get new friends.
Your college partner has to talk to you, and it's a good surprise that they can stay with a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires reasonable baking skills.
If you serve unhappy crackers of flour, sugar and fat, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Food snacking is also a general failure in student housing.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can you put a drop of tea in someone else's milk cans?
Always make sure of the milk cans from the owner.
You'll probably get a license, even if the milk quote would be the owner of the jar.
I understand that it is annoying if someone tries something from you, but still try to handle the situation as adult as possible — unlike my own student partner, who put the washing material in his milk as punishment for milk thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't make noise when others try to sleep or punk.
It's not just because it's polite, but it's also worth remembering that whoever digs the other hole...
In my own apartment, a girl asked the resident of the room next door to set the steep of music down, for it was three o’clock in the morning, and she had a exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When I finally shut up in the next room, she let the neighbor sleep for two hours. She left for three hours to test, left the music to cut her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would happen to move to the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be strange if you thought first that your college mate would be your future partner, would you start dating, breaking up, and you'd have to see him every day and lose the right to meet your friends together for him?
If a college partner is definitely not the only right one, try to control it.
If you notice in the moment that someone has forgotten their keys in a room whose door is not locked, the boundary of the trick and bullying is vaguer than you could think.
Good joke's funny, but one that's gonna be all right in a minute.
It may be valuable and fun to hide a object, but no room should be messed with toothpaste and shampoo.
The door of the other room can be locked and dropped in a water glass, which is placed in a freezer, but do not attach any of the items on the ceiling a few times more.
A racist attack on the property of foreign students at Kite - a house designed for reception centre was strangled in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack on Kite in North Karelia was carried out at the foreign students' home.
Unlike the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation facilities of minor asylum seekers, but the bedrooms of foreign students who have been in Finland for longer time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher of Kiteen Evangeline Public School.
The windows and walls of the faculty of accommodation facilities were strangled with racist signs, such as razorists, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one accommodation facility, says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, as a responsible teacher of the social guarantee education of young people at the National University, there were estimated ten people at the time of the attack in the building that was vicious.
"It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some could have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
The National University has accommodationd people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All the people in the contaminated building have a status.
Parts study in adult basic schools, part in professional studies, and part study Finnish," Luukkainen says.
The ‘A’ status is a so-called permanent residence permit, which can be issued for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The East Finland police are investigating the attack as damage and a violation of the domestic peace.
According to Luukkain, a press conference was held for students on Monday, including the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had 20 years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens," Luukkainen says.
I'm telling you, the messengers have already been cleaned out of the walls.
As a suspect, there were at least three men and they had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the head of the youth weekend when this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luukkainen says.
Salo has also been drilled to a hospital where a reception centre has been designed.
The case happened last week.
This was reported on the MTV website on Tuesday night.
The wall of the hospital was carved and written in English "You are notwelcome".
We've got a criminal report on this case.
Revision 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected malfunctional data provided by the police about the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will abolish the Y-jun for Karjaa, the passengers in their asses, the "she's an idiot's country"
The Y-train from Helsinki to the Karjaa of Rasepor ceases to travel in March.
The news insulted passengers on the Helsinki main railway station from the beginning of the train in the beginning of the afternoon.
In particular, the sweep hits the wings, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's just an idiot, because the number of inhabitants is growing all the time, and those who work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be up to anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says HSTV's interview video is going to the main city on a tractor.
Train changes also take place elsewhere in New Zealand.
The H and R trains on the main path are combined with a new R line.
Purola's position in Lake Head and Punch City in Tususula remain out of service.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes from which the Ministry purchases train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period is changing in year-to-year and the routes to be terminated are in the country as a whole.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will later be adopted by the Monetary Committee.
The Siuntian Bengtström believes that the state train cutter is a short-looking operation.
We make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and are repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there'll be regret.
Y trains are also used by non-raceporians and civics because it is fast and crosses multiple stations.
Annina Pöyry, from Espoo, was deeply affected by the destiny of travellers on the train to the city area.
"It's very bad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said when he was in pain on the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
There is probably a new train connection to the beach, which will replace the Y-juna in the region of the Region of Helsinki (HSL), i.e. leading to the Church.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately assess the costs.
Rihtniemi says that HSL has paid the Y train about a million years, based on the number of passengers, the Ministry certainly paid much more than that.
The R-line on the main track leaves two stations.
Instead, in Ainola and Saunakallio, the number of train ranks is doubled.
A total of 28 small stations and a number of routes end from the whole country.
The Ministry is no longer buying train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki- Wallfahrt.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to the route Pieksämäki-Varkus.
Train ranks are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaan-Oulu.
More than half a million travels per year are made in late shifts, with around nine million travels purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring savings of 12.3 million annually to the State.
The value of the agreement is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the Book "The Modernity of Capital" "You should learn about Marx"
World economic crises have raised Karl Marx (1818-1883) and, in his 1867-1894 conclusion, writes the actuality of Marx's capital, known as former president of the GDP, in the book Yrj Hakanen published today.
"He's being taken more seriously than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his predecessor.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, the internationalisation and infiltration in all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money and imaginary capital have proved to be surprisingly far-reaching.
The book writer list organised by Hakase also provides a professor at the Aalto University, a highly respected economic operator Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes Marx is a topical "new and forever".
But isn't the former Managing Director of the Research Institute for Business and Business delegation Marxian?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not consider Marx a topical economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theory.
Nowadays, social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary lessons.
"The usual idea is that the history of the atheist tells the wrong opinions of dead men," Krkman starts.
It's true that Marx's prophecies went very wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he draws too far from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman is considering.
But Korkman sees the value of the radical positioning of Marx.
"The more relevant part of Marx is that she asked some good questions," she says.
We are discussing again Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of a technical turbulence," Korkman analysis.
But what the government should decide tomorrow isn't helping Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Still, it's worth getting familiar with Marx.
"In the '70s Marx couldn't read," says Korkman.
"The Maoris and the Troths and the other secs hated all capitalism, but even more each other."
Today the debate is more versatile and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political mass load of the years back.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like other classics," Korkman says.
United Nations demands war criminals in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the Sri Lanka Civil War, reports the news agency AFP.
The UN report on the Civil War in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames war crimes on both the Sri Lankan Armed Forces and Rebels known as Tamil Tigers.
In the Sri Lanka Civil War, at least 100 000 people are estimated to die.
Even the number of victims is unknown.
In particular, in the last months of the long-term war, the major attack of the armed forces should be properly investigated, and the UN report requires.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report blames for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which were as likely victims as men and women.
According to the report, the rebels are guilty of forced bysiders and children to fight fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but is not going to allow the establishment of the United Nations Court of Justice because of foreign judges.
In England's yo's experiment, the social media was weighed
On Wednesday, a long foreign language, most of which had English, was included in the autumn’s academic writings.
England's skills were tested for over 16,000 experiments.
The experiment could have written a substance on social media.
On the basis of our own experience, it was necessary to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of 150-250 words in English could point to the advisor of the web magazine.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is the Finnish Legia rest chair.
He had to be asked how his parents should look at things for young people too.
There were four subjects of the substance, one of which had to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them," estimates the third topic of Porvoo's Swedish-language high school, Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was only a citaat from the former President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso.
And the fourth subject, Lybeck, said it was pretty nice.
There was to be a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"In our school, we've always been practicing the writing of speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment as normal.
In the Finnish - or Swedish - experiment, English could answer the questions of texts, such as adaptation to climate change and handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles continue on Friday, which is the next test of another domestic, Swedish, or Finnish, or Finnish.
The test is normally organised in the upper secondary schools, meaning that it is not affected by the demonstration of employees.
The college board invites students to find appropriate travel connections in time so that they can get to the test event.
If you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence, you may also have time.
The store was robbed with a gun in Oulu.
In Oulu, on Wednesday morning, the store was robbed in the clock district.
According to the police, the robber had been dressed with dark clothes and a face-covered commando.
The man is normal and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened his staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money to capture.
They're investigating it as a dirty robbery.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of demonstrators in Helsinki - support teams from elsewhere in Finland
The protesting expression of mind against the decisions of the Board of Directors will stop the center of Helsinki on Friday, predicting the police.
Preliminary information indicates that there are up to tens of thousands of people.
The members of the SAK, Aka and STTK Association will meet at the Railway Envoy at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration of mind.
In turn, the police at work are not only responsible for carrying out the alerts and other police activities, but also for ensuring the smooth functioning of the giant expression.
Roads leading to the railway station are closed from motor vehicles for the period from 9.30 to 14.
All we have to do is get the alarm vehicles in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the edge of the Caesaniemi traffic circle, from the west direction of the Mannerheim.
Is it enough for people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand on the police's work fights.
According to Kujala, Helsinki is on its way from other countries in Finland because of the expression of mind.
The police aren't telling us the exact patrol officer.
"There's a little coming, but we're usually gonna be fine with ourselves," Kujala says.
Police urges to avoid private caring in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst transport radius extends from the level of Hakaniemi to the nuclear center.
Standing traffic is expected from morning to morning.
With protesters from elsewhere in Finland, Helsinki will also have a lot of order buses.
They won't be allowed to the Railway Envoy.
Buses are basically out of time.
The rest of the trip, then we have to walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The spirit expression also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the point of view of the police, this is a positive side.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at hand at these large gatherings of people, is now dealt with in part by itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that Helsinki may become tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policies.
The police are expecting the expression of mind to go smoothly.
People are ordinary or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, the Finnish people are rational and peaceful," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also held on Friday in Finland.
Friday's expression of mind is in many ways extraordinary. Do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The great expression of mind organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, it does not find a very good comparison in Finnish political history, says Emeritus Martti Sizilien, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's not a miracle that the Ay business protested.
If it didn't do that, it would raise hands in front of the government, the Sheilan says.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the Finnish tradition of corporateism, including those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard shots are missing in contract law.
There are a lot of features that ay-business is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not have any support for all employees to the minds of Friday.
The new is now the sharp division of which the expression of mind produces among those whose Ay-business would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from all over Finland showed their minds in the parliamentary house in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday's demonstration, it could be an unemployed giant applause, the Murrostorstai, organised in 1993, says Sicily.
In the middle of the deepest lama, the Murrostorstai gathered a total of 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (Central) government was disrupted from the labour market crisis to the other.
It was said that the Finnish government and the employees' organisations were never as bad as they were in the past during the Aho national government.
Now the government and the Ay-business are probably even worse than in Murrostorsta's time.
Besides, now Finland's very own government is ever in power, Sicily says.
The current coalition of government is still so interesting that it is so strictly right-wing, despite the speeches of the main Finns.
There were certain elements of the old workforce at the time of the steep.
A number of thousands of demonstrators are expected to be present on Friday.
Fascination also stops public transport and possibly closes day care and schools.
Although the expression of mind does not receive undistributed support for employees, it can become the largest for years.
In Helsinki, some 300 demonstrations have been organised annually in recent years.
There's a lot of them from the top to the bottom.
Traditionally, the Finnish Ay movement demonstrations have been quite peaceful, even though the practices have been tightened over the last few years.
Traditionally, a Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is lawful.
The speakers are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Sicily.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of interest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on them.
The strike of firemen lasted three months in 1998.
Among other things, the pilots and air traffic controllers had visible strikes.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical lakes in the 1970s
The most important strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men were involved in the metal men's strike.
The strike was suspended on a proposal from the Conciliation Board after seven weeks.
Metal men received a raise of 16%.
In the spring of 1977, the electrical strike lasted 49 days and caused electricity decay throughout the country.
Breakdown in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20 000 people, many unemployed in the lama, gathered to express their views on the job.
Firemen stabbed three months in 1998
The firemen's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
In 1994, the police faced eggs in the protests of farmers against the EU.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," one of the words of the attack.
For Espa, the farmers sniffed tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU summit in 1999 also allowed farmers to protest and burn haystacks in front of the meeting.
Nurses stabbed 1983 and 1995
For about a month, in 1995, the nurses stabbed.
For the last time, they had been in a strike in 1983.
In 1995 the strike was painted by a few deaths during the strike.
It threatened by the strike and the massacres of the nurses in 2007.
The threat of massacre has eventually accelerated the negotiations.
Doctors stabbed 2001
"Doctors in the strike - by the force," was one of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted for five months and resulted in an intense debate on how strikes could jeopardise patient safety.
After the lay, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students moving in 2013
Approximately 5 000 students marched for study support from Senatetor in Helsinki to the parliamentary house in 2013.
Central Crime Police to explore the background of a Finnish trunk full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for assistance in identifying the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It doesn't know if the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
They were all in good condition on the cold truck.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Research and main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, reports Captain Tero Haapala of Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in a truck in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on the ride were apparently strangled.
According to the public radio, the car belongs to the Finnish stock company, which first told the Austrian police about its cooperation.
The company, among other things, is conducting restaurant activities and its CEO is a foreign man, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqisists have been arrested for trafficking in human beings.
The ex-husband captain, the ex-drug criminal, and a squirrely businessman, the story of five smugglers.
A smuggling king, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a cab driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, such people carry out human trafficking into the European Union.
Criminalist Andrea Di Nicola at Trento University and journalist Giampaolo Musumec have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "clients", and their written book The Travel Office of Death will appear in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the hulls of human trafficking, present solutions and present smugglers from different ports of business.
HS will present five of them.
I'm gonna beat them out of their minds right now.
The Quarter Islands in the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading to the summer.
For their location, the islands are also excellently suited to smuggling, as the journey to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 km.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is approximately 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-fired captain and the father of six children.
The multitude islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fisherman is more profitable to carry people.
That's what Emir has done on a blue, ten-metre tree boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, 40 people can fit.
From one trip, Emir will earn around EUR 8 000 after the cost.
Emir's got five assistants looking for his clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape trouble during the Arabics.
Then the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis retreated.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as you can see it.
The food is given so that the customers are just and just survived.
The accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer is running out of money, that's their problem.
They're going to the water at midnight with an offset light.
The first night we drive off the islands, then stop, wait the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes seafare is hard, and in waves of 20 metres, passengers cry and puke.
At the end of the day, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour, and Emir is leaving for a return trip.
Emir wants to be scared.
That's why he fucks his clients, and at least he says he's gonna beat the bullies to death.
He says in the book that once a cop knocked him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I took one of my clients in one neck and threw them overboard," says Emir in the book.
The quietest passengers are coming south of the Sahara.
He said he'd have to abuse this.
I'm gonna beat them off right now.
We have to show them who's in charge.
It's just a regular cab driver.
Goran's a regular cab driver in Boskovaša in Serbia.
His cab isn't very good... the starter engine is pulling his last, and he's seen his best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the cab is moving and moving towards the Hungarian border.
Boskovasha is a small village with 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers south of Belgrade.
Behind the village is a centre for asylum seekers, which is mainly accessible to families.
In the forests around the centre, men traveling without their family will be accommodated in tents, crates and abandoned cars, which now has been able to find or build.
Families living in the woods are also families who have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia for a reason or another.
Some also stay in private housing, but it is a public secret.
Goran finds most of his customers in the forest.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of crossing borders and weeks of walking in difficult landscapes, often mountain areas and darkness.
At the end of the day, when they arrive in the Bovosha area, at the knot of a large human shipment, people are fatigue.
The Goran Cypriots are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say it once, and that's enough," Gora congratulates.
He says the Africans are trying to sting.
Goran doesn't like it.
You stupid fool on the whole trip.
At first, a price of EUR 300 will be agreed, for example, and then they will count it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran stresses that he's a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says that he is working cheaper than others and he only pays 50 euros per person on the Hungarian border.
There's a trip of three hundred miles, most of the highways are nicely.
I hear the colleagues are asking for a three- or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about €50,000 a year.
It's not a big sum for a smuggler, but it's a very nice yearly income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not be transported 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his rider a mile from the border.
Then he'll show his clients the right direction, and he'll squeeze away.
In the work of charitability
The 35-year-old congolism is called the Embassy Prisoner, and it's not just a favourite name.
He really has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, where many believers fleeed from Congo, as well as a small centre helping Congolese children.
In addition to preaching, the Embassy minister runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees that he is doing the work of mercy.
It's important to look good for ambassador.
He polishs his shoes several times a day and ensures that the rubber of white underneath the low belt of jeans is stylishly cured.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his terrace car and his three motorcycles.
When the missionaries do not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the client calls some of the five phone numbers of the Consignee.
He advises you to arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money in your whisper and smash in between the merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain asylum seeker or refugee status to the Uganda authorities, it is necessary to inform the authorities that they are from, for example, the war zones of North Kivu and that they have been forced to flee violence from their homes.
Often it is true, but if not, the Consignor will arrange a new identity for the client.
An old identity card will be destroyed and a second one will be replaced.
That's where the missionary's contacts at the Uganda Police Department helps.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers are going: the asylum procedure, NGOs, finally the UN Refugee Organisation UNHCR.
Ambassador knows bureaucracy because he himself has become a refuge in Uganda.
He pays separately for each port: the application to the Uganda police costs about EUR 100, the processing of documents to the humanitarian organisation around 150 and the migration process, for example, EUR 4 500 to 7 000 in a European country.
Folio and iceberries
Tom's an initiating smuggler, a former drug criminal.
A four-year-old Irish guard on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people on their way to Britain.
He helps with Afghanistan, a French cab driver and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know that they are in a human undercover transport business in London.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, from one of those near Calais Center.
They're driving the A26 highway and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stop the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years because of the drugs.
The cab stops, Tom and his clients run across the highway to the rest site where the drivers sleep before they continue to cross the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck... to make sure it's just on its way to England and not even to the Netherlands... and cut off a security guard.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's involved in the plan, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client into a aluminium foil, similar to the one wrapped in the kitchen around a buffet or a furnace.
It should stop the police's thermal scanner from detecting a hidden person.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place in the hope that he won't drive a sudden sniper before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Mummer Küçuk is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
The Upporitic Turks have been called marketing master and the unquestionable king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, governing maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, Küçuk has been working and has constantly developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has one competitive advantage in relation to other entrepreneurs: he demands the money only.
One of the new methods is luxurious: the Turkish ports are rented with a view to taking the American or European families for a few days of tourist rites.
In fact, ships will be loaded to a full-scale Syrian, Iraqi, Kurdish and Afghanistan, which will be transported against a payment of EUR 5 000 to 7 000, first from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe.
Customers will be kept in human storage, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People go to minibuses and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, we need to get on board quickly.
Passengers have to stay hidden all the way under cover.
The Marine Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of the human population.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers exhale and puke, the better.
Küçuk receives about EUR 53 000 from one luxury ship trip after costs.
He does not do practical things himself, but hire the captains, recruiters, guards, accommodations and other smaller agents to do the work for him.
During the summer, at least hundreds of transport will be carried out and Küçük earns millions.
He's supposed to buy undercovers through land, pharmaceutical business, and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Mummer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, apparently, he's gone.
Correction 16.9.2015 at 15.10 p.m.: The Travel Office of Death will appear here, not next week.
American Olympia drinks tell us in their book about their illness and becoming a prostitute
The new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1 500 - meter runner in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton says in his book Fast Girl about quitting his career and becoming a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career in Sydney's Olympics.
He came to the races at the top and ran out of the quarantines for the second best time.
But in the final, he was panicked.
At the beginning, he ran to the top and defended his leading position with a manic run.
But 150 metres before the goal, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed on the track surface, and the other competitors passed him one after the other.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
But I pushed myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later, it became apparent that Favor Hamilton was suffering from a bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before Sydney’s races, and he himself felt great prosperity.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when he became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
No financial problems in the barbecue, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with strange men.
He also overpaid his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury life.
One explanation by Favor Hamilton to become a prostitute was that he needed the same adrenaline spikes he had gained in his competition in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out he had a bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former astronomer appeared at the end of 2012 when the Smoking Gun published an article on him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was at 1,500 metres of world statistics at 3.57.40, but remained the last in the Sydney Olympic Final.
The world champion rejoiced when the alliance put Norway's ski flower under control: "Shortbacks"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of fitness, in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and Norway's Shipping Union have evacuated the whole summer and autumn, like last year, from a sports agreement.
Although the covenant has offered Northug a better deal than other sportsmen, it has not been good enough for the world champion and Olympic winner.
As a result of the agreement, the Norwegian Shipping Union decided to close Northug out of the world cup of the coming season.
The decision was made by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put the ski flower under control.
"Thank you for showing the backbone," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow an active athlete to avoid working in favour of a alliance sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian skiing Union and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously like to be part of a seasonal country team so that he could advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said that he was happy to represent a union that also cares for future generations and does not allow one athlete to take care of.
At the same time, he recalled that the covenant has given Northug financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb doesn't accept that one athlete has different rules than just because he's the best.
Northug published his own release on Tuesday, in which he assured him that he would like to be brave in Norwegian colors next season in the world cup as well as after that in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MMs, two of them golden.
Last winter in Falun, he was involved in a team that won the message gold.
The turtle day of the translators is also spent in the northern country.
On Turtle Day 25.9, we are organising concerts in different restaurants and shops for which the Shrink translators' shield has been awarded.
The goal of the day is to emphasise the high level of food skills in Finland and lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of the high quality.
At the same time, it is worth reminding that all high-level restaurants have not concentrated on the capital area, but the top restaurants checked and classified by a neutral operator are located throughout Finland.
The international attention received by the event is evidence of the importance of the event as part of increasing the sensitivity of turtle restaurants and organizations.
In the northern country, the day is held at Vaasa Restaurant in Foundation and Kantarelli.
At Kokkola, a restaurant in the Old Town is taking part in a turtle day.
The event has also received considerable international attention.
It is therefore decided to make the organisation one of the most important international events that will be held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-joki Magazine: The Chancellor of Justice appelled for the establishment of a Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up the LSK Business Park Oy, which is currently owned by the Kauhava Ex-Arrangement.
According to the complaint, the region remains permanently located in critical infrastructure in crisis times, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, the Finnish Erillis Networks Oy.
According to the Drugjoki magazine, the private person believes that the placement of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interest in the region and airport of the former Air War School, whose impact has also not been established in the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case states that in the last two years there have been negotiations on the organisation of air training and the outcome of a potential foreign operator on the airport.
This was discussed among other things with Minister of Defence, Jussi Niniston (ps.) and Secretary of State of Defence, Arto Rädy.
The private person notes to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a question of objection to the reception centre in principle, but of the fact that the planned place in the former garrison area is wrong.
The horrific city government dealt with the reception center last Monday.
Ninja: The situation in Syria reflects Ukraine and the Baltic Sea
The management means that there are the necessary conditions for immigrants and those who are here, Niinistu commented to the journalists in the evening after meeting the presidents of all parliamentary parties with their offices in Mäntyniem.
According to the president, the concern about the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland, the government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
The situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region, could also have an impact on the situation of Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
Solution is hopeful of the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, that is, the United States and Russia will be able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the tension in the Baltic Sea.
The NATO question was also ignored in the debates.
The President did not take a position on the situation on the labour market.
Finnair pours on Friday 16 domestic flights, Aleks close for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 Fridays.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia has been reported that the operations of the airports are being carried out by the commander during the occupation.

Fame closes the streets of the centre of Helsinki
The demonstration held on Friday closes the streets of the centre of Helsinki.
The police tell us that the streets leading to the Railway Station will be closed from the cars around 9:30-14.
From the direction of the Mannerheims, cars are not allowed to go to Kaivokatu, Postkatu or the Gulf Street to the railway station.
From the Union’s road to Hakanieme, transport will be directed to the Union’s street at the Caesaniemi Transport Circular.
According to the police, the closure time depends on the population involved in the demonstration.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed to enter the area.
Metro and cruise drivers throughout Friday's mind manifestation
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of the morning traffic to the end of night transport.
The Radiation and Metro staff Association told the STT this evening.
The majority of the primitives are closed for two hours, including posts closed
Friday's expression of mind also causes disruption of Post's services.
Significant delays are expected, among other things, for the distribution of daily mail.
Most of the postal service points are closed.
The blood transportation of the Finnish Red Cross is handled despite the strike.
The transport of food and the dispatch of hospitals and laboratory samples is also sought.
You can find information on the services on the Post website.
Most of the Finnish Origins close their doors on Friday for two hours.
The Services Trade Union Pam has instructed its employees to stop work between 11:00 and 13:00.
Pam has also called on day-to-day trade workers to participate in the demonstration of professional organisations.
Representatives of the SOK and Kesko will tell the Sanos of Helsinki that they are trying to keep the stores open, if necessary, by supervisors.
According to Kesko, there is still no information on the possible closure of individual shops.
The Helsinki Day Homes are partially closed
The Helsinki Day Homes do not work in full on Friday, inform the Helsinki Early Education Office.
Due to the expression of mind by professional organisations, daily treatment may be concentrated on certain day-care facilities, and no club activities of day-care homes and playgrounds will be organised.
Day homes and groups of children with disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of schoolchildren with disabilities and autists are normally organised.
The Early Education Office will be authorised to inform further changes to the activities tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipila, a wide range of channels is needed in communication, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
Such a direct channel of speech is also needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to the journalists in the parliament.
Sipila did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches become.
According to the Sipilah, talks may not always be dealt with in the future on Ylen channels.
If other channels sign up as a channel, then we'll see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the economic situation in Finland is so serious that it requires a TV and radio speech to the citizens.
This issue, which is being discussed here, is quite complicated and requires a further justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel. Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 in both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
The Sipilah takes a big risk.
The media investigator hopes that Sipilä’s television speech does not tell us more generally about turning in the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to make public debate more rigorously into their own hands and refuse to put up a public debate?
It reminds me of the recent comment of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and lets it define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not linked.
I understand that the commercial media is upset by Sipilha's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not reporting issues in democracy.
It is the role of media representatives to make a definite effort not to adopt political agendas when given.
According to the experience, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, the Sipilah should bring something new and special to the table so that the exceptionally high expectations of the talk can be met.
Is there more that we've already heard today?
Or is he able to speak in different terms, differently, or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if the permit has only the same old one, we must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
It is a risk to be taken in this sense, insofar as this is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle is stamped as a mediator of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in accordance with Yle's interests or the public line.
A sleeve-squeeze bet
In the forthcoming speech of Sipila, what the Prime Minister leaves a message is also important, the media researcher stresses.
At night, we need to look closely at what Sipilla is missing and what she does not, says Heikki Six, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the Sixth, the TV speech is a clever bet from Sipila, because this is how it can bring its own view out of no voices.
This gives the message a general public without a journalistic filter, unlike at an information meeting where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä skips the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, the danger is that the media misinterpret something about the speech because there are no specific questions to be asked.
According to the six, it's very important how Sipilla appears on TV... if it's sweating, if your hands tremble.
He compares Sipilla to a father-in-law who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilla can make her point well, it can work.
The situation is different from when the government would inform you about something, because in this person it is like talking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and partners of President Barack of the United States regularly do.
Very Extraordinary
The policy investigator Erkka Railo considers the speech of the Prime Minister to citizens truly exceptional.
He said that this has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister will speak directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The investigator believes that this is how the Prime Minister wants the Finns to be sympathetic with the pressures ahead.
Employee organisations will organise a demonstration and strikes against government activities on Friday.
On Twitter, President of the Left Association, Paavo Arhinmäki says that Sipila could hold her speech on the state of the nation in the parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, and that the speech would also be discussed.
The president of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), reiterates its challenge to the Sipilian dialogue.
We don't have time for the monologues.
About six months from the election.
You can't hide the endless. Rinne writes on Twitter.
The boy on his nine-year-old escape has been found in Tampere.
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
The boy's father updated his Facebook pages.
The Police Department of Finland also confirms the issue for the evening press.
The boy went out for a play at 4:00 a.m.
Later this evening, there was no contact with him.
My father thanks all the people who helped us find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed more than 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violence of young people: You are in the process of hatred
Makwan Amirchani, a Kurdish free fighter, published a video on Facebook, which appeals to young immigrant backgrounds in particular.
Makwan Amirkhani had to speak against young street fights.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arrived with his family, who was five years old in Finland, has so far won both his professional game in the most renowned UFC series.
Amirchani says she received a message asking me to see a Instagram account.
Videos have been downloaded to the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the wildlife of young people.
A 26-year-old Amirchan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
You guys kick down, sit on the other side and strike blindly without thinking about any of the consequences of this when you do these videos, Amirchani's up-to-date.
It's hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people on videos are immigrant backgrounds.
According to Commissioner Jarmo Heinos of the Helsinki Police, social media has downloaded fight videos for both immigrants and domestic youths.
It's just that you guys are fighting all over the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, the Turkian Amirchani reminds us.
Amikhani reminds us that there are websites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite abundant.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be here for a long time.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here, says Amirchani.
Amirchhani tells young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the target of some racism, you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Just think about it a couple of times before you go with that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action gives rise to racism.
You're going to get the hatred that I don't like.
You're having a pretty bad time anyway, and that's not what you're going to do to make them better, Amirchani decides.
The SAK takes his position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, President-in-Office of the SAK, Lauri Lyly tells us that the employees' organisation will consider its position on Monday on the alternative savings list presented by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
The STTK previously informed the Government of its own proposal on Wednesday to achieve the 5% productivity rate required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre).
The open President, Sture Fjäder, believes that the government will accept the proposal if the SAK, the STTK and the Agenda are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest employees' organisation to soften its previous position.
Mr Lauri Lyly, president of the SAK, commented in a slight manner on Twitter.
Mr Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to open up the labour market and that there is a need for agreements made by active parties in place of forced laws.
Mr Lyly recalls that the proposal by the Government of Mr Sipilä for a social agreement was not valid for the SAK.
In the past, Sipilä cut the negotiations on the social agreement when the SAC refused to commit to the 5% productivity target.
Comment: A big show threatens to leak, "I think it's a bit funny to put on a fist"
I mean, it feels a bit funny to put a fist in your pocket, if there's already a reconciliation paper, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmospheres vary from the side of the wage camp.
Is it meant to call the government to annul, or is it to agree with it?
On Monday, the Feds of the SAK cried the sacred hatred of the Government of the Republic.
Whole Finland was threatened to close up.
It spread to the nobles, too.
The teachers' organization OAJ threatened to close schools and day-care homes.
Tuesday, the OAJ canceled: no school or daycare is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) Chairman of the STTK was reconciled.
He said that he had kept contact with the government and that he would draw up the alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) for a five-prozent productivity score.
Mr Sture Fjäder (kok) rushed to report immediately that his paper was already ready.
At first, there wasn't a yard in the GERMAN's office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the federal leaders just Monday ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAC would meet next Monday to deal with the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions for "opening the labour market".
In order to create a joint presentation by employees, the SAK should tend to accept a 5% productivity rate as a target.
No miracle is that Palolan STTK has relations with the Government of Sipilah.
The right hand of the fire, the director of the STTK’s social contribution, Jukka Ilonus, was formerly the special assistant of the Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhaske and Mari Kivinieme.
The Palola characterized that government ay-knowledge has been improved all the time.
Coincidence or no, but Palola's exit took a little bit off the Finnish stoppers, which, as a bowshot, evacuated by the ACP Marko Pierainen (sd).
I mean, it feels a bit funny to put on a fist if there's already a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18.00 p.m.: Added information on Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland as a bad host: "This must not happen again."
The President of the Russian duma Sergei Naryshkin criticised the Helsinki OSCE.
Sergei Naryshkin, the Russian Duuma President, believes that Mongolia is a better host of the OSCE than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, the OSCE has started a symposium, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki Hungary Conference.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, to arrive at the meeting - a matter that the President was reminiscent of journalists.
We believe that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of an open dialogue.
This can't happen again, Naryshkin emphasised the news office, according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was addressed to the United States, which was also prevented from entering.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshk's poster.
The Russian delegation of Mongolia was inconvenienced, so Naryshkin continued to speak with Finnish praise and praise of Mongolia for the 'experienced organisation'.
I am sure that the Parliamentary General Assembly will go constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Kook), who has already discussed the Russian delegation, according to the Russian media.
The lock meets a real playoff mirror: "The paintings in a tight place"
Tappara and Slukko are going on today in the Haka forest for bull days when both are on fire on the second day.
Janne Lahti predicted today that there was no real goal celebration in the Haqqani forest.
Tappara went to Kuopia last night to a 3-2-long-term victory on KalPa.
The rise was manly, because the silver team of the last season was at its worst about the loss position of two goals.
The lock was more mosle than Tuesday.
The Ramalians’ catch as the guest of Blues was round zero points, and the loss counts were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any are playing the same game as last year, the Clasp-Scraper Janne Lahti anticipates the settings of the company on the pages.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the crabs.
In fact, in the last two periods, Tapara has just dropped in the middle of the Luko final series.
Both times the solution has been called for a decisive seventh match.
In the last season, the Lock took the series off in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three sides and past.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups except for the target cars.
Both the cashiers rejected yesterday will be able to get a bell shift today.
With the goal of the Killer, Mika Noronen makes space for Tomi Bearhus, and between the lock-drops, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Vision angle: A nasty play going on in the Aesia
The sports director Toomala handwritten the inappropriate extension of the head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoine from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone handwritten Rocky film, where he played the main part.
The underman put a heavy series on the world champion Apollo Creed in a sensational way.
Rocky got great sympathy, even though he finally lost the title game.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Tolala handwritten the unrest moto in Pori.
The anonymous and wooden batteries went on to everyone's surprise for the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but stubborn underwriters like Rocky.
There was a white Indian, Pori Matt and Pelle Pelto.
In fall games, the players colored their heads red and cut off the irokes.
The wishball became a blonde.
The great TV reporter JP Jalo called Coach Neumann.
Asses took the won silver.
The hope was one of the heroes.
The manwriter, Tolala, believes that the new work of this season works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as the Aces' sports director has built a pawn in the hands of the devil boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have spilled guys in a box like Rocky's pig carnations in a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitsen, Juha Kilholma and Matti Kuparis' earnings are in some other place than in a giant game.
Mr. Hailah has forgotten that Rocky VI's main role is being played by Pekka Rautakalio.
Karri Stone has been baptized to Sean Connery of the Rautakallion.
Iron Tallio is just as clumsy as Connery would have been in the original edition of 1976 at Rocky.
There's nothing like Rocky in the iron casket but a nickname.
Iron Ball's game philosophies aren't part of crawling and peeling.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's different to play hard like a pig.
In the last season, Garrett Stafford of the Asses stabbed Tapara into the head of Jere Karyan.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Tallion put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I don't accept a game like that, and it's not part of the ashtray, Ironakalio, hot, worn up after the game to the people of the Satate.
The Aesian team of this season has been constructed strangely.
There are trains, veterans, cops, and cheerleaders.
In practice, there are no key men in the best game age.
No wonder the principal coach has complained about a lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence the player's acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season's events have an impact on procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather short, Rautakallio responded diplomaticly.
Underneath the surface.
The 1953 Rautakallio of the Year model is known to be interested in moving to Toula's place to a sports bomb.
The men's contracts will end in the spring.
The Aesian balance in the three galams of the season has as many losses as the target difference between 1 and 6.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband when she was a teenager in Tuuka, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time in the direction of her husband.
Yeah, I'm playing the mother of my husband's friend in the movie.
In a way, it seems crazy, an actor, and a producer of Olga Temonen laughs.
He's been married to a Abilanna's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has worked a lot together before, but for the first time, Olga plays in Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in telling us about the early years of Abilanna You made us a beautiful film is the drummal Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
The circling of the chimp and supports his son, even though his father Risto (that performs Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be a sound of reason.
The more I have learned my real picture of Sirkka, the easier it is to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuukka that he trusted me in the role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the twin has become much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, communicated.
The circus has been very helpful.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
I'm also lucky to understand that drama is drama and the truth may need to be slightly colored.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Aidan would become the biggest band in Finland.
In the '90s, it was lame and really dull.
There was a pretty small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga tells me that she had heard a lot from Tuukka before the film plans.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been slightly different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuuka, known as Heinola’s infamous sketch.
Olga was a palace and a nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
He could've had a secret love.
According to Olga, over the last 10 years, he has worked so hard with Tuuka that a large joint project is not scary.
It's always been super-good.
Now the whole production group goes to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in Italy is often planning to drive home for the sake of their little children for the night, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over all Heinola for a month.
They have taken us very warmly, just asked which streets and when to be empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play film in Finland
Iron Sky, controlled by Timo Bergensola: The Coming Race film has a budget of EUR 17 million.
The photographs will start in October in Belgium.
Timo Vuurensola, director, begins to picture the Iron Sky 2 film in October in Belgium.
The Scifie movie Iron Sky extension, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be the most expensive play film in Finland with its 17 million euros budget.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on Jumalari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation in action is rising after the completion of Iron Sky 2 as the film's budget is over EUR 100 million.
The films of Timo Vuurensola and Tero Remote will begin in October at the AED Studios premises near Antwerpen and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuurensola is going to Belgium next week.
The giant budget isn't scare.
I've been so sick!
I'm so relaxed about a cool script because I know exactly what a movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though the time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he'll tell the evening magazine.
Originally, 8 to 10 million were planned for the film's budget, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big storie, too.
However, a picture of 100 million should be pressed because each angle and every performance is so expensive.
Now everything's been so tight, that there's no discovery.
The film production company Iron Sky Universale launched this Wednesday a public finance campaign and a bond with a annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and offer during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will repay the loan.
Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov are played in the action film.
Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trends have recently been cleaned by big logos.
A while ago, a fashion-consequent dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs and Crocs.
Advertising the hood or t-shirt mark was seen as a junkie.
It's time that changes.
Sports has become a real Megatrend of fashion, and so have old, familiar sports models like Adidas and Nike risen to the cool wavebridge.
And, like so often before, the boundary of funny and trendy is ugly: if something is already right, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm Core trend, i.e. a tasmo, where the trendsetters surprised to recommend the most boring basic clothing as a means of separating from the mass.
Now, instead of a gray basic college, it's already buried on the bottom of the cabinet, in front of which the manufacturer's logo comes up.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas identified rails, the favorite team's gambling shirts and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to the street.
Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports markers to luxurious bands.
For example, the brass of Versace’s Snacks make it clear what a sign of clothing is about.
Would you be ready to introduce logos in your dressing?
The Russian police officer published the evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank lock for hours!
According to the allegations, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, which held Russia Arms Expo, representing Russian military products, 2015.
The Russian media has spread colorful claims in recent days that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove Zotov from large sizes for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to challenge the data.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook pages, in which he seems to be swinging around the door of a tanker vehicle in very good moods and, at least, on the basis of these pictures, it is about being stuck or angry.
That's bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into the battlepanzer, but it was a raid tank BMP-3.
I've been a former soldier, Colonel. I've served at Ural.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace, Zotov told Comosomolskay to Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I really didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
To the Russian army's TV channel Zotov explained his desire for the exhibition of Russia's new technology, as he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagon, and I was attracted to our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And I'm definitely going to take all the tanks and all the collision tanks to the next exhibition, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called a reporter who wrote it as an idiot.
One fool wrote, and everyone else said it again.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and rattled, but nothing like I'm stuck somewhere in a tank, it didn't happen, he said to the Russia sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photograph of the alleged imprisonment has been published, even though in a few days, a total of 50.000 people attended the arms exhibition.
The claim of Zotov’s imprisonment started on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotov was told that he was ripped out of the tank lock when he tried and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around, unless he escaped the surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a further story in which the organizers of the exhibition explained their view of what happened.
Everyone's just used to jumping quickly out of armed vehicles.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his large size, simply stayed when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours, said to Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot, coordinator of the exhibition.
Here's the favorite thing for the decorative bloggers.
The architectial brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Fleming (1902-84) The laser candle from 1962 appears to be designed today.
A six-headed steel snack is like a piece of art, and it was originally a piece of art.
Architectal brothers are known for long and mathematically accurate form of a barn.
At first, it was presented only to the renowned guests of the lords for dinner.
Kubus candles are manufactured by the family company By Lassen, who maintains the design tradition of famous brothers.
The candles are manufactured in eight, four and one candle versions in Holstebro, Denmark, in four different colors.
The cube can be obtained in black, white and nickel and copper stiff.
The candle is currently topical and fits in many kinds of homes.
It has been the most popular feature of the decorative bloggers in recent times.

You're trying someone's endurance.
He's not a piece of paper, but you know he's not like a stone.
You are the same on a number of things, like life force.
You're wondering how things go on.
You have strength and willful space to make them succeed.
Mildness to yourself and to others is also important.
You're smart, but you're not fast enough to make someone understand your position on this matter.
He's slow, and he doesn't want to be in charge with you, even with you.
You're going with someone on foot, because there's one thing going on.
There is no one way to approach it, but at least you know that you have a common goal.
You've taken a measure with someone.
But you are not competing in the traditional sense, but you want to know what he is really like for his men or women.
Your presumption will hit the right one.
That's why it's good to brace your chest.
You have a chance to be dealing with someone today.
Do it, even if your time is on the card.
There's a person of a particular nature.
You'll understand that at the latest when he opens his mouth.
Also, the parasites and expressions tell a lot a long time before that.
Someone's gonna be sad for you.
You do not notice that there would be anything amazing in this situation, but there is a lot of vague atmosphere in the air.
You know where you're going.
Your experience is right, even though someone wants to show you he is much more aware of things than you do.
The need for emphasis isn't the only thing that's sniffing in him.
Your preparedness for various tasks has grown over the years.
Someone sees potential in you.
It's going to work on your self-esteem.
You'll be wondering if there's anything wrong with it.
You're on the edge of the essence.
You know a lot where you move and who you want to spend your time with.
You don't stay in your place. You want to move forward.
You highlight a certain kind of thing about yourself so much that someone starts talking to you for that reason.
We're not going to end this conversation.
It shows how interesting you are.
There's been a leak in the Kittlä Mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The purified process water of the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called enrichment sand substrate into a stream.
According to the company, the measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool has neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water from the waxing process.
Usually the water is pumped for either reuse as process water or, according to the authorisation, through the surface lighting field to the environment.
The bleeding was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of leak water meets the current permit conditions.
There was no other substance in the environment.
The bleeding was observed during the inspection round on Monday morning.
No structural damage has been found to the dam structures of the pool.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred fixed workers.
Dansen Cuppomäki: IMF warns you not to cut too much
The country report published today by the International Monetary Fund, published by the IMF, follows broadly the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation paved to structural reforms covering Finland to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime allowances and paid holidays would contribute to Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contract system and for unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank's main economist Pasi Kuoppamämä, structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimate has a great deal of sympathetic messages for government activities, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Economic Sanome.
The IMF also feels that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support poor economic growth.
The IMF anticipates an economic growth of 0.4% for Finland for this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske anticipates today in its new forecast of economic growth this year.
The IMF is slightly more optimistic than this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was growing in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
The weaker confidence in industry or other so-called softer indicators could be reduced.
However, the differences are only a few per cent of the decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appointed a new leader
In July, under the responsibility of Saturu Iwata, who worked for cancer, Tatsumi Kimishima began working on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was popular and charismatic face in the game industry.
Iwata, for example, responded to the successful lanseration of Wii-console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima isn't a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assessing Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to be seen as taking Nintendo strongly into mobile games, but not to eat the company's bread on the traditional game consoles.
In Finland, more and more minor asylum seekers arrive alone
The Swedish Immigration Agency already recognised in February 2015 that hundreds of children who have come to the country will disappear annually.
The Swedish Immigration Agency says that hundreds of minors are lost annually on the website of SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter.
Juha Kannelmaa, the supervisor of the Immigration Service, tells us what the situation in Finland is and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear under the "land" year?- In 2013, a total of 156 minor asylum applications were made in Finland alone.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, similar applications were submitted 196 and 11 cannelmaa has disappeared.
As a result of the disappearance, it may be clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has been identified as a full age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue to deal with the matter in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some missing persons will also be found later when they are applying for asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were decommissioning decisions because the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the last 123 years, he says.
Is there an increase in the number?
By 6.9 this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications for minors alone.
There are no overall statistics on missing minor asylum seekers this year, but the number of minor applicants is known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he emphasises.
What about those who have decided to revert?
Will they, for example, be lost on the "black labour market"?
This is difficult to assess with regard to the Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the reciprocal decisions, and Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of Interior Petter Orpo (Kook) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered seekers.
He has taken action on this matter.
On Monday, the Orpo, who thought about refugee issues at the EU Minister of Interior, told us about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. studio online - see pictures of devices
Due to the seizures, Timo T.A. The equipment used for the TV and radio production of Mikkosen is now being sold.
Mikkosen’s spouse Nina Mikkonen sells the equipment at Huuto.net, which were once the most advanced professional tools in the field.
The first web page on the website was the Nightmacasin.
Today, a large part of the equipment has remained in the footsteps of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs are no longer filmed for Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still trusting that there are interested people.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that must be digitalised.
On the other hand, there's also a lot of hobbies, collectors and own studio builders, Nina Mikkonen thinks about IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move away from the present House of Myrskylä.
There's no way we can take all the goods with us.
I've slowly started to invent and see what stuff they're giving up.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no use for television and radio equipment anymore.
As a result of recent strokes in the brain, it is clear that a man who made a long career will not return to his work life again.
Nina Mikkonen says they're just selling goods and equipment now.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s actual life work was archived in the summer of the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other materials from Myrskyla.
Transport threatens to drill worse than it thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The metro and the drivers of the trams will decide today whether they will expand their forces with regard to Friday's demonstration of mind.
The original plan was to stop the transport of metro and trams only for the time of the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it's gonna work out if the traffic stops all day.
The main trust man, Pekka Hirvonen, says the threat is big on the ground.
The night and shift cuts are badly shaking the drivers, so the government's plans to cut the limbs are causing resistance.
However, it is a dilemma that the stopping of traffic for the whole day is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport is practically almost completely stopping in the capital area.
According to VR's data, trains do not travel between 6 a.m. and 6 a.m. on Friday.
On Friday, there's no local or long-distance traffic.
The trains left before 6:00 in the morning will be driven to the stations.
According to HSL's data, most of the buses remain in the shadow.
The ACP members are away from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, driven by headmen, and the HSL reporter Pirkko Repo bills.
Repo says that HSL is unable to say exactly what bus ranks are taking on Friday.
Employee organisations are organising a major announcement at the Helsinki Rautiatentor on Friday at 11-13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to the local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water jets against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas, and the teacher thought it was a self-conscious watch bomb.
In the United States, Ahmed Mohamed, 14 years old, has been arrested since the teacher held the original watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News he wanted to show her about the output of his electronics.
However, one of the teachers thought the bell looked like a bomb.
The police were invited to attend, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to the juvenile prison cell.
Mohamed has never been found to claim anything but that he had made a watch.
Still, it is still possible that the boy is accused of doing a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had said the clock looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in the police's storage, but it was known to be composed of a circuit board and a digital display with wires.
The incident happened last Monday, and Mohamed was punished for three days from school.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Islamic Council of the country wonders if the case is another evidence of islamophobia in the United States.
The director of the labour refused to sing a national song.
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism presented by the press which is delicate to the right has also been accompanied by representatives from Corbyn's own labour party.
This has hurt the people, thought the labour national representative Kate Green in the radio interview of the BBC.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday’s commemorative event respected the battle of British Air Force Flyers against German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corby in its official opinion and emphasises that he has shown his respect for pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood still with respect during the national song, emphasised in the statement.
Corbyn's choice of party leader has divided the labour lines.
In particular, there are those who fear him to deport moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby supports unilateral disarming, the closure of savings and the increase in public expenditure.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn will be present in Parliament as a party leader at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for proposals on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron was picking Corbyn as party leader over the weekend on Twitter.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister's twitter on his own account.
The reason for Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for a legal case.
South Lake Minnetonka police have soon been investigating the family death in Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
The five - souled family was found dead on September 10, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was Brian Scott Short, the father of the family, 45.
The first time Brian Short shot himself in the garage, his wife and three children were shot with a shotgun, he killed himself.
Dead days ago
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection visit and found a huge house all over Short’s family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million houses and a successful company
South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar's case is still under investigation.
The motive of the blood cells is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on AllNurses.com, a social media site for nurses.
In 2014, in the interview with StarTribune, Short reported that there were four million different visitors on the site every week.
I have been awarded 50 buy-in bids over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell a company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the fact that Short’s family bought a house in Greenwood in 2011 for two million dollars.
The house is advertised to a real estate site in Zillow as a car collector’s dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also eight cars are equipped with a garage.
The Court's case on the line
But according to StarTribune, the father of the family was waiting for a case of justice.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various prepaid courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no prepaid comments had been removed from Short's website and had therefore lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the proceedings would have had a very significant impact on Short’s transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffees
In addition, three of the owners were rewarded at the treatment event at the monthly Hippos Prize for the horse owner in Finland.
It's great, Loiri commented in a good mood on her glorious table.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist's legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the big competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the success horse coach Korpi will get full peace of work with the horse.
Pekka tells me where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'm gonna keep my mouth shut, Loiri laughing.
The great gesture of the NHL star, "The greatest donation ever made by a sportsman"
The Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated 10 million dollars (approximately EUR 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to the hospital press, this is a single donation made by the largest athlete of all times to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26 - year - old Subban is committed to assisting the hospital in other cases for the next seven years of its fundraising.
A year ago, Subban made an agreement with Canadiens worth eight years and 72 million dollars.
So the amount of subban donation is significantly higher than that of his nine million dollars in the year.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive a hall space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have already helped local hospitals considerably.
A year ago, the long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same child hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a giant amount of money for another city’s major hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
You can order a wife from a Japanese coffee shop tonight, serves food with a bikini and a squirrel on her.
The theme cafes are hard in Japan.
The market already has a cafeteria, a canine coffee, a vampire coffee shop, a cologne, and now a wife's cafe.
It hits lonely, folks and hungry people.
It's been news by Metro.
You can order for a wife or husband's evening at the Tokyo coffee shop Ore no Yome (My Finnish wife).
This is a waiter who pretends to be a client's spouse.
"Poliso" is selected from the list before you get to the cafeteria, and he makes and serves food.
The wife is only an eagle and a bikini on her head, and the husband is in tight bike shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length and weight of the candidates on which the math they prefer to sleep.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: the attacks on car security began to be equipped with:
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, the information document published by Intel.
The Board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out ongoing safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practice in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of the results of the ASRB study.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consultancy company, estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in the transport sector have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles can consume, generate and distribute online data.
We can and we must improve the cyber security of cars, says Chris Young, head of Intel Security.
With the help of the ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of each connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road, which makes ASRB the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about EUR 52 000 in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS model has been expected for years as a rising moon.
Finally, the car begins to be in the face of Finland.
Ford published RS data now that the car world's eyes are on the Frankfurt car exhibition.
Ford's new four-wheel RS accelerates, thanks to its 2.3-litre, 350-speed engine, in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and high speed it has 266 kilometres per hour.
There is also a price for Finnish interest, it is presumed to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already ordered, though when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell us when he is briefed.
The favorite sign Kia presented two new news at the Frankfurt car exhibition - these are new Sportage and Optimia
The new fourth generation of Sportage is certainly more important than the two new Finnishs, with which Kia intends to catch a larger wing from the ever-growing street sweep market.
The new design manager of Europe, Gregory Guillaume, created by Sportage, is more round than before.
There's been an inch in the axle and outdoors, and the car's breaking air more efficiently.
The range of engines is in its main character, but it has been added to 177 horsepower-enhancing turbos of 1.6 litres.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption is reported closer to sales.
We'll have to wait a little longer because we'll have a new Sportage coming in the spring of 2016.
The new Kia Optimás came to our country before the year went to change.
Suddenly, the news doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of the higher middle class buyers with improved driving features, lower noise level and higher level of equipment.
At first, Optimizes are obtained with 1,7 litres of turbodiesel and 2,0 litres of petrol engines.
Next summer, the pace will be accelerated when Optima GT, equipped with a turbo engine of 2.0 litres, arrives next to them.
At the same time as you come, you start selling Optimia farmer.
Chisu returned to the stages... sneaked in a bold wrist suit.
The singer Chisu is part of the Life Baby concert with other domestic stars.
There's a beautiful, open neck hole in the blue pants.
The suit is beautifully presenting the belt of a creek of a singer.
The whole is crowned by a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During the three years of break, a singer who became a mother has been able to get pregnant with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year.
The singer published his first single from his new album in August.
Back to the stages and to the public after a long break, I'm not really excited.
I've missed everything to do with music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will publish in a couple of weeks her new album, and at the same time her fourth album, Polaris.
A new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, I'm wondering if people find my new album, Chisu's wondering.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is again annoying... now you see the front.
The real-tv beauty Kim Kardashian gives the topics one after each other.
She presents her pregnancy bag and breast-lifting with noisy sexy clothes last night at 1 am in America when she and her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, left Kanye West's job.
Black maternity dress is transparent in front of the breasts.
It reveals the skin colored bras under the lightning dress.
The last time Kardashian was dressed as an amateur motherhood when she visited her friend for dinner in New York only a few days ago.
They emphasised black overpants.
The third special maternity costume is as fresh as from Friday last week, when a pregnancy bag was in the showtime.
The hard laws of the world of models: No home, you are lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne.
He made his own documentary of Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues speak their mouth clean of model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered Leloup's six hard truths behind the cults.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even in the previous period, even if you had been chewing in the homes of top designers, the new season begins with castings again.
And every season comes new, fresh faces that compete from work with the coconuts.
Malls rarely have a place to call home.
The work is a continuous travel and can take a year so as to have a hotel room or a apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother can not travel with you, loneliness can be inadmissible.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of weight.
Agent New York might ask you to drop a kilo, but in Paris, they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion, the models and designers are together all the time, while they are a support network.
When the fashion sauces end, the difference is vague.
The models want this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but the fact that everyone thinks it's just a presentation of clothes.
Even models want to be their own personality.
Work makes the models feel that they're actors with some kind of role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
The models last night at Tory Burch's show.
In New York, fashion weeks are being spent, where designers reveal their models next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Avalanta musician in the movie
Roope Salminen presents an AAA in a film based on the early years, Antti Lautala, the founder of the band.
In 1991, Latala set up Abilanna with Toni Wirtase, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me because I'm a rap-artist who's about 26 years old, and in this movie I play a 16-year-old guitarist, Salmine laughs.
I didn't want to meet the real Ant before the shoots, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to the people, so I think it's good that I only learn his playstyle from the video.
I don't want to make an imitation of a person.
The man who's been riding the Roope Salmine and the Dog Association isn't going to do the role.
The Punk Maniers are coming according to the man's nature.
In the punk season of the Stars and Stars, I'm sure a lot of people saw the prestige, as well as if they've ever been to our works.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go full.
The main performers of the "Basso" film were published today by Tuukka Temose, who played the bass in 1993-2004.
Young actresses who are still quite unknown to the audience are presenting a nuclear force familiar to the band’s audience.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki plays Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo basist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip about her future washing last night when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he would prepare for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published yesterday in Instagram a picture of his new log that he has had to perform for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the whiskey and the jaw, has driven his face to be silopous, and colored his brown hair black.
Psychologist Advice: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
We don't need to talk about this, a member of the SPR crisis team, counseled by psychologist Ferdinand Garoff.
It is worth protecting younger children, for example, not allowing them to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and they can stay spinning in mind and harassing, he says.
However, if a child has encountered television news pictures of refugees or heard it elsewhere, it is worth speaking.
It is good to have a discussion on the starting points of the child and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of the child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones that the parent thinks he is afraid of.
A child should not be frightened for nothing, even if he's intimidated and frightened.
A younger child closely monitors the behaviour of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe.
Larger children will probably encounter a debate on refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to speak with them if it is a matter of reflection on the child.
The fact is, not all people in the world are well.
Parents and children can wonder how our family feels about this.
However, do we think that the world is at last a safe place or a safe place?
The parents may also have different educational perspectives, some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family talks about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the challenges that come ahead in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social Psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Lear your child to help a weaker"
Your own powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child
It's hard to control the fireland that hits the blood.
Pertus Pohjola was able to squeeze Apila's fireplace to stare at the attack in the middle of the summer.
It was only winnings and second-hands until, at the end of July, in Tampere, there was a collapse.
Since the slave was completely naughty, the coach suspected that something was wrong and ordered for time from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the discharge was found in the spectator.
The horse had an infection of the throat.
The disease wasn't from the mildest head, but it needed two medications to control it.
As the Pallosalama of Apula was forced to exercise lightly, Pohjola says that she is positively surprised by the last run of the horse.
It was in Turku at its record time after the wind of the SE-dog.
The Pallosalama of Appilan was under extreme pressure when it had been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
With these things in mind, a small tendency at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a fair competition has made a lot of work for the slaves.
I'm sure the horse’s vein went ahead, and I hope it would have been even.
Apilana's fireballama has been the so-called humor horses.

This is why you can't get rid of your iPhone software.
Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of Apple's iPhone phones can sometimes be removed in the future, but not all of them.
Apple may intend to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, reports the company’s CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed interview.
Apple's iPhone contains a number of programs that are relatively rarely used: FaceTime phones, Lehtkioski, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Vinks.
The most recent addition to these programmes is Apple Watch, who became a forced update to the iPhone phones, although it is necessary only for Apple's smart watch owners.
According to Cook, the removal of Apple's programmes is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications have been linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple's iPhone applications work closely together with other programmes.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter because the company does not want to waste memory space from the iPhone phones of users.
Inflation in the euro area decreased to 0.1 per cent in August
In August, consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly, i.e. 0.1 per cent from year-on-year, and Eurostat reported today by the EU statistical authority.
The rise in prices was caused by energy lowering downwards.
In this way, Eurostat reviewed the 0.2% estimates from a couple of weeks ago.
In July, inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2 per cent cheaper than one year ago in the euro area last month.
The average inflation in the whole of the 28 EU countries was zero in August.
In July, there was an increase of 0.1 per cent.
Most of the euro countries, i.e. 1.4 per cent of consumers' prices, rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest at a decrease in prices by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the harmonised EU price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains firmly far away from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a significant increase in prices of two per cent in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
Next year, the rise will increase to 1.1%, and the central bank will anticipate its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
US Fed's next trying to blackmail monetary policy
The next recession in the United States begins at a faster rate than one year, but more certainly within three years after the central bank of the country Fed starts to raise its interest rates for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the fall starts before the next recession.
Fed has insisted that it may already start the interest rates this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
Therefore, the next recession can be pushed on at the fastest by the next fall and as a financial market course before that.
Or at least this will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets work as they have been in the way they have been and if they react to the extortion of Fed's financial assets as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been concluded by the German Bank Deutsche Bank’s strategics Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a study report on Long-Term Asset Return Study, which was over 60 pages, to its international major customers last week.
The strategy drawn up by the research and report does not believe that they will know exactly when Fed will start to raise its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market after that.
Instead, they present with the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, how the economy and the market have previously behaved during and after Fed’s interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they will examine the key parameters of the economy and financial markets now in the same or other model as at the time of previous interest rates - and what may be followed.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more delicate condition to sustain the rise in interest rates than once before in the 1950s.
Maybe not a year ago.
Throughout the last summer and early autumn, Fed's monetary policy and the leaders that decide on it, they have pointed out that the time will begin to be ripe to raise interest rates.
The first interest rate for over nine years can start this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised his so-called Fed Funds control rate in June 2006.
At that time, a series of fairly regular but at a time small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points ended equally for two years, where Fed increased its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The symptom of the financial markets began in 2007 with the most risk-weighted housing funding in the United States, and one year later the financial crisis broke into a global judging nightmare.
There was a major regression in 2009.
Last time, serious countervailings in the financial markets and the real economy began more slowly than since previous Fed’s interest rates have typically happened.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harder than once in the 1930s.
Deutsche strategies have seen the risings and bills of the largest economies in the world, as well as the conversions of the financial markets since 1950 and, from the beginning of the 18th century.
From the 1950s, Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impacts will be cleared.
The most rapid time since the first interest rate has taken place is less than one year, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The upturn in the financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed's interest rates.
Fed has repeatedly raised and adjusted its steering rate since the beginning of the 1950s to a dozen different cycles.
In some respects, each time is different from another, and the number of times is relatively scarce in the review, so it is hardly possible to conclude any of the effects of subsequent interest rates.
The strategy also reminds us that a number of things are different this time.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis may not necessarily be unquestionably identified by research for decades.
But for the reasons that led to the crisis and which have increased its destructive power, there must be some doubt:
1) Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other world's largest central banks held their governance rates too low in the 21st century.
They hired the prints of the technopup and raised the next.
2) Over the decades there was an accumulation in the financial and real economy, and still too much debt has increased as a result of the monetary policy of the central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in the economic history of the past was born.
3) In particular, the insane debt financing, which was the most liquid financial holdings, increased to most financial market sectors, the largest exchanges in economic history from shares in real estate, bonds and commodities.
Moreover, it is hard to argue that the high-risk financial markets were rarely dangerous and unstable when Fed and other central banks last drove up interest rates.
As a result, the financial structures underpinned by the debt instruments could not last as long as their period of time after the acquisitions had started and the cost of the debt financing had turned to rise.
The risks occurred as a financial crisis and resulted in a major recession.
Greater bubble and more debt
Deutsche strategies do not think what will happen next, but they give the subject of nuclearism by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now held their monetary policy even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even further lower.
( 2) For a long time, debt has not been insane as ten years ago, but now, at least, debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debts of the financial and real economy have not been reduced, but now, in different parts of the economy, the debt is a harder burden of debt than before or in the past before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity embedded by the former central banks as a leasing and cheaper place has remained largely on the financial market and has slowed down the key types of securities and assets at its highest value, or never before the financial crisis.
And the strategic atmosphere is not only in the light of the warning signals of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not recovered from the financial crisis and, for decades, from the hardest regression to the model that has taken place before.
The economy in the euro area has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually poor state, but similarly the pressures and risks of the financial markets are significantly higher than before the financial crisis when Fed next starts to tighten up its financial efforts.
Perhaps the picture of the future of the French bank Societe Generale Strategic Albert Edwards is not as strange as suddenly possible.
He has been training the international investor customers of the bank for the following complete translations:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon Fed's gonna be in a hurry to shut down the financial bills with even bigger QE money injections.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at the service side of HP, the company reports.
In November, HP will be divided into the HP Inc. of Hewlett Packard Enterprises and the Pc Machines and Printers for Consumers.
The number of staff of HP was the highest in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records the unit costs of EUR 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 2 500-30000 employees.
Consumer side reductions will remain to 3300 within three years.
The HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10 % of its operating profits.
In another year, its three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of their operating profits.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked in the government of the tax haven company
According to Ylen, the Minister for Transport and Communications Anne Berner (Central) has been a member of the government of the tax haven company.
According to Ylen, the company's activities were linked to the so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxembourg company Saltri II LuxCo, whose board Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says that he has left a notice of resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've left a divorce notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains will take place within the agreed timetable, says Berner in the Ylen interview.
Membership after merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Köhrs is a parket manufacturer who merged with the Finnish parket manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner was involved in the government of Karelia-Upoflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Köhrs and the Luxembourg company.
According to the above, Kährs' ownership is travelling in Luxembourg through the ownership structure of the multi-portal.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted a member of the Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Köhrs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the government of Karelia-Upoflor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company received a partner found in Sweden.
This company owned a venture capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to ensure that the capital interests of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the profits of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs already had a capital fund for the ownership of Triton, a Luxembourg holding company.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
In Espoo, Otaniemi, the first reception centre maintained by the company is opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 residents today from six o'clock.
The number of places can increase to a maximum of 300 to 400 persons within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will set up a reception centre in the property of the former rescue school.
The activities are maintained by Luona Oy, which is in particular the sector of the provision of health care and medical care services.
The city of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Agency and Luona Oy agreed together, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
The STTK prepares an alternative package for job extortion
The STTK will prepare an alternative package for the government's work life blackmails.
The organisation also hopes for other employees' centres.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention at the moment is on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing labour prices will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola pointed out the organization’s administration meeting for journalists at a break.
The Palola estimates that the Central Business Association (EK) does not, however, have the capacity to discuss.
The economists of the STTK have calculated that the security of the government's competitiveness package is estimated to cost the employer EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a terrible enthusiasm for the party to have a conversation if there's one relationship to 100 on the other side.
Palola: The negotiation link was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has wanted alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to provide a communication on its own package to the Parliament and start preparing the reforms.
Palola did not take the view of whether the schedule is realistic.
According to Palola, the contact with the government exists, and it has been constructive for him all the time.
In particular, the surgery of Sunday tickets to the STTK field is, according to Palola, a sick place.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation to implement a part of the blackmails.
In the STTK, according to Palola, it is not warmed up to prepare the alternative package with the SDP present.
Employees will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the work life extortion package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, for example, the salary for the first days of illness is cut, the overtime allowances are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited employees to a mental expression, and the aim has not been to organise a strike.
The Avata Fjäder congratulates
The open President, Sture Fjäder, congratulates the STTK's notification of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STTK is now on the same lines with Avata, since Akaka has already developed an alternative model for government presentations in the longer term.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be involved in the alternative package, because without the SAK, the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
The open President, Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, chaired by Lauri Lyly, will prepare the presentation as an option for surgery.
Antti Palolan STTK said that she would prepare new proposals on Wednesday.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the Agenda announced that it has long been preparing its own presentation to negotiate a 5% competitive leap of the country's government as an alternative to the cuts.
The scheme has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have been writing an alternative model for government presentations for a long time.
We are ready to see the terms of the service relationship as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to the Avata lines, as the STTK has previously done on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. on a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the same coal, the salads" plays bingo when you talk to Sipila tonight
Green Left of the University of Tampere
For the evening of the Viva Bingo Coupon of the Green Left of the University of Tampere.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exception speeches during the uprising and wars of Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy in Ylen's channels on Wednesday night at 21.05.
When applying for the previous speech by the Prime Minister, we have to go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he held a famous radio speech, which meant the beginning of the end of the rebellion in Mäntsälä.
After that, the President and ministers held a number of radio speeches during winter and prolongation.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho had a new year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In autumn 1976 President Urho Kekkonen stopped the strike of train managers by television.
Alone phone call, monarchist goin'.
The speech of the Sipilah has raised all day criticism and guessing what to come.
On Twitter, the president of the Left Association, Mr Arhinmäki, said that "Sipila could keep her speech about the state of the nation in the parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, and that the speech would also be discussed."
According to the Green Ville Ninisto, we've already seen a single phone call.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the SDP Erkki Judges condemned "monarchist makeup: the Prime Minister will tell the people what's best for it".
Antti Rinne, president of the SDP, challenged the Sipilá dialogue: "After six months of elections.
No single presence from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government’s Office, Sipilä’s speech is recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was commented on a direct transmission by the President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, and the Managing Director of the EK, Jüry Hähkä Man.
I've been criticised for the presentation of Sipilha's speech.
We considered this and said that it was part of the public service task to promote the comprehensive publicity of Finland as a whole, a line in the Ismo Silvo Ylen news of Yle's publications.
It's like me at the time of the Tammels.
The speech has also raised grimms.
After dinner, the children are combed and dressed for their best.
My mom wears the most beautiful hat on her, and my dad settles the tie around her neck.
At 9:00 a.m., they're shutting down on TV like I used to old time at the time of the Tammelas," writes the blogger Saku Timone.
"Is Prime Minister Sipilä also saying in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding their heads, who are preparing the law of pardon for other tax makers' friends, and at the same time claiming to the people that it is forced to cut when the state has the rest of the money?" Pia Lohikoski asks.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is the green left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has been published on Facebook by the bingo.
Do we hear about the same boat, the common coal, the living for debts and the team angel tonight?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05, it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: the Western countries rejected the proposal of Russia for the exclusion of Al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to give up the power of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, says President Martti Ahtisaari to Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian UN Ambassador has proposed a plan for Al-Assad to disappear in a stylish manner after a time.
However, the Western countries did not take the proposal because they thought Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin presented to him three points in a bilateral debate: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to get a speech contact immediately and the abandonment of al-Assad's power had to be under control.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree with all of this, but we will be able to discuss it openly.
I told him what I did there, and he said, "Sitting down in Alaska, Martti, and I'll tell you what to do, Ahtisaari remembers in the Guardian interview.
Diplomates do not comment
Ahtisaari tells us that she communicated the message of Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate to the press, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari’s claims, but said that Al-Assad’s troops had already committed a number of massacres at that time, and the main opposition groups refused all agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Middle East, is apprehending the speeches of Ahtisaari because, according to his experience, Russia was at no time ready to discuss the fate of Al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest part of Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about the speeches of Tshurkin, I would have answered that I would like to hear the same thing from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have been suspicious, even in that case, that it would have been Putin's match to hold power on some of Al-Assad's supporters.
Refugee current for our own actions
During the negotiations on Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the current year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own actions.
I don't see any other choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we're paying for the bill that we made, Ahtisaari says to the press.
Organisational centre of asylum seekers in Tornio
The organising centre for asylum seekers planned by the Government in northern Finland is likely to be set up in the Tower.
The centre would be set up in the building of the vacancies of Tornio in the centre of the city.
The Ministry of Interior has searched for a suitable place to better control the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, Helsinki Sanomat announced that the delegation would have already decided to present a school building as a spatial solution to the Ministry.
According to the Vice-President of the City Council of Tornio, it is not true.
When the entire delegation was not gathered and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting to decide on next Monday, he will specify to the STT.
At the local meeting, 36 of the 43 authorised persons were appointed.
13 officers were opposed to the Centre.
On this basis, it could be expected that the decision would be positive, says Höppinen.
According to Timo Nousiaien, the city received a communication on Monday, and a rapid response was made.
There would be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred feet from the border, so it would be working in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipila is still looking for an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centric), halfing of public holidays would only take part of the government's efforts to reduce the cost of work.
However, the Government would be happy to adopt an alternative package if the social partners succeed in reaching such an agreement.
Sipilä told the reporters that she had no contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for compensatory means for the blackmails of the government.
If such an agreement is concluded, we will certainly accept it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, the half of the holiday money would be a way of working, as it would be targeted by almost all employees, in contrast to the operation of Sunday bills, for example, planned by the government.
The labour market organisations could agree on the operation of holiday allowances because they are registered in collective agreements rather than in law.
In this vision, the government will tell the Parliament next Wednesday about the pressures of working life in the form of a Communication from the Government.
According to the Sipilah, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This isn't the final back limit, either.
The legislative work will then begin, i.e. the train is on the move and it will become more difficult all the time.
It's a good time.
It won't take long for these things, if you have a will, Sipila made it.
The list published by the government last week contains, among other things, the transformation of the end-of-life and helatorista into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the salary for the first days of illness is cut, the overtime allowances are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms will be implemented as a compulsive legislative act along trade unions, which has brought great criticism.
Employee Census organisations are organising a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Mayan Lake delegation approved the extension of the sap hall warehouse
The Council of May Lakes unanimously accepted the extension of the Nordic Koivu Hall, which is the juice hall.
The assessment was caused by the fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than originally spoken.
It's also a very busy schedule.
It was also a little wondered that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock at 400 to 450 square metres was approved in the investment programme, but the funding will be decided as a result of the sub-annual report.
It was still on the agenda about an investment of EUR 150 000-200 000, but Mr Erkki Iconen, technical director, said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis of the fact that it brings jobs and tax revenues to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väätö (ps.) explained.
Karelia’s Language Place in Joensuu
The city government reduced its former sturdy position to bring the street names of cattle to the center of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of maintaining the pasture of a cattle throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the cattle’s language because there are no historical grounds for it and the language of the cattle is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the riverside has been more part of the eastern savolic fractures.
After a new decision, there will be no cattle - language street signs in the city centre.
However, the city of Joensuu is also prepared, on a case-by-case basis, to use cattle language, for example in information tables and tourism marketing.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a one-linguistic municipality, it is also worth being open to the use of cattle language now that multiculturalism is living and changing strongly in North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still the special features of the county, as well as the image of Joensuu as the entire forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be well exploited in the multidisciplinary marketing of the county.
Traffic dismantling cuts the county's vitality
The operation of train connections strikes the vitality of the county with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the province's business and competitiveness.
And that affects whether we can live and work here, Kari Karjalinen, Mayor of Joensuu, is wondering.
He also highlights air transport, which has been followed several times in the report.
It is important for the whole of the country that we do not have the chances of reducing government measures, as is now going on.
We should look at the effects of these dismantling connections on employment, for example, Karelia emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections causes an additional challenge for the University of East Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here are, like traffic connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get to students and employees, Jukka Mönkkönen says.
He points out that bad traffic links also affect a research community that is very mobile and travels much because of the research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Head of Recognition, says that it is already difficult to market a university to western Finland, as traffic connections are weak in the longitudinal direction.
At the moment, about half of the students from the University of Eastern Finland are from outside Eastern Finland.
At the same time, about 10-20 per cent of them are from the New Land, which is partly explained by direct connection.
Joensuu became one of my voices for the war of Siu.
The view of the municipal government of Joensuu on the regional Siu warte project is evidently unanimous, but one of my disgusting voices is among them.
Pentti Central Salo, a member of the city government (sd., in the picture) presented the Government's meeting on Monday to give up the entire project, but his performance was unreliable.
The Government accepted the decision-making proposal by Mayor Kari Karjas, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will deliver a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year
Traffic services from Eagle to Kouvola will remain in the future, although less than one train shift.
Changes in passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola will take place next March.
One pair of trains leaves behind, but still five times a day goes from the Eagle to Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to government savings.
The purchase money for the next four years of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be stopped completely.
The VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped off.
The rescue facility lets a 12 - year - old man climbing the roof, who never got off the roof with his own help.
The situation was born at the Tornio Mountain at Ketotie at 6:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old double - layer wooden house with no ladder to the roof at all.
It did not prevent a bunch of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got the same way down, but one didn't.
As a result, others swept away from the place, and the transitors alerted the rescue facility to help the last man on the roof safely back on the surface of the earth.
FedEx's turnover fluctuations, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx published its last quarter's weak outcome. The transport sector was weakened throughout the year due to the decline in demand for freight services and the increased cost of land transport.
The company intends to hire 55 000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At this time last year FedEx announced that he would hire 50 000 seasonal workers during his vacation.
The company's share fell by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of the actual trade on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is $10.40 to $10.90 for the financial year which ends in May.
According to FactSet's study, analysts predicted $10.84.
In spite of the average price increases of 4.9%, the forecast has declined on 4 January.
The company is still looking forward to growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher turnover and growth in online trade.
The President and Managing Director, Fred Smith, stated that the company has been performing a very weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of production and global trade.
A day after UPS announced its plans to hire most seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90 000 and 95 000 people.
In the quarter of 31 August, FedEx’s operating profit was EUR 692 million, which means an increase of 6%.
The result per share was $2.42, so the 12 analysts of Zacks Investment Research were left on the forecast of $2.44.
Turnover rose by five per cent to $11.3 billion.
According to the six analysers interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been subject to a reduction in international second-class broadcasts, which has resulted in a deterioration of the activity of the Express Unit.
The strong growth of online trade has strengthened FedEx Ground's output.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operating profit was seen at increased cost of large-scale broadcasting and insurance.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, whereas the return on freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual opening of trade, FedEx's stock exchange rate had dropped to $ 3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the share reached 11 per cent of the annual average and 17 per cent of the highest note recorded on 11 June.
This week, Fed’s finalists of the United States Central Bank will meet at the most expected meeting for years. A group will sit at a diameter of eight-metres to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time to almost a decade.
On the wall of the decorated two-fold meeting room of the Central Bank, a wall painting from the United States is handsome.
It is a reminder that the central bank's President, Janet L. Yellen's colleagues, must put the state's financial interests ahead of all others.
The central bank has a double order from the Congress: maximise employment in the United States and keep prices here stable.
However, since the great lamb, the Governing Council has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This mandate may be missing a piece for the decision of the fiber. On Thursday, the Central Bank will be ordered to report whether the US economy is ready to start the unpredictable stimulus that has been offered by the short interest rates that remained close to the end of 2008.
Although most of the data indicates a steady growth in the economy, the recent decay in financial markets can already be prepared by cautious central bank officials to scare the increase in volatility by increasing the federal tax reference rate – even by a quarter of a percentage.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical monitoring", says the main economist Lindsey M. Piegza of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if a central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty on the global market is to give enough reason to wait yet," Piegza continues.
The questioners do not agree with what the Central Bank intends to do, which is already causing nervousness.
Approximately half of the economists in Bloomberg's study obsessed the increase in interest rates this week.
In financial markets, however, it is considered that the central bank is expected, and according to the most important indicator, there is only 30% chance of lifting.
If the central bank raises its steering rate, the stock exchanges may fall unless the decision-makers soften the impact by promising another lift.
On Tuesday, the Industrial Average Index of Dow Jones dropped 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
"The reason for the closure was the expectations of the central bank to maintain the control rate this week," said Moody's Capital Markets Research Group's main economist John Lonski.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank would raise interest at this stage," he said.
"If this happened, the central bank should consider carefully how to keep the hands of the financial market shattered."
The second experts, on the other hand, noted that by increasing interest rates, it would be possible to calm down the financial markets and to eliminate uncertainty as to when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, the central bank seemed to have tied to increase interest rates by 0,25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step in reinforcing financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has pointed out, along the spring and early summer, that she had expected to raise interest rates this year, despite the fact that the liberals believe that economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is now at the lowest in seven years and close to the level that the central bank is counting as full employment.
Looks like wage incomes are upsetting.
Although inflation continued to fall below the ECB’s annual 2% targets, the central bank’s decision-makers stated that the key reason for this is the temporary impact of oil prices.
"The economy can take up higher interest rates and it will need them, as long as they take into account the firm situation on the labour market," said the main economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, Ian Shepherdson.
However , the financial markets throughout the world did not burst last month when China deregulated its currency.
Dow Jones industrial average dropped up to 16 percentage points from the May record height, and investors feared that the recession of the Chinese economy would also affect global growth.
The market has evolved this month, and Dow Jones has now decreased by almost 10% in May's top reading.
The deterioration of the market means that the decision-makers of the central bank will be further complicated in considering the increase in the management interest rate.
"The Central Bank's work will be complicated despite what happened on the financial markets and the news of the weakening of the Chinese economy in the past weeks", UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate's senior researcher and former central bank official Stephen D. Oliner said.
Now he believes that the central bank will wait at least one month to address the effects.
"There is great uncertainty about what will have an impact on the US economy, and there is little reliable information about the situation after the recent developments in the Chinese economy," Oliner said.
The rehabilitation of the world economy is not the main concern of the Central Bank, so it should in principle not affect the decision-making of the Central Bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most powerful part of the world's monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, just a suggestion from President Ben S. Bernanken that a central bank could deteriorate the scope of its activities has resulted in confusions around the world.
In today’s world, markets and economies are closely interconnected, and the central bank is also required to contact other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the world economy.
"The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more artistic than science," said Zachary Karabell, the financial management company Envesnet Inc, who is responsible for the global strategy.
This month, President Lacker of the Regional Central Bank of Richmond, said that the Central Bank had previously overreacted to movements of financial markets that seemed to have no connection to the basic economic pillars.
Mr Lacker, a member entitled to vote in the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for an increase in the management rate, as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The Asian economic crisis led to a decision by the Central Bank at three meetings to calculate the steering rate by 0.75 percentage points, although only limitedly identifiable sanctions were available for US economic growth," said Lacker.
A year later, the central bank repealed the decision.
"The Central Bank should put monetary stability to the first place in a major crisis, such as the 2008 economy collapse," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest committee.
The last burst doesn't even draw close to the situation," he said.
"There is no reason to fear the lifting of the shells because of the shock of the market," Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen added.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and it does not mention financial stability, and until that change comes, I do not have to go ahead."

Brazilian Children’s Association of Rio Grande Children’s Doctors to promote a proper diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Children’s Association of Rio Grande Children’s Medical Association SPRS has developed a blinding way to teach lactating women the meaning of a proper diet. They are given pictures of babies breast-feeding with pictures of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, so the baby gets all the food it needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to additional energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by approximately 500 kilos.
In addition to increasing calories, a new study suggests that there should be other changes in diet.
A recent study of professor Robert Waterland, Texas Baylor College of Medicine, revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women can affect baby genes and protect the baby from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet has been shown to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
Seven Sunrise's most viewers, even though Nine's trying to get the lead in her Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would thank Canberra for making a morning program on the post-marks of the Liberal Party's leadership elections, which, however, did not greatly improve the figures of Today's viewers.
The Nine Channel's morning program was sent from the capital of Malcolm Turnbull after Tony Abbott's exit.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage's competitive channel morning program was sent from London. Special broadcasts for the week are also sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
On the distance, it seems that it was not important for Australian television viewers, as Sunrise saw on average 397 000 audiences in five capitals of the state, and today’s programme was 339 000 viewers.
Today’s viewers rose slightly to last Monday (317 000) compared to Tuesday (283 000), but last Thursday there was a reading (343 000).
Today's been hanging up the distance to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today averaged 318 000 audiences, Sunrise 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40 000 and 50 000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has so far reached an average of 349 000 viewers and Today 314 000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
Changes in the winds will affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking.

Seven had a remarkable news series of 800 Words with the former Packed to the Rafters Star Erik Thomson.
The New Year’s Drama tells about a recent widow's father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children. A new series reached 1 219,000 viewers.
The critics have doubted whether Thomson would be the star of the hit series alone, without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to last night's viewers figures, the answer is clearly positive.
Sevenin The X Factor maintained its strong position on 1 136,000 viewers. The Block (838,000) and the TBL Familys series (726,000) were gloriously defeated.
Seven's The Chase Australia has seized the viewers in various ways.
Andrew O'Keefe’s first half hour (17.00-17.30) of the new series of twists followed on average 446 000 audiences.
In the second half hour (17.30-18.00), the audience rose to 623.000, which was more than Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613.000).
On Monday night, in the first half of The Chase Australia, there were an average of 520 000 audiences, and the second half gathered outstanding 720 000 viewers.
Hot Seat's viewer number was 620 000.
The Chase Australian second night's viewers show Nine channel that Hot Seat's going by until 17.30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minutes, who couldn't challenge the McGuire series.
The case was originally published in the title "Sunrise One, Today focuses on local news"
The final triangle thinks that Sam Wood really is a single mate of dreams — but who does the man choose?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have unintendedly revealed the choice of Dreams' bachelor.
Sam Wood's final choice of dream bachelor has been a carefully preserved secret.
The three remaining women don't say a word about who has received the last rose from the male.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before one of the threees was dropped.
Sam Wood's lips are strictly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women glorified that Wood was a perfect man. Women commended the man's sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness, and viewed him as a suitable partner.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood, if the last rose did not hit themselves, their answers could give an indication of who would take the bachelor’s heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay themselves as the most suitable partner for Wood.
It's been easy between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood from the beginning.
"When I got into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam were very fit together, and this feeling has remained throughout the program," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah has legs on the ground, and he's really fun company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay told me he realized on a hometown date last week that Wood could be the real one.
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this wasn't just a race, and now I'm putting on our relationship full," said Mackay.
When Mackay was asked who Wood would have to choose if a man didn't choose her, she answered mysteriously:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls as much, Snezana and Lana are equal."
Dreams' bachelor on Ten Canal Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
The case was originally published in the title "Sarah Sam Wood's choice"?
Jarryd Hayne has several options for the NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne since this transformed into the United States. A number of other associations were interested in the man after the impressive open day of practice last year.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like it hit the button.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, like a man in the line of the Australian rugby team. Hayne drew up the flight run on Tuesday 20-3 from Minnesota.
Tomsula, however, showed confidence in Hayne and gave the man a new chance to return the strike. Coach kept the Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula continued to line in the suit after the game.
He wasn't robbing in front of the other team. He encouraged them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
Special editor Cam Inman of 49ers reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the unsuccessful capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne telegrams on the jackpot, in the first quarter of the game against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and her Australian fans had been waiting for anything else from a man's NFL debyyt.
After the failure, Hayne left the field at a hundred and later told Hamish and Andy on the 2 DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"These things hurt, and we have to move forward," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the error with his debut in the State of Origin in 2007, when his input in his own area opened a place for Queensland.
However, the full experience was incredible for a 27-year-old young man.
Hayne published a picture in Instagram, where she poses with fans and Australian flags.
Elton John and President of Russia Vladimir Putin discussing gay rights
In 2003, Mihail Hodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested with a gun at the airport in Siberia.
Hodorkovski, who was openly challenged by President Vladimir Putin, was sentenced, the oil company owned by the man, Jukos was eliminated, and his work in favour of democracy was limited.
Four dead cops fired with rubber bullets in Nepal.
Four people died in South Nepal, a source of authority told us on Wednesday, and the police shot a bunch of people in anti-constitutional protests against the country's alleged new constitution. Among the victims was a four-year-old boy.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region, less than three hundred miles from the capital of Katmandus.
According to the district chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 demonstrators had been gathered outside the police station, some of which threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and fired the air before the rubber bullets were fired.
He said 20 cops and five civilians were wounded.
It is not quite clear why rubber odours, which may, but which are generally considered to be a less destructive option, were suddenly so fatal.
It was a recent reconciliation in recent weeks of protests in the southern regions of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, the new constitutional counties would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in West Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands its own country.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent depravities since 10 August,
Four major political parties signed the agreement on the distribution of the country into the counties, a major step towards the new Constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where administration has been centralised for centuries.
The new Constitution has been working since 2008, but the legislation accelerated the process after thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses in Katmandu this week, and the authorities say that a new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC hurricane centre: 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A 60% probability of developing tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours is about 560 km from the southernmost parts of the Cape Verde islands, reported the National Hurricane Center (National Hurricane Center) on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Air Science Institute, there is also a clear centre of low pressure in the middle of Cape Verde and the Little Antilles. It can also become a 60% probability of tropical cyclone in the next two days.
Google intends to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced to launch a campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian aid organisations helping thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced the donation campaign in his blog in a particular personal way.
Instead of leading the campaign, a Google employee launched Rita Masoud by telling about his own experiences. He was only seven years old when he escaped from Kabul with his family.
"We traveled in the dark on the train and on the bus, and we were starving, thirsty, cold, and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
After the European refugee and migrant crisis has evolved in many similar situations, many families need help.
Gifts are assigned to non-profit organisations helping refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children ry and UN Refugee Organisation.
Once donations have been collected at google.com/refugeeriel through $5.5 million, Google promises to donate an equivalent amount, making the total up to 11 million.
The European Refugee Crisis has been the worst of the Second World War, which, in particular, exacerbates the four-year civil war in Syria, which has caused more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
Wars are also forced to flee Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
A new study suggests that mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from fatty surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics are living longer after fatty surgery than those receiving unoperated treatment.
"It takes time to get mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a veterinarian, who dealt with the new research in JAMA Surgery.
Fat surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach bag by different methods.
Chirurgical methods reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
During the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in type 2 diabetes. However, the majority of the studies have been related to patients with an overweight body weight index (BMI) of at least 35.
The weight index indicates the weight and length of which the normal value is between 18,5 and 24,9.
When the weight index is more than 25, the person is overweight and the weight index of over 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own weight index at 1.sa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, researchers from the hospital Min-Sheng in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two fatty surgery methods, gastric surgery and hydraulic surgery with mildly obese subjects for treatment of type 2 diabetes.
The mean weight index was decreased from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The mass index of patients treated with inoperable surgery remained close to 29.
Diabetic patients treated with surgery improved by 36% and partially by 28%.
In the treatment group, diabetes improved by only 1% and partially by approximately 2%.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the surgery group.
Studies also followed haemoglobin-A1c levels in patients, reflecting the development of blood glucose levels.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin A1c level is below 7%.
After surgery, haemoglobin A1c decreased from an average of 9% to 6%.
In the treatment-treated group, the value remained unchanged in approximately 8%.
Haemoglobin-A1c is an indication of control of blood sugar levels. However, the study group led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu concluded that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different cutting methods.
During the fifth year in the gastrointestinal surgery group, weight loss was higher than in the respiratory surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), weight index drops were higher (7.4 and 5.1), as well as haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1 per cent and 2.1 per cent).
However, a Swedish study from the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, however, shows that surgery takes years to fat people.
In the Swedish study, the likelihood of mortality was reduced by 29 per cent compared to the conventional treated group in 15 years.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, however, Blackstone confirmed that persons with a mass index below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding in the study, as it says that surgery is safe in the lower weight index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is 27 to 30.
"We wait too long for people to take the situation seriously," the researcher said.
"When the human body is surrounded by genetic changes that are exposed to fatty and diabetes, it is really difficult to turn the situation around."
"Everyone cannot come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leadership of Tibet’s Buddhist has called for the end of violence in the home of refugees.
The Dalai Lama dealt with the refugee crisis during its visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama held a speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai lama, in the current situation, humanity must be put ahead of individual countries or parts of the country.
He also stressed that, although the anti-reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is not sufficient in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," said the Dalai Lama in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions of Germany and Austria in a crisis situation, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"To take care of thousands of refugees is a wonderful act, but at the same time we need to reflect on long-term solutions and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," the Dalai Lama emphasised.
"In the end, we must consider how we can reduce killing in these countries.
The use of force must be reduced.
Power has never solved problems," he added.
In addition, when speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama commented on George Bush’s actions in connection with the 11th September terrorist attacks and claimed that, when he responded to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrolled event chain.
"After the attacks on the 11th of September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would come through violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used to use force with unpredictable consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Infringement cases in children four times a year
According to Georgia's poisoning centre, poisoning centres across the United States indicate that their alcoholic strength has increased by almost four-year-old cases of swallowing a heavy handset in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the director of Georgia’s poisoning centre, the cases of swallowing of the gloves reported to the poisoning centres in children under 12 years of age increased from 3 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are more and more accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children will be in emergency care," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink handcuffs on purpose, some to impress their friends and part of the social media.
YouTube videos include teenage people who drink disinfectants because of cheap drunk.
Teenagers are reported to mix alcoholic oral water with disinfectant in order to get a stronger drink.
Smaller children can be attracted to the smell of handcuffs.
"The child doesn't think it's bad," said Lopez.
" Most of the attractive handpiece products have just been perfumed.
There are decorative handmade products of strawberry, grape and orange that appeal to children."
The alcoholic strength of disinfectants is 45 to 95%.
A small amount of alcohol may cause alcohol poisoning for young children already.
"The alcoholic strength of the handides is very high," Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University Hospital of Kansas, told Fox 4 to Kansas City.
"No one would leave a whiskey scotch away from children, but if hand disinfection products are often left outside the reach of children, they will quickly receive a large amount of alcohol."
The six - year - old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four lorazed strawberries in school, and the girl was delivered to the first aid.
"The alcoholic strength of the unfinished blood was 179, which is twice as much as the adult’s hop limit," says a doctor who treated the girl from the Gwinnett Medical Center near Christey Atlanta.
Nhajah was sober and couldn't walk when he was brought to the emergency.
The doctors followed her place overnight in a separate child hospital for brain damage, because she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol," Ritchey told me.
"Your house was really scary," Nhajah's mother, Ortoria Scott, said to CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended the use of non-alcoholic products and disinfectants, in addition to the transfer of your handwriting to children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some of the disinfectants have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women of Ontario died after swallowing gloves containing toxic substances that were not reported.
The health authorities considered that the product contained deadly methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter is indicated as the active substance in the product label.
According to the police report, three fourth-class students in the northern part of the state of New York planned the killing of a "good" teacher by setting antibacterial products around the classroom in January.
The teacher is highly allergic to the handwriting and denied its introduction to the classroom.
The police considered that the plan that went away was insignificant and called for disciplinary activities.
No dissociation in the lines of Celtic
Griffith defyes the misconduct of the Celtic team, while Deila admits that it's not all right in the team, but she believes she's gonna make it right.
Hearts, in contrast with the SFA, for Neilson's punishment, and Warburton warns the game transfers in January so that the team's unity does not suffer.
The neck of Aberdeen, the five points of Celtic
ADAM Rooney's first half sentence brought a scarce victory to Aberdeen from Hamilton at the Pittodrie Stadium.
Griffiths' speeches of independence are neglected.
According to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not the target of observing when preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
"I don't think we're under any pressure, and I think the players are waiting for us to meet.
Hollanders want an old Scottish battle partner – de Boer
The former Rangers middle-field player and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have stated that the Dutch football fans' interest in Celtic has been lost because Celtic and Ranger's dual struggles are no longer allowed to be followed.
De Boer, working in the Ajax team, said: "The Celtic games are no longer presented in Holland.
'Cause Rangers is no longer involved."
"We don't just talk about the Rangers coming back here.
We're talking about Old Firm.
Hollanders need team-to-team twin fights.
The games of Old Firm have a huge tension and are also interested outside the Scottish borders."
I'll turn it over, Deila assures me.
Mr Deila admits that Celtic is difficult, but the Norwegian credit assures that there will be a change in the situation.
Malmölle lost company fell from the Masters League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, now with five points of leadership at the top of the table.
"Celtic's had hard episodes before, and we're getting up again," Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it causes anger or grief in many.
So do we, but we have to move on.
We urgently need the support of Celtic's supporters, as it will significantly strengthen players.
"A common spirit is really important now."
Warburton Careful in January Player Transfers
Although only a few weeks ago, the Rangers boss Mark Warburton pointed out January about the players' missions, he is careful about the transfer skateboard and says that he wants to jeopardise the team's unity.
"January player transfers differ significantly from summer transfers," Brentford's ex-coach said.
"The players associated with the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the beginning of the season, which has been successful in our composition this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessarily purchased players can cause the team more harm than benefit."
Michu about survival in Celtic
The Swansea attacker Michu has been attached to the Celtic player's playover speeches, and Michu has insisted on retiring after the end of the Swans agreement.
Michu, a 29-year-old, has been a profound ankle for years, and he couldn't get a move from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for the SFA Resistance from Neilson's comments
Hearts led to 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team eventually lost 3-2. The defendant's red card was subsequently cancelled. It is already the third Collum red card within eight months, which will be cancelled.
But Neilson stays behind his words, "I did not question honesty, and I did not comment on the performance.
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was reprimanded when the man confessed to his grazing songs from the former Hearts player Rudi Skakel.
The incident occurred in the pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local fight, and the mood was intense," the attacker said. "I can guarantee I'm not going back to Tynecastle except for Celtic's lines."
Tannadice Management Group believes in Dundee United Training Management – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures me that Dundee United's leadership can turn the situation to a better place.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes welcomes the Hamilton win with a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperately forced to hold against Hamilton for the seventh consecutive overwhelming victory, with the win of Aberdeen catching five points at the top of the Celtic series, which is a thank you for the punishment of Adam Rooney in the first half.
"There is no cup or overwhelming team that would not have won such games," said McInnes.
Unemployment continues in Scotland, growing in the British Islands
The number of unemployed persons in the United Kingdom increased by 164 000 at the same time.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent, compared to 5.5 per cent in the United Kingdom as a whole.
There are 12 000 fewer workers in Scotland than three months earlier, and the number of people working now is 2 612 000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74.0 per cent in the quarter, with an average employment rate of 73.5 per cent in the United Kingdom as a whole.
David Mundell, Minister of Scottish Affairs, commented on fresh figures: "The long-term management plan has created the basis for a strong economy."
Nearly a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to maintain the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: unemployment decreased.
Why am I following the execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, unless there is a legal basis for revocation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, what I don't hope, I'll sit in the execution room of the Oklahoma State State, when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation from a man’s best friend and, despite my shock, I accepted the invitation.
When the day is near, I'm terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought that this was how I could tell the truth about the death penalty.
The angle of vision would be unique.
Journalists are able to monitor executions in the United States and since there are more applications than places, the participants are selected at a macaber value.
Oklahoma has reduced suppliers' locations from 12 to five.
The chosen ones will follow the execution gently.
I can't do it.
I sit next to the closest friends of Richard Glossip. I have created a personal relationship with a man because we have spoken on the phone several months, and one visit took two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
According to prison staff, I can't be present both as a witness and as a journalist, so I can't include a notebook and a pen in order to make notes.
All I have to do is try to put the details in my mind.
A Oklahoma journalist accused me of endangering neutrality on Twitter.
"That's the point:
When you tell him the story of the condemned in a pleasant way, you'll get close to him."
I gave the reporter a different opinion.
The editor's wife admitted that she could have formulated her word more carefully, but still keeps me wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what I'm writing, and even if he's trying to order, I wouldn't do it.
I've told him he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international reporter who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will promote a movement against the death penalty.
Huffington Post's reporter Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast broadcast.
I am not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can't tell you Richard Glossip is innocent.
His action after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of helping him after the crime.
However, I believe it is very likely that man Glossip is not guilty of murder.
I absolutely believe that there was insufficient evidence for the cause of the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
You can read an independent description of other journalists' cases.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
He was attracted from the Canning River after a naked police hunt.
The Constable of Canning Vale remained dry when lureing a man up from Canning River.
The Perthician man's attempt to escape into low, dirt water, and a few metres away, the police got the man landed back on the dry land.
Canning Vale Police got a call on Tuesday from unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they discovered a suspect trying to punish the police by heading to the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water reported not to come out of the water and told the police to get him in the water," said the senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec was not attracted to the irrigation of a uniform, so he chose a safer tactic — the negotiation.
"On the other hand, the attempt to escape makes a person use of the most entertaining means," said Sergeant Castledine.
Football champion Ben Cousins' case is an interesting example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a police blow and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man’s attempt was condemned, but the pace inspired the locals to plan the Ben Cousins Biathlon.
Peter Moody says the agents tried to spy, and he's threatening to stop competing.
Peter Moody is blaming Racing Victoria's agents for a spy company last year, and he threatened to stop competition immediately.
Moody argues that the agents and the Racing Victoria Independence Department have personally attacked him, and the rejection of Lady Tatai due to recent treatment on the day of the race was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to act for competition. Moody has been in a difficult situation when he found cobalt in Lidar's sample, and he couldn't explain the discovery.
Moody has kept his tongue under control of spy charges for a year and a half, and he did not want the charges to be influenced by the bitter man's actions.
"I wasn't going to raise it up, and I thought about it for a long time, but sometimes frustration will go out by one shot," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the condition after I opened my mouth.
I'm going home and I'm sleeping good at night.
I want to go upright, and I want the horse owners to think I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't want to continue as a horse coach anymore.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in Racing.com's interview, where he told me about the independence department's spying companies in his stable.
"After a year ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my stable to spy on my actions." Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly think I'm a cheater.
If so, they should present the evidence, for I have not been caught of anything unauthorized.
Mr Roulston, former president of RVL, the current president of the RVL, David Moodie and the current CEO of RVL, Bernard Saundry, were aware of the activities at that time and now.
Should I consider it a personal chase?
Should the RVL take real action and devote responsibility to non-trainers?
Do I feel bad for the industry?
Do I really feel bad for the industry?
Maybe that's what many people think.
Maybe I'll still be a trainee's license and push me out of my duties, and there's no doubt I'm gonna get a lot of people to think with my speeches that way.
But I'm at the point that I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm pressing them to make their decisions.
My family supports me, and I can retreat."
The long-standing investigation of Lidar’s cobalt values and the recent abandonment situation eventually frustrated the coach so that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is known as the best coach of the unattended master, Black Caviar. The man described the rules of the race day as ridiculous after the horse's legs were unregulated with a clay roll.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for it," Moody said.
"The person in my staff wrongly put clay on the horse's leg.
There could have been a clay treatment last night.
It could have been done yesterday, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody can expect a three-month competition ban on non-regulated clay treatment that the organizers have started to deal with.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know the horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this is going too far," Moody said.
Detained from Cobram's crash site
The police have arrested a bike driver this weekend, a man who ran away from the crash site.
The cyclist was taken by a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital, and he had serious injury to the car when he hit him on Saturday morning at Murray Valley Highway.
According to the police, the man driving the car escaped from the place and left not to help the injured bike.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia signed up to the Shepparton police.
The man is likely to be charged with the failure of the obligation to stop and assist in traffic accidents and other traffic violations.
A 40 - year - old bike from Cobra is still in hospital care, and his condition is stable.
Coach of Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy refers to the wrestling of the opponents.
Coach of Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, considers the criticisation of its team's tackling game as two of the two overfavourable activities of NRL.
According to Sydney Roosters Coach Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm's wrestling to the misery of Melbourne's hosts in a racing fight in Sydney on Friday night.
Coach Wayne Bennett, Brisbane Broncos, covered a troubled reference to Storm Broncos winner at the Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a model match and said that in Queensland, more specifically, he did not deal with wrestling.
Bellamy defended his own team's tackling game and said they were just focused on the contact when they tucked.
Bellamy added that his trust in his own team added that the trainer of the two top teams criticized his team. Bellamy considers this as evidence that coaches are concerned about losing Storm.
"This thing is always coming up. I remember Trent Robinson said nothing about wrestling when his team won us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defence system or in our techniques all year long. The last six weeks we've only invested in the contact game and tacks, which has turned us to the rising.
Trent's been on his job for three years, and he may have been shocked because he has a great team that hasn't used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing is always coming up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is interesting football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne is talking about interesting football.
He compared his own team from Saturday to our Friday game and thought their game interesting," said Bellamy.
"In 2010, St Georgea received a great deal of criticism for her boring game. Wayne said that the review would not give him any moment.
Now he has a team that can play so-called football, especially his young people, with its fast midlife fighters.
That's the kind of football you want to play when the player-arsenal is like this.
He emphasised this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play in his style. Not all teams have central warriors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more confidence in this, when other coaches are so worried about meeting my team that they're going to get into this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that more paints were made in Storm and Roosters than in meeting Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the outcome? 16-12?
The end of our game was 20-18. We had more situations, but is it interesting football?
Or are gambling failures and necessity interesting football?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend, because the team will be able to visit North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday, the next Saturday at the AAMI Park.
A Serbian man freed up against $20,000 in a drug case
A man who has been smuggled to Queensland for 40 kilos of cocaine in possession of a possible life-long sentence has been released against $20,000 guarantees.
Marko Maksimovic, 29 was one of the five men arrested last month after the police found a hundred pounds of cocaine cargo from Solay, who had arrived through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at Coomera's port in August.
The police watched the meeting of Maksimovic and a co-criminal officer at the boat port for the morning and surpriseed a twin later in the Coomera Roadhouse Café. The Toyota Echo car on the parking lot was found 40 kilos of drugs.
Although maximovic expects a lifetime of possession of drugs for commercial purposes, according to his lawyer, there is no evidence that his client would have tried to take over the whole lot, but he may have been in a cafe for innocent purposes.
According to the Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maksimovic is trying to escape the country.
"Maximovic has clearly links with Serbia.
He travels often to Serbia," the judge stated in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his place of residence."
The mother and stepfather of Maximovic together paid 20,000 guarantees against which the man was released.
"After reading of the licensing certificates of both persons, it is clear that $20,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
"But it's not enough alone to prevent a man from escape," the judge warned.
Maksimovic was released under the condition that he would deliver his passports from both Australia and Serbia, report to the police daily and stay home from six o'clock to six o'clock in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to get the pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone to get pictures of the child abused.
Stevan Hogg took the girl on the phone while sleeping and logged in on an online message service where he got another user to send inappropriate images of children.
Later when she woke up, she noticed that the phone was gone, and she found it sleeping in Hogg’s hand.
When she explained the contents of her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
These five photos were reported to the police. After the computers found on the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches using search warrants for unconventional child images.
Hogg claimed to the police that he tried to mislead pedophiles on the Internet and presented the police with the aim of scaring the pedophiles.
At the local court office at Dundee Sheriff Court, the prosecutor Elidh Robertson said: "The man claimed he was dependent on intimidating people.
He admitted that he had made the graves on a computer, but he claimed that he did so to pretend to be a police officer and thus to be able to scare the pedofiels.
Hogg was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent the pictures to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead pedofiels.
He told me he had disturbing thoughts when he drank and wanted to watch pictures of rape and murders.
Robertson added, "After we found the messages on the phone, the girl screamed at her mother crying and crying."
She saw the wrong pictures on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
She told me that the defendant used the computer and the Playtaton to talk to girls who looked considerably younger than herself.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road acknowledged the accusations of the possession of unauthorized children's photos last June 14th year. Hogg violated his exemption against guarantees on 25 January this year and failed to receive a hearing on 24 March this year.
The defendant, Gregor Sim, asked Hogg not to register sexual offenders because it could be considered that there were no significant sexual features of the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the arrest to October due to social work background reports.
Hogg was granted an exemption against guarantees in this case, but he was held in prison for other reasons.
Hogg was added to the Sexual Criminal Register before the date of the judgment.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is having the wrong speech in Parliament.
Mugabe, the oldest head of state in Africa, fell in the stairs leading to the talker’s high school earlier this year.
Mugabe didn't get hurt, but the video of what happened quickly spread in the social media.
Parliament's opening parties were also hampered by the allegations of the opposition legislators that they have received anonymous threats of killing in order to warn Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, the Members of the People's Party burst and interrupted the speech on the situation of the President's state in Parliament, and the President held the same speech on Tuesday.
The Prime Minister of the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages, in which they were urged not to disturb Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the message title is "death," Gonese told the journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns the recipients that outside Parliament representatives are no longer within immunity.
The party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving measures for business services.
The HP will be divided into two stock exchange companies later this year and will distinguish computer and printer business from faster growing business equipment and services.
According to the HP bulletin, the company records the unit costs of EUR 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter.
"The new arrangements will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP, who runs the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more concentrated company than the present HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of transactions that help companies to move to a new business style." Whitman said.
"As our own company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is more than $50 billion and the company is focused on its mission to provide unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
The company founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard at Stanford University in the 1930s is now divided into two. The two founded an electronics company in Palo Alto, now considered the birth of Piilaakso.
The HP has carried out massive reorganisations when switching from traditional desktop computers to mobile devices.
The changes of the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and the HP in the largest technology companies in the United States are the most recent transfer in a sector that believes that concentration will bring success.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilsher that it is only September. If everything goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to skip at least the next four British country teams. His participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear in the history of a man.
The biggest regret of the last problem is that Wilshere has decided the last season strongly after ankle damage and it seemed to have burned back in the past under the new season.
"This is not the type of injury that threatens the career," Wenger said.
"Lulu didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or past hurts."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wenger also pointed out, additional injury may occur when the player tries to return to the field during the season.
There is also an unpleasant rule here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different kinds of troubles since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in Arsenal's rows only in 65 of the 157 gay games in the last five seasons.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that from the period 2007-2008, the team has been the second of the teams who lost money since the most injured.
Wenger accepts a possible witch, but Arsenal believes that last season improved injury statistics continue to develop in a better direction.
"Sometimes the return to the post-injuries can be associated with a vulnerable period, in which the body must be strengthened and competition powers are sought," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he's gonna get through this.
I hope that he will balance his body, and I believe in it, and it will continue his career as he deserves."
Arsenal starts his career at the Master's League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday. Wenger will prepare small changes to the assembly.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are the likely starters.
Wenger can also place a start-up in Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in the place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give them time to rest," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the F group, Maximer Zagreb has the most frightening stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been invincible for 41 games in the team.
The Stadion was shaken on Tuesday night when the land was swinging at a speed of 3.2 Richter's scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his last season's lesson when he has had to turn to Monaco, and he is also still motivated by a far-reaching desire to retaliate the team towards the European championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"The Arsenal hasn't hit this title yet.
On the other hand, we were very close in 2006, with experience, I am also realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us truths about male friendship
A similar description shines from his absence in other series, which is remarkable, especially in the light of the need for men to open more than ever, and the suicide statistics for young men are at the highest for 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the major cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Britain. Suicide is three times more common among men than women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) takes advantage of the problem by declaring 2015 men for a year. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed. The study has shown that there are better chances of healing people with depressive symptoms if there are enough healthy people around them.
The prevalence of asymptomatic people was also half-prone if there were no mental health problems in their surroundings.
However, friendships are the basis for everything.
Today’s communication is dominated by social media, and communication styles are often more important than content. Rapid responses are often considered to be more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need to appear strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
Costs, money, image and social status are linked to surface success. All of them pay attention to internal values and our natural longing for personal growth and friendship. Internal values are more deeply influenced by our mental health.
A millionaire in the video gaming industry recently noted that money can actually not buy happiness.
The fineness of the French was that the series turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters in the series were defined not by the profession, but by personality. This was seen in friendships.
In the series, the humorist act was Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football on their TV chairs, and we saw Ross often miss Rachel.
One volunteer explained to me: “When I hear people who are depressed and suicidal, I have become clear how much the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often can't talk to their friends.
The traditional idea of men being responsible for doing so is strong, and a man is easily considered weak if he speaks about his problems."
"Frends are one of the series of long-term survival mechanisms.
In a series, the small moments of inter-man friendship were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can provide help from outside in a moment of despair, but long-term support is obtained from the neighbourhood of friends and family."
In honor of Comedy Central FriendsFest, the set of sets has been revitalised. If you take part in the event this weekend, you should take your friends to Central Perk.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can get out of it.
Comedy Central sends the whole French series – all 236 episodes – for the glory of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped the PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates the goal against Malmö with Blaise Matud and Edinson Cavan.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in the painting of the Master's too debut and helped the PSG hit the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and review.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were hit when Paris Saint-Germain began their work in the Master's League by hitting Malmö Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made a goal when the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. She confirmed the position of the French champions immediately in the hand. However, the PSG knocked out a number of destinations before finally they could add to their lead: Cavani painted after the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The A section also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so the PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG is not only seeking a further place in the drop games, but also wants to improve its positions for the three remaining quarter rounds.
Although the SPG captured the points, the match was not a perfect show for the team that Laurent Blanca had fired. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the landing place and the man had to change when he faced his former home company, where he started his great career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or in guests, so the 2-0 wins and good gains will give us a good basis, even though we still have a traitory season," Blanca said.
"This is good.
We were thirsty to win, and we were able to do it, but it's sad that we couldn't do one or two extra paintings."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team's rows after he was injured. The team had to be satisfied by 2-2 in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux this weekend. Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in the shadow of four minutes.
Last month, the Argentinian pier from Manchester United to the PSG was appointed as a solving officer of the PSG, which lifts the team to a new level in Europe. He proved to be worthy of the name by controversy of the ball from Marco Verratt's feeding past the Malmö defense and then swept the exact target to the back of Johan Wland.
However, those who were expecting to win the PSG were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in drop games, marched into the field from the start of nine international players. A team playing the defence of five men and two attackers' tactics was difficult to win.
Nikola Djordjic's shot passed very little by the back of Kevin Trapp's goal at the 34th minute of the game.
Instead, the PSG fell into undue feeding and weak finishing, and not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five destinations only in the first half of the time. At the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic was fired by Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his nails in the delivery game. Di Maria shot a torrent by Wiland by 52 minutes of the feeding of Ibrahimovic.
The second goal was born at the time of the county, thanks to Cavani.
Malmö's letter ended with another goal, and only Wiland's top defense from close distance to David Luiz to shoot the shooting was controlled, and the goal of Ezequiel Lavezz from the exchange bank was completely abandoned on the end.
Malmön shot Åge Hareide later admitted that the PSG was his own class. "We played the game of the previous Master League in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league where the level is not the same.
It's not enough.
A hat for the Parisians.
This was a great fight for them."
Glencore collects 2.5 billion dollars in stock.
The Swiss mining waste Glencore, which was tested by the lower raw materials prices, collected USD 2.5 billion in the mid-term shareholding as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, stated in its statement that he sold new shares at about 1,6 billion pounds in order to reduce debt.
The market value of the company declined this year by 57 per cent, and the company is wrestling with the deterioration of raw materials when the downturn of the Chinese economy undermines demand and burdens the market.
As a result, Glencore’s stock price tended to begin the morning on Wednesday at the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The share rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up to 0.69 per cent.
Last week, Glencore announced its intention to collect $2,5 billion in stock as part of a strategy to reduce its debt of $30 billion by a third.
The company sold new shareholders at 125 cents, with 2.4 per cent of the closure price on Tuesday.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a total value of up to 9.99% of the total group.
Concerning the economic recession in the PRC, the price of iron beads has collapsed to the side, whereas the decrease in carbon, copper and other goods has been between 20 and 40 %.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
The Communication published by the White House on Tuesday confirms that President Xi Jinping of China is travelling to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives for his first official visit to Washington on 25 September. This is a similar visit to President Barack Obama v in Beijing last November.
After the bilateral discussions of the Heads of State, the President of the United States and his wife, Michelle Obama, organise dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, for the honor of a state visit.
"Press Xi Jinping's visit allows us to expand cooperation between the United States and China in the area of global, regional and bilateral topics of interest to both sides, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the opportunity to discuss constructive discussions on issues that are disagreed with," says the White House Communication.
The first visit to Xi Jinping was announced in February, and he is expected to bounce in Seattle to meet a number of US leaders in the field of technology, from Seattle to Washington and from there to New York at the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and Xin are expected to raise a number of controversial topics, such as Washington's concern about the alleged cyber spying of China and the increased activity of the country in the disputed waters of South China.
Matt Damon is declining diversity in film work.
Matt Damon talked with African-American Effie Brown and said that there was no need for diversity behind the camera.
Brown was interrupted by an actor in the HBO Project Greenlight section on Sunday night, explaining how important it is to take into account the different views of the main character of the project.
"The multitude is taken into account in the role of the film, not in the role of the program," said Damon.
Brown was stabbed and wounded by the claim. "Wow, that's clear," she said the one film on Mars, after Damon's comment.
Damon and Brown were meeting with other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers to discuss the finalists of the contest.
"Whoever is a director, I would like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character is displayed," Brown said at first.
"The only dark character is a prostitute who has sex with a white pimp."
The Dear White People producer supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as directors of the film, and Damon hardly replied that the choice of a twin could lead to a negative outcome.
When the debate was presented on television, the social media exploded on Damon’s devastating comments.
MrPoon, a Twitter user, expressed his anger about the scene in direct words: "The fact that Matt Damon speaks to the only dark person in order to explain what diversity is, is such a highlight of whiteness that makes pain."
The TV was distributed more than 5,000 times, and it was liked 4 000 times.
Damon's comments come at a time when a balanced representation of human races in the media is one-toe.
After Michael Brown, a teenager, died from a white police bullet in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement received support throughout the country.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the circulation of the year's album candidates at the Grammy galaxy.
"The Albume still matter," he said.
"As in books and the lives of dark people, albums are still important."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter issue published the opinion as a response to the question by Mr Fow News on whether this group should be characterised as a group of hatreds.
"Black Lives Matter network is a group of love-based people," said the leader of the movement.
Damon is one of those entertainment artists, producers and media mogules who have been invited to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the western countries.
It's not known whether Damon responded to the invitation.
