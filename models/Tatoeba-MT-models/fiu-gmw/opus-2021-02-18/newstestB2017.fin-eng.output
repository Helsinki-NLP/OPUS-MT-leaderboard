A 28-year-old cook was found dead at the Sanfranciscola mall.
The 28 - year - old cook, recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairs of the local shopping centre this week.
The brother of the victim says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally gotten his business straight."
The body found at the Westfield mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old sanfranciscola Frank Galicia.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
Victim’s brother Louis Galicia told the KGO radio station of ABC in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as cook in Boston, had found his dream job when he released the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant as a kitchen master six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters Restaurant said that death was a shock for all of them.
"We're a small, tight team, like a family, and we're so badly big," says the representative.
"We're with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells Frank first lived in the hostel, but he had finally settled his business.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," he told Louis Galicia to the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and hearty.
His way of being together with the family was to put food for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went along with the power.
Despite all the injustices in the world, he was an impeccable diamond that sparked every day," he says.
Everyone who knows about the case is asked to call the San Francisco police clue number 415-575-4444.
New work campaigns are required by statutory trainee doctors
Representatives of British junior doctors (own principally specialist doctors in Finland) have called on their trade union and asked for permission for new work activities in the event of a new employment contract.
The JDC Committee of Students of the British Medical Association (BMA) is requesting its entire government to support further work activities from the beginning of September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in July.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday night on Twitter, Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Committee on Human Rights, published a letter to the JDC members in which he says that the government was "strongly weakened" on issues that, according to McCourt, led to the fight against the agreement.
The letter says: "In this context, the JDC Government has voted against the new draft agreement and calls for new formal negotiations on all our concerns.
In response to the weakening of the government, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA Government, asking for permission for the least advanced work activities since the beginning of September."
Due to the dispute, Junior doctors have already been in a strike six times this year, including the first full work stops ever seen in the history of the UK public health system.
Johann Malawana, Head of Senior Medical Arts of BMA, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
Malawana told the members of BMA at the pre-decision meetings that the agreement was good and should be accepted. 54 000 students and students from medicine attended the vote.
After the vote, Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would come into force and that it would apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that decided the crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met in their hands for reconciliation and formally finalising the eight-month war of vocabulary and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin took up his Turkish ministerial brother in the gold hall of his Palazzo Peter, I had a clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The parties did,
But Putin's smile looked thin, and he didn't seem to have any warmth on him, even with his own restraining standards.
On the other hand, Mrs Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of her "good friend" Mr Putin – one report said five times.
I didn't keep the bills myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper of our country wrote Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I understood his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But Putin's blinking continual vileys showed that the Russian headman has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat plane at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the event time was fierce.
Puti attacked hardly, I said, against Ankara, and accused him of stabbing his back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Recovery of true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the most controlled media in the state took a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the reason for everything.
The most serious was the accusations of top officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in Isisi’s controlled areas in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the accusations.
However, the official message from Peter was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was only held to allow Putin to receive his apology from President Erdogan.
So Russia could have gained some kind of victory.
The advantages of declaring an ankara firearm are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost removed last month from power in a failed coup.
Her repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken her too.
There is also a financial impact on the agreement.
Russia's sanctions have severely attacked Turkey, especially the charter flight ban, as there are usually millions of Russian tourists traveling to the Turkish coast every year.
The figure has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, travel operators and charter companies will certainly be reluctant to the relief when air traffic can eventually be continued.
They're putting their faith in the late season for the attack on the Mediterranean.
And yet this week, national television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall when imports of agricultural products from Turkey are allowed again.
"You traveled there, the tomatoes back here," was formulated in the article of the economic magazine Vedemost.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, because the West thinks she reacted insanely to a coup.
Without forgetting the old appetite of the Turkish EU membership negotiations and the intervention of Putin, which is eager to take advantage of the cool spaces and to break the Turkish bonds to the west.
There is no doubt that the Russian leader won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the coup.
This was obvious to Moscow, who had its own concern about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey, when they met in the pramé in the seafarm, could convey a picture that an analyst described as a 'exterior alliance': two countries who experience being rejected by the West and have been mistreated.
Despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between these two.
The most important is Syria, where Moscow has created itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It says much that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both Presidents were told at a press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The President of Turkey decided to refuse to answer the question of differences between the countries, while Mr Putin emphasised them in turn.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek an agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a complete disaster caused by the NATO Member State Turkey when shooting down a Russian combat machine, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State are even again speaking.
The Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the President of the RBS Bank, the bank’s activities outside Scotland will be reduced in such a way that it will continue to offer only business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand originally joined the global objectives of the bank.
The bank had to retreat when it collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that period, brandists have used RBS to protect other consumer financial bands.
It sponsors millions of pounds of international sports, for example Six Nationsrugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to release more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but no shortage of RBS will be used.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted to NatWeste, with the exception of the main office and the stock list.
The brand Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller brands of private banking activities that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during the presentation to customers and staff in Inverness Shire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS turns into an investment brand and because of the staff we have, because we are now becoming much more a bank of different brands.
Since the bank became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Our efforts now are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our staff work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it would stop sponsoring Six Nationsrugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sponsoring sports.
"This is the time to turn into a bank containing different brands, because it is essentially the question of how we can make the bank better for customers," says the President-in-Office of the Bank.
"It would have been very rude three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and have introduced brands.
But the work we have done and the focus on customers' needs instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time."
Frankie Dettor riding on Predilection to win in Newmarket and gained 3 000.
Dettor showers champagne after he wins twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant the 3 000th victory for him.
Jockey Frankie Dettor confirmed his 3000th victory in the British Championship series on Friday in Newmarket.
This spring he reached by riding on his horse twice to win the same night on the path of his own locality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettor, 45, is the sixth jockey, which reaches this pelagic track in running competitions.
He had the same thing before, sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-fold masterjockey Dettor, who used to win in Ghayyr, says, "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I'm very glad this happened in New Market, because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The event is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20 000-spirited audience.
I'm relieved, and I feel great humiliation."
Dettor accepts the Hurahs with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached a peach in the essay competitions, and they are masterjockey Richard Johnson and 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4 300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, 9-fold Derby winner, 4 493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it's not surprising that he just reached this rocktop, which only few have reached.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical advancement is what distinguishes him from others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race, his enthusiasm and his chasm has brought supporters to the species for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that she would have won 6 000 races if she didn't only compete on weekends and only on big races!
Seriously, Frankie's horse riding career in the British races has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a living person, which is good for British competition, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettor ventilated his achievement in a symbolic way by jumping airplane down his horse’s back.
"From flights to flights to airplane downwards, Frankie Dettor has been a model for British competition for two decades.
There's been up and down the road.
He has won a number of big races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived the flight accident and has been banned because of drug abuse.
When the competition ban ended three years ago, he had difficulties at first, but he showed the admirable strength of the character, showed his suspects and returned to his best.
And for a while, he has not finished his career – Dettor has recently said that he would like to continue the competition until at least 50."
Putin fired Chief of Administration Sergei Ivanovin
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov, his head of administration.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin's trusted inside for many years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to the Kremlin press release, President Putin "decide to release Ivanov as Head of the Russian Presidential Board", but no justification for redundancy was stated.
Vice-Chef of Ivanov was appointed to the task of Anton Nano since 2012.
The persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Geneno, born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the renowned Moscow National Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he was headed by the President's Protocol Department and government office, says Kremlin's Russian website.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment with the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State, which means to make drafts of law and to monitor the implementation of your instructions."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov had asked for a divorce and recommended persecution as his successor.
Are smiles real?
This transfer has led to a confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has been in the closest district of Vladimir Putin for a long time, and, like Putin, he also has a KGB history.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, the Russian state television, both said that Ivanov would withdraw from the task on his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations assure only a few, particularly under the parliamentary elections.
Are firing a result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that the man who has been glorified as a possible president would suddenly like to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "After 2012, I asked you to give me this extremely complex and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
Now I've been the president's head of administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
When Putin acted as Head of Security Service (FSB) replaced by the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed as his Deputy Head of Security.
When Putin entered power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become Russian President Putin after the second season, because the Constitution would have prevented the choice of Putin for the third period.
However, the mission went to another neighbour of Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister, and then only three and a half years later he returned to the president.
Criminal Minds – FBI researchers – Star Thomas Gibson was fired after a hit producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produce the series, reported their fires in their joint communications.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner had apologized on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened," he says in his briefing.
The information about how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later in the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously in the comedy series Dharma & Greg played the 54-year-old Gibson has been involved in a series since its first production period, which is since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds, and I have put my heart and soul in it for the last 12 years," says Gibson in his release on Friday.
"I was hoping I could see the show until the end, but it's no longer possible.
I would like to thank all the manuscripts, producers, actors, our great production group and the most important: the best fans that the show could ever have hoped."
The 12th production season of the series starts in the United States on 28 September.
Mysterious beaching of fish into the Banffia garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that the 75 fish are windfish that have been caught in the land by a storm.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seaside, published image material in Periscope and hoped to receive an answer to the appearance of these five - mile of fish.
From Queensferry's crossroads now connected to Fife
The project is now to be completed by May 2017 at a price of 1.35 billion pounds.
The engineers have connected Queensferry to the northern canal and the ground bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four parts between the "citizens" which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge part of Fifesta is now 600 metres tall and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 straps.
The project is now to be completed by May 2017 at a price of 1.35 billion pounds.
Minister Keith Brown, responsible for the economy, visited the workground today and was one of the first ones who could walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry overnight.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, and more than 30 000 concretes and steel have only been used to build this bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge between the bridge and the bridge is a subtle operation requiring extremely precise installation tolerances.
The entire bridge is now almost 79%, and the rest of the cover is getting its concrete crude in Rosyth today, which means that the cover is ready to be lifted up."
Michael Martin, head of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: "The first part of the bridge is always a significant urinary plum in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the top of the road and water building industry.
After the last part of the roadside was installed and attached to the North Tower pillar, then we had to close the remaining northern part (i.e. the earthside).
This was done by pulling 700 millimetres south of the northern terrain.
This was a massive operation, and at the same time a high level of precision.
Massive because the ground has a length of 222 metres and a weight of about 6 000 tonnes and had to be pulled up in about 3 per cent climatic angles.
And demanding high precision because the tolerances that the working team had to do were very small — only a few millimeters.
Lucky fortunately, everything went well."
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department tells us about the miracles of three men.
In front of Anglesey, the three men who were caught in the water from their fishing boats saved like a miracle.
The Moelfre RNLI Marine Rescue Station was alerted on Friday at 13.20 p.m. on the local time of the accident observed by its crew in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely while their boat continued to travel recklessly without a director.
"We saw the boat rotating right next to them, and we imagined the worst," says the Moelfree rescue boat drives Vince Jones.
"By the time we got into the water, fortunately, the strong winds had brought the boat away from them."
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the third, 60 years old, was found as exhausted as a pod and without life vests.
They were all taken into a coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle that these three men who are in the water are still alive and perfectly well.
The boat’s engine had an emergency shutter, but for some reason it had removed the boat from the man’s time when he fell.
They were really lucky on their trip."
Pokémon Go hunt brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
During the last decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather stay inside staring at their squares.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, it took only TV viewing, and then there came video games and the latest smartphones.
So it is wonderful to note that technology and the outer movement do not exclude each other.
This, of course, refers to Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is a game application whose characters originate from the video game created in the 1990s (which later also were made by drawing series, game cards and other by-products).
Like many popular cultural events, it also stole a little before the new game was made available at the beginning of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
Lanseration in other countries was delayed because of the vast interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of the Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
So how does the game work?
In short, players will go out looking for pokémons on their smartphones that are monitored by GPS. When they find the pokémo, it can be "lighted" (with a screenshot of the phone) or "captured".
The wildness has embraced a generation of video games when he was younger and raised the back of the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the rate of "a average person" taking a day.
Washington Post recently told me about the Apple Watch cardiogram application, which observed within two days of the game's launch, that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35,000 users.
The company doesn't know who the users are playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data of the exercises.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get out of the couch and move at least 30 minutes a day have gone to deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers seemed unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be reduced.
Regularly moving people are less likely to suffer from cancer or depression.
Exercise helps to control weight, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a great deal of other benefits.
The fineness of the Pokémon Go game is that it makes people do something they enjoy.
This is how it achieves three basic health support — exercise, fresh air and sun and joy.
During the yacht, it is possible to have even new friends.
As usual, this phenomena also exacerbates joymakers.
And yes, someone can walk by the door when they play.
What about that?
There's been a breakthrough.
For even though smartphones like Fitbit were able to monitor your activity in the past, they did not allow us to move, as Pokémon Go does.
The news is disappearing, and the use is decreasing in time.
However, the success of the pokémons will result in more games that combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles caught gold in a multiplayer game of women's feminine tension.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the jump.
Simone Biles is immune to all these people.
Dynamic jump.
It's an uncomfortable store.
The chin's gonna lick with the perfume.
Great for everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old tenth ten-year-old actress won the multiplaying championship on Thursday and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic lighting.
His overall point was clearly better than the "Final Five" teammate in silver on Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronsimitalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles in the United States is presenting in the final of the individual competition for women's tennis sports on Thursday, Rio 2016 in the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth successor and the fifth American woman of all times, who won the multiplayer championship, so he strengthened his reputation as the best of his generation or even the best of all times.
Biles burst into tears when his finale’s total point became visible and his long path ended at this moment.
The achievement brings the species into completely new dimensions and brings him into the same category as other superstars of sport, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely overwhelming in his species for the last three years. He has won 15 world championships, of which 10 golds, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that Mary Lou Retton, the Olympic winner of 1984, said to him "the greatest tennis champion of all times".
There was one last competition left in Brazil, which, above all, took place between Biles and his own and the burden of overwhelming expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring, Texas, with less than coural gold medals would be a disappointment.
The United States Simone Biles (lower) and Aly Raisman hugging gold and silver at the final of the multiplayer competition of women's tennis sports in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, 2016.
Biles won the first gold milita on Tuesday as a point on i for the students of Martha Karoly who coordinated the country team and now retired.
Although Biles claimed that nothing had ever thought of in advance when he was on the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Some of his permanto program, which contains a volt series known as his master card, has been adapted to Latin music, which may well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
When their grandparents were young, Adopted and coach Aimee Boorman's mother has been found as a force figure. Borman found a girl when she was on a day-to-day trip to the gym where Boorman trained.
He has not lost any multiplayer competition since summer 2013, and the profit pipe will probably continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got into a small lead on two tours, it was like fabrication.
The rest of it was the boom and the perfume where Biles is a defensive world champion.
He returned to the leading position after gaining 15.433 points from the tree, and crowned the final result by 15.933 points from his permanence.
Raisman despised him gently while waiting for the final points — which was just a formality — and tears began to appear in the red, white and blue Biles, when the dream written in his copy came true.
Raisman’s performance was a small revanch for a competition four years ago when he first divided the third place, and then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the rerun.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader that the Americans call the "mother" of the team was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent his flights to the public after his permanto programme and thus rose from a loss position to a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old twittery, which was previously made in the past week, has now completely new meaning:
Police report three musics as the victim of a serial killer who listened to the car.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in the most devastating massacre in Phoenix for ten years. The victims sat in the car and listened to music when they were shot, reports a police report published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the 12th of June.
The shooter stood on the side of the car, from which he fired eight shots on a handgun and then fled with another car, says in the bulletin.
The police suspect that the cause of the triangle was probably not a robbery, because the attacker did not take the handbags or the 2 900 dollars that were found in the hearing of the other adult victim.
The Phoenix police reporter, sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether the death is linked to four earlier attacks.
Overall, seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks, mostly in the regions populated by Latin Americans within four months.
Howard told the CBS subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, the black BMW in the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists do not want to reveal what led them to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and that the same person is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The witness told the police that the triangle had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a note indicating only half an hour before the triple death of an empty car. The shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
Scouts found robbers and put a bullet in the car's seat and a bullet in the engine space.
The mother of a six-year-old boy with microchephalia: "She's getting better."
Like most of the 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other age mates, Edmund has microchephalic, or birthy minority, due to the genetic disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto, which he was not aware of when she was pregnant.
"When I brought Edmund home for the first time, my first thought was that I wouldn't get through this.
I can't get through this.
I didn't commit to this.
What is not true at all – of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never identify them and perhaps not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far that they suggested that the child be placed in the institution.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was any more such practice," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a roller.
Edmund just got up and started to ride until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly moving on his own path.
He walks with help and drives a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth is presenting Edmund's invented land with which she means "sing me."
"We'll teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean a common language, but it also includes the violins created by Edmund himself.
Microcephalia may have a number of different diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as malignancies or zicavirus.
There are great variations in the organs and forecasts.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the life of those infected with the zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional storm caused by the uncertain future.
"I kept watching, "what happens to us,
"what happens to us."
He still doesn't know.
"I haven't been asking for a prediction in a while, because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has some hope for mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the Zicavirus.
"The things are getting better.
It's the way things work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Strong rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared emergency rains and widespread floods. More rains in the state are expected on Saturday.
According to the national weather service, several rivers in Southeast Louisiana and South Mississippi flooded over their novels and spread to a wide area as a result of strong rains.
Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana tells us that state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, informant of the National Security and Emergency Governor's Office, reports that the Agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sands.
According to Steele, only the County of Tangipahoa has asked for dozens of thousands of sands.
The flood warning will remain in force until Saturday in most South Louisina.
According to the information provided by the weather service, water may be added to the area by 76-127 mm.
In South Alabama, a flood warning was given on Friday when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
During the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, is projected to rise to record heights.
According to the weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses on riverside may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that floods in the Ascension district constitute a threat, for the floods slowly evacuate into Lake Maurepas Lake.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, the Tickfaw River flowing south of the state of Mississippi was already higher on Friday at 9 a.m. than ever.
The rescue work continued in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the Southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law, were earlier on Friday close to Gloster.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He had been warned by the other bachelor party nearby.
"We got up, and the water came with a constant feed," says Hansford.
"It went to my belt."
His wife had told Hansford that he had never seen a river rise so high during the 48 years that he has lived in the area.
Hansford tells us that he and his family are all injuries, and he is the only one with swimming skills.
The rescue workers had saved all three large military-style trucks and took them to the fire station Gloster, where they kept protection on Friday.
The weather forecaster Krautmann says that floods are rapidly spreading as the rain continues, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He reports from a observer near Livingston that it had rained almost 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says that the soil was severely wet after the rains that started on Wednesday.
Authorities report that the flooding of heavy rains and streets made it necessary to save the inhabitants of the district of Tangipahoa from their homes and to cancel school hours in five school districts.
A member of the City Council of Tangiboha had told WWL, a subsidiary of the TV and radio company CBS, that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both of them.
Robby Miller, head of the district, reports that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pet animals who had remained prisoners of the flood.
The evacuators have opened shelters in the cities of Amien and Hammond.
"They can return to their homes when the water begins to retreat," he says.
In Hammond’s district in Tangipahoa, nearly twenty streets were to be closed because of the flood, and the inhabitants were offered sand holes to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"For the last time we experienced a great flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, member of the municipality.
"This flood seems to be the same."
In Mississippi, the rain continued evenly on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, says Rupert Lacy, the rescue director of Harrison County.
Lacy reports that on Thursday, there was reports of a handful of flooded houses, but on Friday, there was no information yet.
The head of the Shopper Value Foods store, Keith Townson, tells us he's been living in the area of Amite for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and it's raining all the time."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who had several bullets in his body, survives the Philadelphia shooting scene.
According to the police, there's been a six-year-old boy in Philadelphia who's already another six-year-old who's been shot in town this week.
The grandparents of the child told me the boy was Mahaj Brown on CBS Philadelphia.
According to his grandparents, he had several wounds in his ankles, legs, arms and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said his grandma Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital, and several surgery has been carried out.
The family tells the television company that they think he's gonna make it.
He was starting the first class at the local subclass.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in Germanytown.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also targeted.
The second 29-year-old state was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found on the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical state.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are now examining whether one of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The scene was filled with raid types from various attack weapons.
"It is absolutely clear that this was the ongoing battle.
On the street, there were shells on both sides of the pavement.
There have been a number of armed fighters and they have been actively involved in the shooting," said Captain Anthony Ginald of Philadelphia to the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
There have been no arrests, and the police have been told that they're going through surveillance videos.
Another one of the shooting victims in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl whose hand was misguided when she played her home on Tuesday in the West Oak Lane district.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is the name I call the Olympical Team for Women's Tennis Forces, and there are more than one reasons.
Firstly, I have been in every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been as overpowered as now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren's "Laurie" Hernandez, have been enthusiastic for many colored girls.
Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia are complemented by the team's composition, making everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
In the last four years, the best female liner has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were in towns 1 and 2.
This is great.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas was the surprising winner of the races, and the whole of America hurrated.
Now the world has been able to prove the impressive performances of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and the surprising and masterpiece programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth successive American who won gold in the women’s individual race.
Aly Raisman, teammate, won silver on his behalf.
Such views are at the top of the species, but the same does not appear in the tensile gymnastics courses throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same marks as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five, 'Final Five', because the next Olympic team in the tentary training will have only four gymnastics, and this is the last year of Marta Karoly as coach.
The reality is, however, that a tennis gymnast is expensive sports and gymnastics practice mainly in private tennis gymnastics, which are maintained by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, spaces, trips, performances, competition fees, hotel fees (trainers, gymnastics and family members) etc.
Most of the tentary tenures are located in prosperous residential areas capable of supporting activities.
The teaching of supervisors takes place in these clubs, and it means expensive and long-term commitment to the families of the gymnastics.
Coach Simone Biles Aimee Borman and Coach of Laurie Hernandez, Maggie Haney, have both coaches of the species since they started working on a career.
We need to organise a more costly and better available curriculum for the vast number of young girls whose enthusiasm is raised by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own tent of telegrams 20 years ago.
My organizations in Harlem have offered free or affordable opportunity to tending more than 15 000 urban youths (mostly black and Latin Americans), and these young people have been attracted to national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my home town, Detroit, so that we can offer high-quality tensions to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this magnificent Olympic species.
Teaching training develops strength, hiccupness and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lifelong benefits and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has raised enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start tennis training, and it is absolutely awesome.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girlpower" you showed when you won the Olympic Gold, and for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way into a prosperous, strong and successful young woman.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes.
Ministers wished to decide on the changes to pay and working conditions by accepting the renewed agreement with the BMA (British Medical Association), but 58% of the so-called Junior doctors who took part in the vote rejected the proposal.
In July, the Minister for Health Hunt told about the plans to make the agreement obligatory and said that the UK public health system (NHS) is "not in anyone's country" and that any further delays would be harmful to the staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are switching to a new agreement, which contains changes to the practice of night and weekend work in order to improve health in social times.
Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Committee on Students of BMA, delivered a opinion last night, saying: "Junor doctors are still very prepared for the proposed agreement, with particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it does not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new treaty, so now we have to move forward, because time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has been unwilling to discuss the discussions and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
Even though Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, repeal the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this is not the case, Junior doctors are ready for new measures to be taken."
At the end of April, the last strike postponed nearly 13 000 routine measures and 100,000 reception periods when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support the strike doctors.
The Ministers hoped that they would conclude the dispute on changes by concluding the renewed agreement with the workers of the United Kingdom's trade union representing doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54 000 junior doctors that would be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS employees, called on Junior doctors not to take new strikes.
Mortimer says: "The action is very little or nothing, but it creates pressure on the teams and services already operating at extreme borders and causes concern, distress and disruption for patients, care staff and their families.
For the past two months, we have been consulting with the Committee on Students, and together with the Ministry of Health and other bodies, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the overseer and the exploration of the malfunctions.
Workers were keen to hope that the continued positive commitment to other important topics, such as development, flexibility of education, additional training of workers returning from careers, training costs, mutual recognition of the educational programme, study-free and gender pay gap in the management sector, was a sign of the seriousness of workers, Health Education England, and the Ministry of Health wish to maintain agreements with BMA in November, February and May."
A daily approximate medicine of € 2.40 can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are receiving approximately 2.40 € per day when the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and longer-term use.
The anticoagulation medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with cardiac disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or a new heart attack.
The NICE (NHS) (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) has indicated that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further.
But the NICE (NHS) has now indicated that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems even further.
In England, about 140,000 people get a heart attack each year, one in four of whom will recur or have a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances that accumulate in the walls of the blood vessels, which produce plaques.
If the plaque breaks, it may cause a blood clot that prevents the blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot is removed, it can pass through the bloodstream and prevent the blood flow into the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is higher in people who have received multiple heart attacks.
The ticagrelor produced by the British AstraZeneca, sold by the product name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of tulps.
The NICE programme published today recommends that ticagrelor should be administered for the next 12 months, then reduced to 60 milligrams and aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, who is assessing the introduction of treatment methods (NICE) says: "Although effective treatments to prevent disease progression and symptoms are available, up to a quarter of those who have had a heart attack, receive a new seizure or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of recurrence can have a very negative effect on the quality of human life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for the temporary use of ticagrelor will increase treatment options for thousands of people benefiting from it."
As the data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, are limited if it is used for more than three years, it is not recommended to use the treatment method for longer than that.
Due to the climate of political regularity, the vote in the Muslim regions was
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed last year because of corruption, resulting in a report by the government
The climate of political correction led to the close of eyes from a wide-ranging electoral community in Muslim communities, revealing the government report published today.
Sir Eric Pickles, former Minister of Government, strongly criticises the police, electoral observers and city councils for closing their eyes from the electoral court 'in view of the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion'.
As former Minister of Regional Administration and today's anti-corruption forces, Pickles said that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to set up security chains outside the voting seats so that the intimidated voters could be protected.
He proposes that the voters should present a identity certificate in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter must only indicate his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that the fingers be baptized in an infinite muscle after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Reporters should be more protected, says Sir Eric.
He calls on journalists to improve access to government documents and to decisions of informal committees and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent the electoral cluster, but to fight fraud against corruption and the economic interests and a culture that favours them more widely in local administrations," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report in East London after the vote in Tower Hamlet.
Last year, the special electoral court ordered that Mayor Lutfur Rahman, then, should be separated from his task because of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The Court held that Rahma “practically misleaded” the religious sensation of his Muslim community and manipulated his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamic opposition.
Rahman was said to use his campaign as the basis for the religious obligation of each religious Muslim to vote for him.
Of the vote, up to 300 had been questioned or misleaded in such a way that the person voted for another person.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of the wildlife from the whole country.
He expressed particular concern about the postal elections, where the high-ranked members of the Muslim community were told that he had pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Mr Eric (in the picture) made a number of proposals for cleaning the voting system, including the need for a identity certificate at the place of vote.
The report says: "There is evidence that some vulnerable ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the older members, particularly in Pakistan and Bangladesh-related communities."
"We were concerned that... the government institutions had closed their eyes on such activities due to "politically correct" susceptibility to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals for cleaning the system, including the ban on the handling of postal voting tickets from political activists, so as to prevent 'vote harvest'.
In its best report on Theresa May, more stringent inspections are also required in relation to registration in order to prevent the use of the voting rights register in immigration and benefits fraud.
Considering options where the voters would be required to present a identity certificate before voting.
Baptizing fingers in an infinite muscle after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systemic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Establishing a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Prohibiting the handling of postal voices and postal envelopes from political activists.
Police have the right to set up security chains around the polling stations.
The amendment of the law will make it easier to raise the intimidation charges under the 1983 Resolution of the People Act on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibiting photography at polling stations.
Only English will be allowed at the voting seats (except Wales).
Enhancing training in order to ensure that staff are monitored by a rule that only one person should be allowed to enter the voting cup at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticizes the London police and thinks it's "unraveling" that after the Tower Hamlet case, no criminal charges were filed.
"The Electoral Court separated Lutfur Rahman and his representative from the task of corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without any suspicion, and the criminal evidence threshold exceeded for many reasons."
He also criticises the inefficient 'racing inspections' of the departments responsible for the election lists of the city council.
"The decision of the chair last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was a wake," says Sir Eric.
"The country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all Parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and hidden electoral cult and its ban."
The Olympia bike's ambiguity with Duchess Catherine and other doubles beating at the Olympian Olympics of Rio
The Olympia fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics were boasted this week from a French bike, Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose ambiguity with the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to the discussions in the social media, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is not the only attorney fighting the champion who has the same view as a well-known person.
To honor the races of Rio and all the known faces on our screen screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic promoters whose ambiguity with Hollywood Publishers is obvious.
A hunter and a wolf: Brady Ellison, the American men's boogball team (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the duel of Duchess Catherine, who was on the wheels, many people have quoted in social media how a bowling shooter could be the double brother of the actor’s favourite Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a United States men's Boogball Team, caused a storm on Twitter after the pictures published on him, in which he reminiscently resembles the star of the Wolf of Wall Street film.
Ellison was aware of social media and admitted to hearing from childhood that he was like DiCaprio.
"I don't see the ambiguity so big, maybe with the beard and the mustaches," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
In London’s races 2012, the British long - term jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were exposed to the equivalence of Neil Harris, which is undoubtedly even more highlighted in these races.
Aliya Mustafina, the Great and Eminent Russian gymnast, has been called a double singer of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the other hand, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgia has been comparing Matthew Morrison for years from the Glee TV series.
This user says Nathan Adrian is a "atletic version" of the actor of the Inception film.
Similarly, for a long time, the tennisist Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have been postponed by both strong eyebrows and lips.
The silver medalist of Uinn, the Russian Yulia Efimova, likes actress Annalynne McCord, and not just because of her beautifully brown skin and blonde hair, while the American team Nathan Adrian is, according to his fans, a "atletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitti".
These two iron women, the football star Hope Solo (left) and the Dexter Series actor Jennifer Carpenter (no.), resemble each other from their face shapes and eyes.
Not only: this Twitter user was delighted when others saw the same vision.
This user wonders if there is a good reason for a couple's equivalence.
A twitter recently expressed his joy when “other people on the Internet agree with Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter’s equivalence.”
The American football star and the Dexter actor really resemble each other with their face shapes and eyes.
Many have also found the ambiguity of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's smiles and the winner of gold, Gabby Douglas and Anna come back!
The CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for a Chinese swimmer "dead like pigs"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhani, on the fourth place in the women's 4 x 200-metre freezing message, knocked out the CBC's viewers on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that during the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer's "decaying smells" and "dead as a pig" race.
The reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started to burst his own opinions at the end of the 4 x 200-metre free-coming final.
MacDonald, which was included in the CBC reports to bring color, was heard say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he left fast and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Ai Yanhan, a Chinese swimmer, 14 swims at the second part of the message 1:57.79, and 1.61 seconds left from Taylor Ruck, Canada, which allowed the Canadians to swim to China.
Viewers around Canada react quickly when they are shocked by the volume and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane twitted, "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese sniper died like a pig?
The idiot didn't realize he was yet on the shipment."
Ai Yanhani, who was sleeping in the final of a 4 x 200-metre freezing message for women, was described with the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter quickly fulfilled the rageous comments by Byron MacDonald, and many insisted on his dismissal.
The twitters didn't keep their words when they heard how ignorant Byron Macdonald was.
"Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC's mission, promptly regretted MacDonald's speech: "We apologize for the comment on the bathing performance.
It was a regrettable choice of words, and we regret that this was the case."
Finally, the CBC had to regret more than 90 times for people who had twitted in response to the comment.
The commentary colleague, Scott Russel, had to apologize for MacDonald.
After this, the CBC copied and glued his apologies to over 90 other twitters who complained about MacDonald’s speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We are sincerely sorry for these statements and for their access to the mission.
We quickly apologized to our viewers last night, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate, and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his apologies for sending and tried to defend his speech by saying that he did not mean it to be personal.
"I want to apologize for my comment that I gave last night after women's communications sleep," said MacDonald at the CBC Olympics.
"I took a swimmer to perform, not to a person.
It is clear, without saying, that I did not mean anything degrading with my words, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, the woman in the middle of the traded underwear shocked the customers
Customers didn't know where to look at when a woman took off in the middle of Primark to settle underwear.
He further aggravated the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off his foot and put it back on the shelf.
He continued to rotate and eventually tried four pairs of underwear in the shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone.
Primark chain shop in Folkestone Bouverie Place, where a woman tried underwear in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two children at the same time, tells me that after trying underwear, a woman who was unknown dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells me about what happened, "Men didn't believe in their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear from the shelves, took off her own stripes and underwear and put them on.
He did not unconsciously, but did it without being completely ashamed.
Everyone stared at him when he took his underwear off his foot and apparently didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it again three times before finally decided he didn’t like anything, dressed and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the eyes — and he didn't think about the person who would finally buy the underwear he had brought."
The 33-year-old Davidson in Kenttown continues: "How disgusting to think someone's taking home the underwear someone else has used and has not been washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I have realised that the trade staff was trying to remove these clothing from the sale after the woman had left – what is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underwear home and notice that someone else has come to them without washing them after that," add Davidson.
Mr Primark's informant commented: "Primark is aware of the situation in Folkestone's movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products concerned have been removed from the sale."
This is how you defend the armed attack with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this Dailymail.com video can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the master of the Krav Maga in New York, Rhon Mizrach, and we asked for advice on how to survive a gun in the nearest distance of a robbery or an assassin.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker, depending on whether the attacker is close to or behind you.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing we have to do is turn around to see the attacker and get out of the shooting line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so that it will pass between your elbow and your shoulder, and strike the attacker into your face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker with a knee into the neck, and when he goes into the pain a double, shove him on his face with a gun's peak and hold a gun on him.
The technology is equivalent if a armed attacker approaches from the front, you have to move away from the gun line, get on the gun and rotate it so that the attacker can't be triggered.
At the same time, put your weight on the weapon, and the attacker with the box in the chest. Turn the gun off the attacker, back down, and hold the gun on the attacker.
Does that sound awkward?
Look on the video how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robber is to hand over your cash — unless you are the Krav Maga master.
The world traveller Ian Wright licks the dirttest places in Europe
The British world traveller put his resistance and his scattering reflex on a hard test by licking the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The Suffolk composer and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove the strength of their resistance by licking the euro banknote, handicraft in Piccadilly Circus, rinsing the train toilet button and Russian public phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the targets on a luminometer to see and to show the viewers where the language was pushing.
Ian Wright, a documentary of the experiment, was made on track of internal power, and its results surprised.
The idea of rinsing a train toilet button can be disgusting, but in fact, more bacteria are in the kitchen's cafeteria.
On his way to Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals to strengthen good intestinal bacteria and their health.
Fortunately, nothing that he arrowed caused nothing but the mouth of a bad taste.
Ian Wright first became known for his travel program, where he tested the stamina of his intestine by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
No doubt the licking of the handholds of railway stations and the rinse of the toilet button challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says in the document: "I've been rather careless about my health since I was a kid, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth, such as soil, worms and cheeks."
In the film, he really showed himself to be his reputation.
The border came against only in the horrific general bathroom in Russia.
The luminometer measured over 4,000 units of the sample.
For the purposes of comparison, it should be reported that in anti-washed hands, the number is usually less than 60.
The border came against the Russian general toilet, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4000 units — the same figure in the anti-washed hands is less than 60.
Wright adventures with Valio in the documentary picture Ian Wright – on the tracks of internal power, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document, "This is the worst smell I've smelled in any toilet.
There's nothing dirier than that!
This place is so disgusting, I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced a documentary picture of Ian Wright – following internal power in cooperation with Valio.
From Valeo, Wright received Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the good bacterial strain and resistance of the intestine.
Niko Bergenmaa, Head of the Category of Snacks, Sappiness and New Products in Valeo, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating, and at the same time tells us the benefits of the probiotes.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and finally, we ended up asking Ia."
The health of the intestine has become a global trend.
"We wanted to bring them to a wider connection instead of just talking about products and tell them about good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
The health of the intestine has become a global trend, and the document helps us to provide consumers with more information on it in an interesting way.
The film also tells us our sense of humor!"
The film guided Tom Hakala adds to this: "Let's say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items that we have requested, such as a disgusting Russian toilet that is also shown in the movie.
Naturally, it was easier for Ian to lick some objects, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the record."
In a survey carried out by Valio in 2015, 84% of respondents included lactic acid bacteria in particular to the well-being of the abdomen and intestines, and 58% reported that they used at least occasionally products to add milk acid bacteria.
Before he disappeared, the bride family destroyed a town-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall.
The turbulence family left the damage of 50.000 pounds to the city’s rental house after they had been banned because of the terrorization of the neighbourhood.
Tanya Skeldo and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have been banned from their apartment in Cornwall, Saltash, after numerous complaints against couples.
After the couple had been forced to withdraw from the apartment, the representatives of the tenancy company found that the apartment was shocked by renovation.
The walls had apprehended openings, the floorboards had been ripped off, the garbage was spread on the floors, and the walls were strangled with graphites.
The couple has now moved, and they are believed to live in a private dwelling.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she is afraid that the apartment may not be saved.
He says: "This has been a full nightmare for people living here, no one should have to bear this kind of thing.
There is a lot to weigh, as the property is likely to be known not as such a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family's annoying, as is its name."
There were three boys in the barbecue who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the horror of the family included street wars on baseball balls, intimidation of nearby people, drug use and transmission, and loud screaming, arguing and curse.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease contract, received an insocial behaviour order.
There were old wastes found in several rooms in the house under the demolition threat.
They had sold drugs from the house before, and the floorboards had been ripped off.
According to the neighbors, the family fought on the street, and the police had to call the place regularly.
The Cornwall Home Office evicted the couple this week after giving them 11 weeks of extra time to move out on a voluntary basis.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the hurricane — they said their lives were a earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door for 20 years, and all that time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
"This morning, we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It's gonna be lovely now that they've finally gotten married."
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall housing agency, reports that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly invited to attend.
Garbage and old toys had been thrown on the wild wall of the tenant's house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a shame that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her own behaviour and for his family, because the exclusion is always the last measure that Cornwall's housing agency is considering.
This case was extremely difficult, since conduct was extreme and their actions must have been shocking for the neighbourhood.
I am grateful to my group, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the Community who took part in the work and offered us the courage to provide information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of the neighbours and send a message that non-acceptable dissocial behaviour."
Fitzpatrick tells me that the three boys in the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but they were already 20s.
The dirty matt found in one of the bedrooms after the evacuation
Housing workers now have to clean out the waste bags surrounding the house.
In 2014, the police made a raid and found more than 70 grams of cannabis and also waxes and other equipment and 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon was fined when he had been found guilty of the possession of class B rumours for the purpose of selling it.
He claimed that the money was for his dead son, Lee Skeldon's tombstone in 2013 in a car accident.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been heard of moving to a private dwelling in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were wasted with graffiti.
The police say they're insisting on expulsion for tenants who break the lease rules.
The police of Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall say this is a clear warning to the tenants who are constantly defying the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave as they want without accusations, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior," says Crow.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and associative behaviour and will continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-fly, shored army shower frightened tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane crashed at a very low level.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when the tourists were exiled when the lowly flying jet blew over the whole beach.
The dramatic images show how a military plane arrives almost in touch range from tourists taking the sun on the sandfield in Aveiro, North Portugal.
Refugees rose on their feet, making themselves understandably concerned about the steering of the jets of the jet that began to belong before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened last afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the pictures of the dramatic passing and the videos of the social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It crossed the beach twice in a really low place, and there was a moment when it looked like it was falling into the ground."
Nowo Arroja adds: "I was surfing, and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
The tourists on the shore of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly came to see and flew at a delicate low level.
The Portuguese Air Forces today reported that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, so the plane had to be so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke caused by close forest fires was detrimental to visibility, but according to the Air Force, this did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of the continental Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Forces today reported that, because of the poor visibility of the turbulent fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
The result of the first half of exotes better than expected
The Social and Health Circular of South Karelia (Exote) made EUR 3.4 million better than planned in June.
The result of the exodus was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institution care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
Exote is trying to shorten the operational line this year.
The exote covers the deficit that had been born in the past by surplus.
The overriding proportion may be used to shorten the lines and buy measures for patients.
The overall result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exote Government will discuss the half-year report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special limiters swore in Immola, a military whale
70 guardians of the border and maritime school swore a military whale on Friday.
In Immola, the military election of border and maritime guards was held on Friday.
The tenth special border ice cream course was held at the garrison sports field.
The military whale swore 70 guards.
Special border hockeys are trained for demanding border safety, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people came for a special limiter.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special border ice creams have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces during the war were involved in the event of the valley.
The middle age of those who were with them is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event have been born in 1918.
A lot of bandits ahead of the area - criminal intelligence helps to investigate crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
In each of the 11 Finnish police departments since the beginning of 2014, RTA, or criminal intelligence and analytic unit, has operated.
The unit's operation is invisible to the outside.
A total of four police officers in the ugly police department in Lahde and Hämeenlinna.
It's pulled by a sergeant placed in the Bay.
Inspector Lahti is the headmaster of the coat.
In addition, the unit’s strength includes a civilian dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone's working in a civilian suit.
The unit has demonstrated its feasibility and necessity, looking at Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit will provide different investigations to the other police.
In disgrace, it has, among other things, acquired information about asylum seekers.
Reform of the most recent working practices
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working practices.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, i.e. the fact that the police are going to less and less and less and less until they get the alarm.
The data collected and analysed by the unit will target daily police activities where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units, and their own criminal intelligence units were set up in each police station.
The PTR Centre, acting in connection with the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, is a national leader.
PTR units work according to their name by the people from the police, the Tulis and the Border Guard.
The RTA departments, in turn, work according to the police departments in distributed areas and are responsible for providing information to local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond its territory
Where the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what's going on in the whole area of the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of its own facility, as crime does so too.
Workers in the RTA Unit have better skills than basic police.
Through registers, alert databases and observations, the unit seeks to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called sermon, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own ways of acting.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
On the basis of the practice, the factor forms a particular image.
The offer can be made on the basis of either the way or the person, depending on which police officers have more information.
Criminals Learn From their Errors
The workers of the RTA unit do not go around the city, but their work is not completely public.
As far as the methods of using criminals are concerned, it cannot be reported, as it could lead to the development of professional criminals and thus attempting to prevent police crime attempts.
The police are publicly informed of the procedures if they are anticipated to cause threats.
For example, such a case was news about the labelling of empty dwellings used in housing breaks in the early summer.
In that case, the authors put the apartment on the outside door, a stick, a button needle or a tape piece, where they tried to see if the residents are really traveling.
The examination material shall be public to the parties concerned at least.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest orders the Supreme Court Protocol, which, for example, indicates that fingerprints have been found.
The next time we go to the thieves, the gloves will be handed.
For this case, Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppa has been interviewed from the Häme police, Lieutenant Tumo Lepola from the East Finland police, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärve from the Joensuu police station and Detective Arto Judgea from Central Criminal Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse data designed for practical action.
Based on a reduction in labour and funding levels.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-step reform of the PORA, which ended at the end of 2013.
Government cooperation collects information from outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
The London School Girl, who joined Daddy, died in Syria
News reports that one of the three British schools, Kadiz Sultana, who joined Isisi last year, has been killed in Syria.
Counselor Tasname Akunjee tells the girl's family that Sultana died in Syrian Raqqa a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed by Russian air strikes in Raqqa, Isisi's base in Syria, ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she was just planning to flee from the country of war and return to Britain.
"It can only be hoped that this will serve as a warning example and a will to make people realize that this is a real risk when they go to the war zone - and that makes people quit the decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015 Sultana, together with two other eastern school girls, rose into a plane flying to Turkey and continued to travel on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria and remained a widow only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's name in the Supreme Court if he's elected.
Harry Reid, the Democratic Director of the Senate, says he is convinced that Hillary Clinton, the President of the Democrats, will appoint Merrick Garland as Judge to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republicans of the Senate have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the Senate's majority director, Mitch McConnell, the next president will choose the person to fill in the seat of Antonin Scalia, Judge of the Supreme Court.
Reid said at a phone conference on Thursday that he predicts Clinton's choice of Garland's "growth with great certainty".
Reid's reporter later explained that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "run the boat" by picking someone else.
Garland is the head of the U.S. petition court in the county of Columbia.
Reid says that the Republicans who prevent Garland's appointment are presidential candidate Donald Trump's "orders" and "predecessors".
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to Treats, the naked calendars belong as well to women as to men.
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere and brings to the market the 1970s style and inspired by Pirell for 2017.
Instead of public secrecy models, they want to find the best models for the next generation in their NU Musen calendar 2017.
Earlier this year, the CEO of Treats, Steve Shaw, told me that his naked newspaper is different from the old school Playboy magazine, because he said, "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this for women."
Apparently, he feels the same way about the calendar.
"We must bring back timeless and classic nakedness, where women, even men, can enjoy and inspire these glorious pictures of women's body without trouble," says Shaw's press release on the calendar.
"Women will certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
As a model for the calendar, you can send your photos via the network or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: Who buys albums?
Single, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write a commentary on your angry objection with the name "None All Single Men of the Middle Age", this argument is based on actual research data.
According to the YouGov research company, there is no burial of the Millenium generation behind the new arrival of many talks of vinyl plates, when the millennias want to know the physical object in their hands, but instead, there is nostalgia of the middle age.
The age of the person who recently bought the vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group 18 to 24 is the least likely buyer.
Also, it is not just the desire of hobbys to hail albums, but the importance is emotionally based: older buyers of vinyl plates are more likely to hide their feelings (56% v. 53%) and enjoy solo (69% v. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog was a television news broadcast, the camera would follow me walking along the vigilante Soho Street, wearing a jewelryless gray jacket. I'd like to make my hand a cup and say something about tradition, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Even though Soho has slowly lost its charm and filthy, when hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have conquered before the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there is still a handful of special record shops left.
I'd probably ask a photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I'm very close to visiting men in these shops and try to monitor their age and nature.
Stuart of Glasgowinen, 55, followed by Sister Ray (at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) at the Reccess Records (at the moment, eight middle-aged men, one probably 20-year-old woman) are on a meeting trip to London for the afternoon and spends extra time on the supply of shops.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3000 to 4000 disks."
These albums fill in his living room wall, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me an e-mail, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly in his available income. He is now able to buy albums that he could not afford when they first appeared and to buy again things he had to sell when he was young and unpaid.
"I get a lot of things from the end of the '60s and early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that buyers of vinyl plates are more likely to be introverts that enjoy their company, and adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my bad."
Wez, 25 at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers match the YouGov profile.
However, he has found a new kind of human flow that has been affected by media jumping. These people have heard of the re-entry of vinyl plates and now feel compelled to buy their old albums back.
"On the basis of my discussions, people had generally given up their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This can explain the buum of certain ages of vinyl eruption.
What, then, about the supposed emotional meaning of sound recorders?
In just a few seconds, in a movement like Phonica, you realize that they provide comfort to the same spirits of the community.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly upset by the non-contact payment system.
The digital world may boast some of the vinyl fans, whose return to well-known disc boxes means continuity and resembles the happy days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills a hole or material property into some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I believe so many others too.
It's an easy way to get thoughts off."
"We're like social workers!" he's snooping with Wez's coworker behind the board.
The ICM study in April revealed that nearly 50% of those purchased the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
The psychological study also reported that 41% have a record player that they never use, and 7% of the buyers of the vinyl record have no own record player.
At this point, I'd probably look a serious face while I'd be backing up a stack of pussy bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl plates also involves a "pocal phenomenon" which is found by the Sounds of the Universe (at the moment three middle-aged men) seller Jonny, 42.
"The first customer recently came into circulation and said he didn't have a record player, but he wanted to buy a radiohead record so he could put it in his shelf," says Johnny.
"The proportion of such customers is not high, but they are.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients tell us they still don't have a record player.
They're younger, not parents, mostly teenagers, who are just starting their hobby."
The customer is much more varied in Fopp, where I come next, and the store has owned a whole layer of vinyl plates.
Customers have 70-year-old couples, photography tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The different kinds of customers are delighted, even though the mood is not as relaxed as in previous movements: the synthetic pop of the horny jazz instead of the horny jazz, the newest sex of Wild Beasts.
None of the clients seem very lonely, but the bleeding psychological trauma is difficult to detect by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Fopp for a few minutes and watched various discs on the discount.
He's rather watching than making shopping.
He tells me that his income is small, so collecting plates is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot.
Music is easy to listen from a computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the vineyard is ...", he lets a lovely slide and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a trade that is said to inspire a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teen-aged girls who would think they'd be jumping up with jeans, but instead, they're gathering for a moment around the Polaroid cameras, and I see a father and a daughter who think about buying a Crosley recorder.
On the left, there is a staircase filled with the wall on the disks of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of modern music and classics, central sheets in any medium collection.
No one's looking at the wall, perhaps because they're just a decoration element and a part so high that they're not even promoted.
They're pure "art vinyl."
However, given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money to the industry and send some customers to hack to Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It is not surprising that a group of people, most likely to have more time and money than most people, is also the group that spends most money on luxuries, such as vinyl plates.
Although my studies show that the results of YouGov are true, at least in Soho's recording shops, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans, which are actually in both record shops and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or work.
They certainly don't spend Thursday mornings shaking on the Berwick Street recording shops, screening albums and avoiding 30-year-old television broadcasters, staring scary and looking at unprecedented middle-age men.
Holker or ice shark is the longest living spine – video report
According to researchers, the longest living backbone on earth is the ice shark.
According to the male investigator Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was found forever in the study for 272 to 512 years, a five-metre female.
The French court rejected the application for unloading the stores in the jungle camp
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities, in which they call for the decommissioning of tens of temporary shops and restaurants by thousands of refugees in a jungle camp.
In the case of Calais this week, the authorities argued that the State should be allowed to dismantle the 72 temporary trades established for refugee camps, selling different goods from tobacco to energy drinks and providing haircuts.
According to the Prefects of Calais, these shops and restaurants need to be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and are accompanied by fire and hygiene.
Humanitarian aid groups told the Court that trades and restaurants are necessary for the camp, because free meals offered by the government and other organisations are not enough for the growing population in the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and free food for those who need them.
The Court of Justice decided that there was no legal basis for the deportation of 72 temporary traders, but that the concerns of Calais' prefect were considered "to be comprehensible".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, camp food shops, cafes and restaurants are much more important than offering food to people who are "live in extremely unstable conditions".
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under the decommissioning threat was the Jungle Book Kids Café, which is unprofitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French hours and asylum advice for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp, whose status is most vulnerable.
More than 170 000 people have signed a address where a child’s cafe is required to be kept.
According to a letter sent to Guardian, its closure would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after the sharp growth of the summer's numbers, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record of over 9 000 lives.
Food prices fall significantly faster in Finland than in the EU average
In Finland, food is drastically cheaper to the joy of consumers and to the harm of producers.
Food prices have fallen by almost 5% in Finland over three years, with an average decrease of 0.9% in EU countries.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one per cent higher.
During the last three years, food prices have declined to the secondest in Finland in those EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
From analogue countries only in Britain, food prices have declined faster than in Finland.
The information is presented in Ilkka Lehtinen, Director of Statistics Finland’s Development, published in the Info & Trends Blog.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices, which are proportionate to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices tended to be close to the price level in 1994.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then followed the turn, after which the food has become cheaper for the year.
The price is now heavy by the bans imposed by Russia on food imports, which have blocked food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
"Putinen policy has helped a Finnish consumer with a short target", says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition in industry and trade has also affected the price decrease.
The large trade chains S-group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
The consumer's price competition has been seen as a spectacular advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not the palms of affordable food, although the food price has fallen well.
In 2015, food was the fourth of Finland's most expensive EU countries with the same wage level as Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that, if the reference countries had the same percentage of VAT, food would be sold in Finland from third countries of the same wage level.
The newspaper compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the rate of VAT was seven in the veracity countries, only the Germans and the Netherlands would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the old EU countries at the cost of food, the VAT must be halved to the average level of the EU countries and continue the price competition," says Lehtinen.
The newspaper notes that the calculations made by him at the rate of VAT are guiding.
School isn't exactly the same anymore.
If you return to school seats, you may find that the school has changed during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be implemented at the beginning of the academic year in all sub-schools.
It is a guide for all Finnish schools.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of a beauty script is quitting, and instead, schools are starting to practice coding.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social learning is already read by four.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of students.
Before, it was thought that the teacher was teaching students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how people try to make school visits more interesting.
The longest backbone in the world, the ice shark can live for 400 years.
The somniosus microcephalus, known as Icehain, is only at the age of 150.
It can live 250 years after that, report a new study.
The figures make the species the longest spinal cord in the modern world.
In animal life, it only passes the Islamic Sheep, whose oldest known individual has been scheduled to be 507 years old.
The Greenland sharks are swimming along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch dogs longer, they can grow up to over five metres.
As the growth rate is slow, following observations, only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen to colleagues found out.
He defined the last 28 females of adult icefish that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbonisation of the lenses.
The average age of the investigated sharks proved to be at least 272 years.
Two major fish, 493 and 502 centimetres of amazon, were exposed to approximately 335 years of age and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have shown that ice hainarians only reach generations of more than four metres, researchers calculated that at that stage they are about 150 years old.
The research was published by Science.
Stockmann's firing to almost 300 sellers won't be reduced.
Almost 300 employees will be dismissed from Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"The result of these reforms is to reduce around 300 jobs, most of which are redundancies", says Stockmann in his communication.
It states that the number of shops sellers will not be reduced in order to avoid suffering from the customer service.
In addition, about 80 employees of support activities will be offered a new job as a vendor.
Stockmann's core negotiations concern about 3,000 employees.
At the start of these reductions, it was estimated that there were approximately 380 employees.
The reduction of the population will aim at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which will take place in the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is the difficulties of Stockmann to get profitable from the warehouse store.
Although the group’s adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11,1 million, the trade in goods still makes losses.
According to Stockmann's CEO, Lauri Veijajani, sales in freight houses have not reached the objectives set by the company.
"Personal reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive operating performance of Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijainen states in the Communication.
The second quarter’s performance improvement was particularly behind the good success of Lindex’s clothing chain.
The Ketju achieved its best turnover and results for the second quarter of all.
Lindex's operating profit increased to EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that this year's group's net sales will fall from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest northern temperature below 20 degrees in the whole country.
The low pressure center on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, reports the meteorologist Ilona Flang of HS.
In the middle parts of the country there are also rain decay, but the southernest is poutas.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as the whole country has less than 20 degrees of mercury.
The rainy areas in the north remain 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's general sports team is shaken by the doping scandal - a bizarre explanation for the trainer's pace
Kenya’s general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Olympics in Rio after it turned out that Anzrah played the country team as a sporter in the doping test.
The news agency AP told me that the athlete Anzrah attempted to appear was 800 metres of the star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya’s field team, reported that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials came to the authorities of Anzrah.
So I said Anzrah was sent home because he "have committed his crimes against Kenya's country team."
He played as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such a use," Kip Keino, Chairman of the Kenya Olympics Committee, in turn, went to the news office Reuters.
The Olympics' sports starts on Friday, and Roth is supposed to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was invested last year in the MM race on the fourth route and has a pre-existing Rio winner favourites.
According to Reuters, the source inside Kenya’s general sports team argued that Anzrah traveled with an accreditation card for an athlete only to get free meals at the race.
When the antidoping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to reveal it," said the source.
Where is everybody?
Rio's general sports stadium rubbed into its emptyness
Where is everybody?
At least not in Rio's Olympic Stadium, watching general sports.
On Friday, Rio began a struggle on the medals of general sports, but the world’s top creatures were able to present their skills to the empty viewer.
On Friday, the Rio organisers reported that only 58 percent of the first day's morning race tickets and 65 percent of the night race tickets have been sold.
The other one was four years ago in London, where the stadium pulled out of hurricane people.
The final tickets are already sold in Rio.
The disappearance of the Olympiads in Rio has attracted attention already before general sports.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the views of rugby, melona and horse riding.
When the Brazilian medal beams at Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played a beach balloon in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the view was full.
After Brazilian doubles, the Netherlands was playing against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12 000 people’s view was no longer full.
The bad business explains at least that Brazil, which struggles with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian competitors, and many of the Olympics are strange to Brazilians used to football.
Although even the first game of the Brazilian football team was not completed with the football stadium.
The publisher Mario Andrada, who was the competitor, said this weekend that 82% of tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
Andrada said, "There are still 1.1 million ends to be sold," says Reuters.
Of the 8,5 million Olympics in London, 8,2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half more than Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around EUR 9 to over 1,000 openings.
More than half of the tickets pay less than 16 euros.
In the Olympiaans of London, volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio because the organizers need money and try to get tickets to sell until the last moment.
However, the organisers in Rio have given 240 000 tickets to less-known species, such as golf and rugby.
At the Rio Stadium, there was plenty of empty seats in the morning.
Even the beach balloon in Copacaba's sand hasn't been interested in the audience.
Jukka Central Salo competed in London 2012.
We've had enough of the people with the leafs.
A New Way to Protect Nature - Get Right to Land
Helsinki Foundation participates in the conservation of the environment by new means.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant habitats.
After that, private companies and entities can redeem their rights to the country with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first territory in Lapland.
The area is virtually divided into blocks that will be able to obtain against the payment of the right of holder.
The holder shall be entitled to a veto of 187 square squares, which in practice means that no approval is required for each holder if the use of the area is to be changed.
Holding rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
The acquisition of a right of control is something concrete that can be left as a inheritance or given as a gift.
You don't have to go to bear banderols or tie yourself somewhere to protect nature," Juha Leviakans, who acquired the right of control, argues.
The person who acquires the right to control receives accurate location information from its block, which enables, for example, a visit on the block.
On the website of the Foundation, the name details of the holders' rights are found in the same map as the land block data can be found.
The spreadsheet sees that its acquisition of nature is a risk only that the activities of the Foundation change from its original idea.
Helsinki Foundation has been established as a Foundation of General Interest aimed at promoting the protection of the environment and of the natural environment.
The risk is that the Foundation would act somehow unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltia project is to protect natural habitats so that they can be intact and peaceful.
The Foundation will acquire areas either by buying or by donation.
It finances its activities mainly by selling ownership rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The aim of the Foundation is to obtain more protection countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and is planning landing from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Chamber of Commerce from 13 to 19 August.
Bird thieves torture the worst Turku of the big cities. Look at the situation in your homeland.
Motorcycle thieves torture Turku from the great cities of Finland.
This year, more wheels have been stolen in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in nine other major cities.
The Helsinki Sanomat reported to the police on the basis of bike thieves, the amount of bicycles stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year, and their parts per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose up.
According to police information, four to five bike thieves per thousand inhabitants took place.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bike thieves per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, double the number of thieves occur in proportion to the number of inhabitants compared to others," describes the police officer Tommi Reen.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have the answer.
"The publicity of the risks can be influenced by how much the city is moving on wheels and how much wheels there are," says Sergeant Teemu Muschi.
Tommi Reen, the police government, looks forward to the fact that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu are going to be at the top of the comparison.
The number of bike thieves goes largely according to the city of study and bicycles.
Turku has a close centre, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different kind of city where city centres are away from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily a primary means of movement," Reen says.
Overall in Finland, the police have been informed a little less bike thieves in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the trend of recent years, the police are aware of a little over 20 000 bike thieves each year.
It means 50-60 filters every day and only in Helsinki about 4 000 bikes per year.
"They're big amounts," says Reen.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, because only some of the victims report the thief to the police.
Reen urges people to file a criminal report on bike thief, although fewer than one tenth of the police have been informed.
Typically cleared bike thief is one where the police are informed about theft immediately and the thief is caught in blood.
"Accesses will also be found in other investigations when, for example, the drug case can find stolen wheels in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in connection with the work or police investigation, says the senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
He said that wheels are stolen, for example, from wheelchairs, indoor yards, warehouses and wheelchairs in commercial centres, which is practically everywhere where they are normally stored.
The best of individual bike models is stolen in the way of the previous years.
The U-lock gives the bike a better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves, for example, take a bike for their short-term use, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up selling, for example, via the Internet.
They stay on the domestic market.
"It has never been known to the police that stolen wheels would go much abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the wheel used must be careful because he may be guilty of a hidden offense or offense.
"The alarm bells should be called if the good bike is sold in a clear subway," Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi is always carrying his colorful Nops to protect the library of Kallio in Helsinki for his working day.
He's had five bikes, but no one's been stolen, the Beast says, "Never taken, there's been a good monk."
"Maybe this isn't so attracting the thieves, this may not have a hipster value," the Hellenic Horse wonders.
In the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, Siui Valve quickly closed his bicycle with a small u locker.
Now, the bike sniffed the wig against the wall, but usually the vigilante locks his bike into something solid, such as a wheelchair.
"There will be a lot to think about it, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says the Greek student about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about EUR 500.
"All the time you hear from your friends that the wheels have been taken."
"Because most of the bad wheels, that kind of squirrel. "
A bike was stolen from the inside of the house company a year ago.
Although the bike had been unlocked, the Guard could wait for it to be snatched.
Under the age of 15 for his crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jurys familiar with the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peers are attempting to prevent young people from becoming into a criminal cycle.
At first, the experiment is applied to persons under the age of 15 who are now out of criminal liability.
We're missing the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer jury is discussing what happened with the offender and deciding the sanction.
A week later, the offender himself can join a peer jury to make up for what he did.
Other consequences, for example, may be a letter written to the family, explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Managing Director Tommi Department tells you the model isn't tight.
We have other conciliation models that are used parallelly.
"Everything guides young people's activities in a more responsible direction so that they don't get ruined for the first mistake," says the Institute.
A model of the United States, where it is widely used, has been taken into account in the comparative lighting crew.
The idea is that a young person, after his first crime, is not going to be in front of the adult panel, but reflexed about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The Palmu Service Designer Iikka Lovio, who followed the experiment, reports that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of people under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with before.
"It's been a message to keep on the way you've chosen," says Lovio.
The comparative jury is part of the Finnish Immigration Young Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new approaches are offered to all those in need, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop financing the Trump campaign
Over 70 powerful Republicans say that they signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received it to see a draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be transferred to Congress elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump and his disrespect, incompetence and remarkable imbalances threaten to bring to these elections Democrats a sound ring," says Politico.
Only the immediate direction of all the funds to the Congress elections can prevent the Republicans from drowning the Trump decorated anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as the chances of Trump to win the presidential elections will be reduced every day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in next week.
Among the signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people organized by the letter is my republican Andrew Weinstein, who is clearly opposed to Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "humans who want to protect the party's majority in the Congress" and that it is not the support of anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump's actions that are believed to infringe millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous autonomous tendencies.
Previously this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trumps as President.
Clinton promises relief to the U.S. families of children
In the United States, Hillary Clinton, the President-in-Office of the Democrats, told me about the details of its economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to become President to make the US economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to be president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," said Clinton in his speech.
The Clinton Plan focuses on a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve US infrastructures - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part by tax increases for rich people, partly by private money.
The construction programme is hand-in-handed to the American duunas who are suffering from the transition of factories to the low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in good-paid jobs after World War II.
We're a builder. We have to get back to building!
Clinton told me.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the status of working children’s families.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, highlighting that rich people should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to be tax-free, it's gonna have to pay for the tax on departure, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"I, as President, oppose all trade agreements that work against employees or wages," said Clinton.
According to the speculations published in The Washington Post before Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticise the economic programme published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday that it " recommends only millionaires such as this".
The discount proposed by Trump on corporate tax Clinton has previously been appointed "Trumpin pork".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and the clothes that Trump himself manufactured in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton spiked.
These are Rio's viewers: The races have not tied Finns to the squares, but the mobile app is interested
Normally, sports races are seen as the sharpest mountain tips in television viewers’ statistics.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not been reaching out to the cheeks of viewers.
At one time, 12 per cent of the population have been attached to the squares at best: on Tuesday night, the swim was followed by 615 000 people from the Yle Olympic Channel2 at the same time.
As a result of comparison: the month-on-month general sports games at the TV2 received almost 800 000 audiences at a time, and the EM Games in football were fairly second million.
To date, the Olympics have been most interested in cycling on Sunday night and the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million people at the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, Head of Sports, is pleased with the audiences, and reminds us that the viewers are distributed in the Olympics of Rio for the first time in several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns are following the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much of the TV viewers will choose the Olympics in general.
The TV viewers also share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports contests Yle has owned a whole channel.
When the shipment arrives 24 hours a day, and there are viewers from 20 000 to 50,000, it is a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in London’s 2012 or in Beijing’s 2008 races, but the difference is explained by the difference in time difference - a large part of Rio’s competitions becomes in Finland at nighttime.
Another reason for the distraught interest - if someone thinks it now - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken the initial races of someone's surprise medal, the interest would have bumped up with it.
In addition, general sports are about to start, as is the case with other Finnish interesting species: sailing and riding.
At first, according to Pokkise, the number of viewers has been close to what was expected.
When the general sports starts, the audience will explode.
The Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the races, which rose on the first days of the races in Apple's App Store for Finland's most downloaded free application.
By Monday, the application was loaded 150 000 times.
I'm guessing we're already going on 200 000 downloads.
"We'll only get the blood viewer numbers later," Pokkinen says
Rio Arena has not acted with all users in the desired way.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the mistakes have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by delays and other small technical problems at the beginning.
Applications have provided updated versions that should correct errors.
The Olympiads of Rio are more visible on Yle’s channels and arena than any other sports event ever before.
From Yle Fem, you can follow some species, and on the radio, Yle Speaking carries games every day.
The Olympics are not only the hardest worker to Yle ever, but the last ones that can only be followed from Yle’s channels.
From 2018 onwards, the Olympic Sports will be displayed both in Yle and in commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Day, with a depth of 95.3 metres on the cross.
It could be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technician instructor, found a weight of about 20 square metres on the cross, the bottom of which the diving computer showed 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre was in vain to confirm the observation by digging.
The method may not be found in a small depth of 100 metres, says the development engineer Jari Hakala.
So now the official depth remains 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are the Inari lake (92 metres) and Suvaswater (90 metres).
Saima, Toisvesi and the Main Lake reach over 80 metres.
They have not been investigated as closely as Päääääääääät.
Especially the bottom of the Inari Lake has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths in it," Kannila is wondering.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Juka Lake, 23 metres.
In this way, your Day cannot reach the ten deepest, and the summer water is still far from the top.
Correction on August 12, 14.29: The last copy corrected in which the deepest lakes of the middle depth were wrong.
Fascinating Tax: The tax on pensioners is still tighter
The tax on pensioners is still tighter than those for employees.
The lover says that the misconduct was raised under the parliamentary elections, and that the tax on pensioners was promised to be equal to those who have paid.
This is not the case in the government's presentation.
We believe that it should definitely be there.
After the elections, the promises made should be maintained, he says to the Media of the West.
At the beginning of this year, employees received income reductions which reduced taxation.
In the parliament, the issue was raised by the opposition's representatives, who swept the Minister of Finance, Alexander Stubb (Kok.) on election promises.
Buying power is secure, it won't grow.
In the line presented by Minister of Finance, Petter Orpo (Kok.), the tax reductions are, according to the Ihaean, mainly about protecting and not increasing purchasing power, since the wages will not be increased next year.
He says that tax reductions have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
The lover is pleased with the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Orpo's desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been concluded in a difficult time.
He says that it is important for credibility to adhere to the agreement.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done with the strength of the social partners, so it must not be put into question.
This will be needed because the economy is so much in the reserve of domestic demand and people's own future beliefs.
Long-term unemployment in offense
The lover appeals to the government to deal with long-term unemployment in a budget line, at least to stop growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed persons was about 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if the growth does not stop, the government's objective of raising the employment rate to 72% is to run away.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, the permit will have a very large social fall.
Ambassador: In the attacks in Thailand, there is no known Finnish victims
At least four people died last night in Thailand and last night in the bombings of Finland's time.
The embassy calls for Finnish observers in the country to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
It is not necessary to cancel their trip to Thailand because of explosions, but the embassy’s instructions should be followed with caution, says Westphalen.
Very little Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thai travel season is due to the yearly exchange.
Most of the Thai tourists will be from South Europe and China at this time of the year.
The Finnish embassy has received some comments from the Finnish embassy in Thailand through Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has tried to pursue the Finnish people, especially Hua Hin, in order to obtain information on the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts at Hua Hin are out of town right now.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the factor
According to Westphalen, there's not yet any information on whoever killed the attacks.
The Ambassador believes that events may be linked to the political disruption of the divided society in Thailand and to the last week referendum on the Constitution of the Military junta.
The Act was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who declared they were against the law.
In the southern regions of Thailand, the ethnic conflict associated with the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
The Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, previous attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local celebration day in Bangkok, says Westphalen.
He says that the Queen's birthday and her mother's day are celebrated in the city.
Transport in the city is very small.
The impacts have an impact on the day's time to ensure that the authorities are very precise in terms of safety.
Thailand Police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism is also closed, says the Thai Police News Office AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand in 24 hours when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the popular tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In the Finnish tourist destination, the holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs in the night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to the current data, they did not require death.
Two bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the magazine.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the magazine.
According to the local authorities, in the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, four bombs have been exploded yesterday and today.
At least one of both double bombs died.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than in South Thailand and in the city of Trang.
At least one person died in each of these attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists because it is transported to Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
Not known whoever hit the attacks
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the military junta ruling Thailand, the attacker is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusing.
We don't have to panic people any more, he told the reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, Vice-President for Security, at least Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He said to Thai BSB that the authors have been aimed at destroying the country's tourism because all the attacks have occurred in tourist destinations.
The Finnish embassy calls on Finnish people to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finns of Thailand aren't supposed to cancel their trip because of explosions, but it's worth not taking care of instructions from a large-scale one, says Westphalen.
In vulnerable Europeans
The attacks and victims of Finland during the night are known to date very little.
Last night's attack at Hua Hin has been a little more information.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians among the wounded.
At least three people were wounded in the last hit of Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded in the nearest clock tower known as sightseeing.
The Thai PBS tells me that the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin, from which it believes it has found another bomb.
According to the governor of the county, the Surat Than bomb was hidden in the flower cap.
A municipal worker died in a hit.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack that exploded every half an hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The United States Party won the women's quadruple
The United States Alexandra Raisman was second point 60.098 and the Russian Alija Mustafina third by 58.665 points.
Partys, 18, she's still looking for a tennis championship in Rio's races on a permanent, jumping, and a barbecue.
Biles has been controlling women's gymnastics in mind for the past few years.
He's got eight personal world championships for three Edules.
Fourth and permanto championships he has won three times in a row, and in the last and the next year of the tree.
In the U.S. team, Biles, two team competitions have reached the world championship.
Biles has the narrower MM militates from the woods and jump and the woods.
Asian Finnish entrepreneur: "Ishman has no influence on tourism"
Esa Huovila, a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club in the same property, has not been concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not believe that this will result in anything more amazing, it is estimated that Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur, worked for about 20 years in Asia.
A experienced entrepreneur has seen a lot of tragedy in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First, it was a tsunami, then avian influenza, and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
Even if these former tourists have not exiled the tourists, I doubt this.
The office of the Huovila company is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
At about nine, the worker called local hours and said that you shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local workers came to work in the usual way this morning.
They thought the roadblocks were set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many people haven't even heard of the attacks on the beach.
At 6: 30 p.m., Thailand’s time on Patong was normalized and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
According to the scene, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila at the scene of the attack.
Later, this car was seen in Kruunuve with Jouxholmine.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
The patrol discovered two men suitable for the emblems, hiding in a close six.
The other man was arrested immediately.
The other one escaped, but later the man was found in the woods by means of a police dog.
Men are suspected of stealing, stealing and serious damage to motor vehicles.
The police thank you for giving the tips.
Research Director on Russian Directorial Changes: Clear side transfer
On Friday, the highest leadership change took place in Russia for years when President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov, the head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Geneno.
He's an ex-diploma and he's been Ivanov's second man.
Kangasporo says that the reason for the separation of Ivanov could be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one of the ways in which power is used.
This is a way of preventing people from spreading independent power to themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been intimidated with or screwed up with other leaders.
Invasion in Ivanoville
Ivanov, a member of the Putin's interior, is moving to specific functions in environmental and transport matters.
With the state media on the tape Putin said the change to a common decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed persecution in place, said Russia Today.
Kangasporo says that from the point of view of Ivanov, this is a clear fall in position.
Environment and transport are not very high in Russia in order of priority.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russia.
Ivanov has also played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangasporo points out that the old map, such as the governors, has recently been exchanged in Russia.
The older researcher, Katri Pynnoniemi, from the Foreign Policy Institute, says that more interesting than the heir of Ivanov’s place is to turn Putin into a younger neighborhood.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when they retreated in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the city of Jarabulus so we could not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurdishists received about 90 percent of the important city of Manbij to Isisi last week.
However, it is estimated that there were tens of jihadists left in the city.
Corrected from the previous news at 19:30: We used to say wrongly that civilians were fleeing the city, and Isis fighters actually kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of Interior documentary publication line is illegal
The Ministry of Interior's guidance on public access to documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law, Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutian tells the STT that the documentary publication cannot be based on the Authority’s own policies but is based on the law.
The Ministry of Interior previously refused to issue a list of participants from the Minister of Interior's visits to the evening-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision by a letter of the Council of State and by the fact that the information was entered in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministerial Communication Manager says to the STT that the Ministry has noted the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympia show begins in Rio
Like the last few years, Bolt's been running against time under high-value races.
He was insulted from his early age and had to skip the Japanese Olympics.
This has not been the perfect preparation, but I'm much better.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low - costume dancers and fans.
Porina Bolt is surrounded by the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in a period of general sports struggled with doping scandals and luxurious interest.
Bolt’s previous loss in the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he deported at the beginning of 200 metres in 21,05.
At that time, the 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that was slowed down by your injuries and loose exercise.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres to crush the world record and the final celebration of the competitors in 9,69.
It's harder.
A year later, at the Berlin MM race, Bolt reached his career at the time of the billboard clock.
The world record in Berlin is still valid for 9,58 hundred metres and 19,19 two hundred.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is seeking a world record of 200 metres and a 19-second underrun, but no one believes that it is born but Bolt himself.
The 100 Bolt challenger is Justin Gatlin, the Olympiad winner of 2004 in Athens.
Last year at the Beijing MM final, Bolt defeated the American with only one hundredth seconds.
Bolt has not lost in the final of the prize races during his reign in Beijing once if only he has made his journey.
In Daegu, 2011, a hundred MM finals remained unrunned from Bolt because of the wildlife.
Bolt will fill up a lot in 30 weeks.
He's an old man in the species of young men, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
The last goal of your career, Bolt has set up next year's MM contests in London.
These are the Olympics who'll separate me from the rest.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm underground, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago at the Sports Illustrated interview.
Exposures from Rio: two sportsmen are suspected of doping tricks
According to the Chinese National News Office of Xinhua, Chen Xinyi, 18 Chinese supremacy has given a positive doping sample in the Olympics of Rio.
The Chinese smuggler Chen Xiny's doping sample found traces of the substances that were banned.
Bulgarian beverages Silvia Danekova are also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenyan general sports coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the sportsman.
Silvia Danenova has given a doping sample with signs of epoh hormone.
He was in the fourth place in Rio in a 100-foot butterfly of women.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estado, the Chinese supreme drug has taken its doping case to the CAS of the International Petitions Court of Sports.
Xinhua tells me that a sample given by Xiny on Sunday would have been found as evidence of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There are also other doping suspects in Rio.
BBC news that Bulgarian female drinks Silvia Danenova has given a doping sample with signs of epophormone.
Kenia has, in turn, sent a general sports coach home from Rio for a doping trick.
On Thursday, the International Olympics Committee reported that the Kenya Coach had become an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, it's Kenya's high-speed trainer John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich race pass in the situation.
Phelps can't be stopped by any historical gold came into display style
The most successful athlete in the Olympic history, Michael Phelps, U.S.A., swimming in 200 metres of his 22th Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic Golds.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer in the four consecutive races of the same species’ Olympic gold.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was located in confusion before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun, Helen Skelton, the BBC Olympiad commentator, laughs at the midnight magazine's quick interview.
The case of Helen Skelton (October) on Monday is on the website of the evening magazine, which is most read this week.
Next to you, commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton isn't much stress if the somé or the British press has a little trouble with his revealing and special costumes.
The television is visual media, he's emphasising.
Skelton has been dressed with high-level shoes and short-cream dress, which certainly has at least enough openness - at least for many conservative British boys.
However, there are no back-stages.
It's important to look good, and little judges are just a fun thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to squeeze you, and maybe it's a bit of a shock, but he stresses that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here watching sports, and the focus has to be at the sports.
It shouldn't be so important how I dress.
Can you imagine that the hood has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that pays attention to how much these swimmers do their work and how big sacrifices they make is for me, Skelton's refreshing.
You know what?
It's ugly out of nowhere if it comes from dressing (the drinker).
I'm having a little fun if one of these hit someone's radar.

The Argentine lady dressed Betrayer-Siren, the Finnish woman thought about protests
The wind of the Beaster-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Beaster-Siren experienced hard on Thursday.
The Argentine lady dressed Tuuli Peijer-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surfing day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent confessed to the failure.
He got stuck because of the accident, and others ran away, told Joakim Wilenius, Finland's main coach.
A sportsman thought about protesting for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing so because it would have been for nothing according to the Olympics rules.
I should have dropped in the water so I could have gotten a refund, the Beaster-Siren said.
The Finnish guy hanged on his desk until the last time, because he didn't want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
With the crash, the Finn remained in position 27.
In the overall situation, the 2012 Olympic Hopi Heading in London is the eighth.
With respect to the berries, the crash didn't seem to have much effect.
Friday is a big day when we're going to race 10-12.
Modified 0.39: By way of derogation from the first information, Petaja-Siren did not protest.
7 Special issues that, according to science, prolong the age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring a person more years to life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life will last.
Sometimes things that a person cannot influence can bring him more years.
These include, inter alia, tendency to mean body fat or social status.
Regular shopping may extend your age.
You don't always have to break it, just picking up a milk can.
The secret of the long age has been sought to find out by many different studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee beverages have been shown to protect from river cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’ s and Parkinson’ s disease.
The Harvard University study concluded that a moderate coffee consumption is linked to "a reduced death risk", especially with regard to neurological or heart-related diseases.
In the name of alcohol again, studies that suggest a reasonable use of one to three daily doses may extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental wire can extend the life of a person by even more than six years, one study reports.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation.
However, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway revealed how laughing affected the life of a person.
Over 54,000 people were monitored by the seven-year project.
Those who laughed more were more insulted by 35 percent more likely to live after the experiment.
Sex, when protection against sexual diseases is taken into account, has been found to be good for health.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, it is not enough just to have sex as it is.
In order to get more years of life, a person should also have an orgasm.
Mobility will certainly bring more years, and it will not be contested.
However, the achievement of a long age does not require absolute soccer.
One study at Oxford University found that women with large backs had lower levels of cholesterol.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
It was either an athlete or an actor who won Oscar, who was more likely to live longer than a regular bully.
Many studies have tried to find a reason for this phenomena.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life to the next years.
Some scientists think that the long age is due to the social status of a person, which, for example, will make it possible to pursue recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour of people over 65 years of age found that a daily shopping person, which is likely to be a lesser buyer.
This is due to the fact that running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may premature death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
A lost-humoured ride-on-way truck
On Friday night, a serious truck truck and a passenger car accident occurred in Koske, Varsinais-Suomen.
The accident occurred in Kosske, in the middle of Koskents and the Sorvastons on Friday at 9:00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa when the passenger car came to the same track, hit the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck got on its backside, but it got burned.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
A passenger car slipped into a stream and then across the door to the roof.
A woman who carried a passenger car, born in 1972, remained pressed in her car.
The rescue facility removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the University Hospital in Turku.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 promilles.
He's suspected of a horror drunk.
The mail sent to the wrong city.
Salon K-Citymarket’s bulk sausage selection was deficient because the mail had accidentally delivered a part of the load to the Wall River.
On Thursday, Teija Halt, who lives in Pernie, was buying sausages from Salon K-City Market when a funny sign hit the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the crucibles because the Posti delivered our load to the Wall River!
We'll get more when Post gets the load delivered!
So if it doesn't burst in the lawn candy, it read on the sign.
The veiling sign of the trader relates to the fact that Posti extended its services last spring to grass cutting.
The grass will be available for Post until the end of August.
In Haltia’s view, the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it in the social media.
Well, it's the best thing to do with the upgrade.
Media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention that this is raised is incredible, and Halt is wondering.
On Friday night, Haltia had more than 700 divisions on Facebook.
He got his own favorites grabbed in a sausage bag, even though some of the lairs were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesja, responsible for the business of the company transport services, regretted the damage to the evening-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages were diverted to the wrong place yesterday (the Wall River) and no longer left to do part delivery (Saloon) by three, but we only took five stages today, and Kaidesa told Ilta-Sanom.
It was the first news in the afternoon.
Teija Halt wasn't upset about the sign because he found all of his own lovers in the selection.

Wish of the family of a woman murdered in Lovisia: Recognition of the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Lovisia hopes that the victim would be remembered by donation for police dog work instead of flowers and adresses.
Sipoon's veterinarian station has published a Facebook update where it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as an alternate at the Sipoon Veterinary Station and had also completed his nurse’s training there.
The veterinarian station remembers a woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, sense of humor, and unforgivable work.
Good friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
Facebook updates include an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donation funds go to police dogs, primarily to the purchase of safe vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovisian woman was murdered in her own home in Lovisa Koskenkyla.
The woman's neighbors have said to the evening magazine that the victim was very animal-friendly.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and cocks.
A 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder knew the woman and had no connection.
The murderer was tracked by a police dog, Börje, who was wounded alive in a arrest situation.
But the beer survived, and he's recovering.
The Court of Justice issued a judgment to Post on infringement of the Equality Act
The post did not have the right to arrest the wage of a worker who refused to train the tenant, which was assessed in the judgment of Kanta-Hämee.
The right to pay Post most of the salary arrested to the employee and EUR 2 000 in the form of a compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only a part of the investigator's salary, which corresponded to the share of the knowledge of all day's work.
According to the law of the Municipality, the worker had been put in a more favourable position on the basis of his trade union activities in breach of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the PAU organisation decision of the Postal and Logistics Union on the ban on learning.
During November last year, PAU made a decision that post workers would not be familiar with those who violate the strike.
It was first reported by the People's News.
Returning Turkey to a path that respects human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and respecting human rights, writing Prime Minister Juha Sipila (centric) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
The Journalist Alliance earlier asked Sipilla and Soin to express their concerns for freedom of expression and of the press.
Sipil and Soini say repeatedly that Finland has brought Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and of speech.
Putin fired the head of his administration... as an official persecution.
President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, the head of the presidential regime, Sergei Ivanov, reports.
We'll be in the place of the Soviet-Viron Communist Director Karl Nano's grandson Anton Nano.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, reports by Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, who belongs to a close interior of Putin, is moving to the Kremlin bulletin for specific functions in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed persecution in place, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked together with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB spying.
Many viewed Ivanov as possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed as President before Putin re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition for a ban on the game... can't be seen in Valoliiga's opening.
The world recorder of football transfers can't be seen in the field when the British Valeoliga kicks in the weekend.
Paul Pogba's game ban followed up with him in England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition Paul Pogba is on the side of ManU opening his league on Sunday against Bournemouth due to a gambling ban, reported by BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million from Pogba to the Italian Society Juvent.
However, the English Football Association FA keeps him out of the game because Pogbale was under the pressure of Juventure.
He received two warnings last season at the Italian cup, and it becomes a single game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told BBC.
Pogba's next step to play is in the second league on 19 August when ManU meets Southampton.
Flow's greatness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the position of Flow Festival as an internationally renowned event of world top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
It's typical that the festivals have expressed themselves with their self-preservative dressing.
One of the main stage artists is this year the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is paved with artificial grass and artistic installations, among other things.
We have never had enough to have just a headboard and a beer, says Thomas Kallio, the artistic leader of the event.
Flow Festival in Summer Bay in Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block to tens of thousands of visitors.
There is a simple question behind success: what kind of event would the authors want to go?
It is quite different in the productions of events to think this way.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was coming to the end this year.
The aim has been to raise the number of visitors from 70 000 last year with 5 000 people.
The Festivals will also be seen this year by a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because it must be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a cattle that is being guided in the vast roads.
That's not what we want.
In 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been embedded with 130 performers, artistic instalments and numerous restaurants and drink bars in the part of the artificial grass area.
In addition to the main platform and smaller stages, 15 000 people tents will be used this year as an event site.
Kallio admits that the event could be made more simple.
Maybe I'm a little crazy, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If it disappears, this isn't our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even the great visions today are practically possible.
In the early 21st century, activities were very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for some EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow amounted to around EUR 6 million.
It can produce "green things" like building a tent of 73 metres wide.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own dressing.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been knownly profiled to be particularly fashioned.
We want to break up first and foremost with content.
Yet, fashion events also fit Flow’s value world: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the legend of the Pink, Iggy Pop 69.
A man has a huge group of fans in his genera, but he doesn't have indigenous music, pop music, rap and soul in combination festivals that are the most typical performers.
According to Kallio, Iggy was busted because it is probably the last time we see this at a show in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
Not just what the commercial radio calls.
Iggy's latest record is damn good and he's done damn good jobs in recent years.
The Thai tourist parade bombs were hidden in the flower bags, and the tourists fled in fear.
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded from the local time on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 injured.
Apparently, the bombs were hidden in a flower bag and blown up with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were blown at the same time as the tourists started to leave the bars and return to their hotels, said the police representative Samoer Yosumran CNN.
Since 1989, the wildlife protector Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, was a lot of talking about your attacks.
If the TV isn't properly seen, you can look at it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The crowd ran against me and said that the bomb has exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bars, told the Swedish Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning local time exploded two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Shortly after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket by favouring the Finns.
No one knows is dead.
At the same time, there was another double bomb attack in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that hadn't had yet to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel forces behind the bombing, who are not satisfied with the operations of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that this may also be the case of criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been intimidated by criminal organizations involving trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new ready team will begin to fight first in a war situation
In the acute war situation, backups are only ordered to take battle missions after several months of the vow of the military oath, says the Central Finnish.
According to Brigade General Jukka Sonnisen, the Head of Education of the Defence Forces interviewed by the Press, for example, of the backup men serving 5.5 months in the war situation, are only those who are in the final stage of their education.
According to the head of education, the service is first assigned to the reservoirs of the emergency forces.
No backup or reserver is ordered to perform a task that has not been trained as required, Sonnien says.
In the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces began to train backups in immediate readiness units from next year.
Units may be used in military operations if necessary already during backup training.
Pamela Tola got huge compensation from the home house.
The actor Pamela Tola and his ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a rough fight in the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The retail price of the two-fold separate house had been EUR 330 000.
After trade, however, there was a serious moisture problem in the house, causing a risky microbial growth for health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in decommissioning in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so the economic losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple brought it to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both court and court court.
The court of court sentenced the case on Wednesday.
It maintained the judgment of the Court of First Instance ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the costs of the couple's proceedings and investigations totalled EUR 47 344.
The right to a reasonable reduction in prices was slightly due to the fact that the buyers had already been aware of the need to repair the apartment.
However, according to the court law, the errors revealed were substantially more serious than had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola, in court, told me that the couple had specifically searched for a good home because they did not want to take repairs.
He had the idea that the building was basicly renovated and in good condition and that the aspects mentioned in the fitness check report would not be harmed.
The fitness check report mentioned as risks and deficiencies in ventilation and the lack of adequate management of drained rain and melting water.
However, the discussions did not show that this was a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma realized that the rainwater from the rock should be slightly controlled in a few years.
The goods were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the moisture problems of the apartment were much more serious than they thought.
Checks carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth, according to the Witnesses, due to both the rainwater of the rock and the capillary rising soil.
On the west side, the air contaminated by microbials was estimated by the inspector that it could also enter internal spaces through the porch.
A health riskable, cross-limited moisture or shark was found in cottages in the home house, in the basement stairwell, in the living room's window and in the basement washing room.
The therapists were built without permission
The court also argued whether the apartment was in breach of the construction permit.
The Court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that anti-authorisation had been made.
Among other things, terraces were built, although there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, home problems were a central issue in the court of law.
According to the court, the buyers could, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for measuring repairs in the near future.
Tola and Warom felt that there was no specific reason for the court to carry out a more extensive inspection.
The buyers have not failed their accountability, the court of court states in their judgment.
A terrible archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for Nazis in the register also for Finns.
In his recent Dagens Nyheter article, editor Christopher Andersson writes how the National Archive in Maryland, the United States, has documents stored for microfilms about a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finns, and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi Morsiam.
Documents and registration cards come from the Nazi-Deutsch Racial Agency.
The racial agency was under the authority of the SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been investigated by a SS doctor.
The same was true for even more women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynaecological studies were carried out in women to investigate it.
The racial agency examined the background of women, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's genealogy.
The women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Racial Agency handwritten life stories and good recommendations from the closest.
The racial agency wanted guarantees that women were "love children", "regulated," and "good national socialists", who knew very well German.
Women who failed to meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of SS men.
The case does not tell us what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the records of the archive.
The SS leaders created a programme supported by the State, known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme stipulated, inter alia, that each SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
The Lebensborn homes care for children born outside the marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, the pages of the US Holocaust Museum are reported.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged getting married by providing loans and supporting children.
A German mother’s court of honor was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the "Aryans" and non-Aryans were legally banned, and found on the sides of the museum.
Betrayer-Siren's sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Narkko was the third place in the first sailing of the Finnjolli day at the Rio Olympic Games, but the whole group remained at the second tail of the day.
Narkko rose in the overall situation after the eighth five departure, but the failure of the second departure dropped him in position 14.
Wind Beaster-Siren fought at the RS:X-class day leaving locations 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Betrayer-Siren is the sixth.
In the 470th class, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren remained at the beginning of the day 23.
The overall situation of Lindgrens is 19.
Jari Sillanpään Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours of sleep, "I was so stubborn."
Jari Sillanpää has been part of Finnish favorite artists for more than 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the tango king of 1995, the best sold solo artist in Finland, and the star of the dancing ships and festivals, Sillanö continues to pork and is at the moment viciously rising.
Mari Koplisen wrote a book about the life of the favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells of his life and career as well as in evil.
The career of the bridge head rose to a total rising cliff when he won the crown of the Tango King on the wall of the river Tango in 1995.
At the race, Sillanmama sang tanks, but she had already designed a little different music for herself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had written a tango piece to Sillanpää, at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinn song became one of the most popular pieces in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: the bridge head sang it on the tape in a terrible caterpillar and only a few hours after night dreams.
We had a party tonight.
I was so stubborn!
The bridge head remembers in the book.
You wouldn't expect it to be singing in a caterpillar immediately.
Although I wasn't physically on my best, the track was still good.
I learned that all the time there is no need to demand perfection and excellence.
A second incident related to the most popular pieces of man, mentioned in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner at that time and finally ended up in the texts of the Gold copy you deserve, which was published single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs that Sarah ordered from Cramp were not the same as Sillanpää would have wanted.
The bridge head had imagined making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song of the divorce were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the seven days magazine.
In the news of the newspaper, the reason for the difference between Jar and the ex-loving was Jar's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jar said that it was a full bunny, and it was not true.
According to the book, Jari made a call to the record company and refused to sing a song, but eventually, he ended up singing it, and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
At the end, 52% of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, although the opinion surveys of the voting week anticipate the opposite outcome.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in favour of staying in the EU.
None of the well-respected research institutes or university indicated the difference, although a couple of individual researchers may have disagreed with the mainstream of their professions.
The basic mantra of Western Policy, the former President of the United States, Bill Clinton, was the subjection "It's the Economy, the stupids" in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices weren't heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important issue of politics.
Economic Slinger
Centre for Macroeconomics in his latest monthly survey, from professionals to Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not heard because this time the voters made a decision on non-financial grounds.
One explanation by economists about the loss of the economic position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employed, which is almost constant.
If the immigrant gets a job, it's off the right British.
Many also have the idea that a depreciation of the currency would be a good thing, as it contributes to the export industry.
In the opinion of the economists, the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the unanimity of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, the equilibrium of the BBC gave them equal space to only a few per cent of the economists that support the EU gap as well as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hateful press was not interested in explaining what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE feels about the consequences of the difference.
These far-reaching book combinations spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the economist messages were listened and understood, they were not cared because economists represent an elite with which the voters in their opinion do not have common interests.
Academics like economists would have remained in the EU, but the message was not effective in small cities and rural areas.
Immigration is an economy.
The overwhelming triumph argument of the Brexit vote concerns immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will burst your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked out.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In each health centre's waiting room, you see immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical appointments if they weren't?
There are children of immigrants in each school.
How much easier would the real British children get a school place if they were to get rid of?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more space would the primitives have if they left?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond, and if they succeeded, their answers were not visible.
Economists have failed to explain that the British people have more jobs, less health centres and more money for education and social security thanks to immigrants.
Immigrants - and in particular EU immigrants - are net contributors of the UK government and their spending generates jobs.

One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are the responsibility of the Finnish Pertti Oldman.
He said that in Aberdeen, there was an early preparation for Brexit with plans A and B.
The plan B, which is the EU-segregating camp's victory, started to be prepared for more details a few weeks before the vote in case the result was over.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large amounts of liquid assets, but they could now be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on 23th, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, the old man says about the only open day in Aberdeen's nodebook fund that was covered by the news.
The old man said the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
The value of the Fund at that time was 3.5 billion pounds.
The total value of the company's funds is about 20 billion pounds.
It was the highest in nine open real estate funds, the Old One says about all real estate funds open to British real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at 10% or even below it.
Therefore, the real estate funds reserved for Brexit a wide range of strategies.
Funds closed trade
When a camp that supported the EU difference won, Europe was confused.
However, the few two weeks after the vote on the real estate market were quite calm, says Oldman.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney, the President of the Bank of England, who estimates that Brext could be at a high risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen his trade.
These together robbed the situation and brought it up to the main sections of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says the Old One.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and after each other, the fund had to close its door.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they didn't actually shut down the trade, they changed their pricing downwards.
In practice, the investors were given time to consider whether it would be worth taking the money out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you didn't have to take your money out now, it wouldn't be worth it, because it would cost you a loss.
It calmed the situation down, and most of them canceled the announcement.
Since then, it was quite even, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, the old one says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such decay in the Continental Europe Funds of Aberdeen.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
The old man felt that the closure of the real estate funds trade was disproportionately high.
The open funds for closures are controlled by about four per cent of the UK real estate.
Aberdeen’s closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its fund to the end of 2017.
At present, there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been downwards, but the situation does not look more "in the face of Aberdeen".
The main issues are now about the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought some of the real estate investors even new opportunities, the Old One points out.
The rate of the red and dollar is at the lowest for 30 years, and the market also has a 15% reduction compared to the time before the Brext vote.
The dollar looter can now buy the same property up to 30 per cent cheaper.
There's a lot of willing buyers, old man says.
Brexit brought mines to the London real estate market.
At 2:00 a.m., the situation didn't look so much.
But at 4:00 p.m., when Pertti, responsible for the real estate investment of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word of power.
I realized this is going to Plan B's side, old man says in his second home in Helsinki.
He was headed to work right away.
London City was already alive, despite the morning night.
The TV screens normally provided for silent at the office attracted the news, and usually the loud people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera to tell us about his divorce.
When the market opened, the evidence was flashing out of red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you'd live, old man says.
Not because, despite the wreckage, Aberdee, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, completed two real estate trades on the day following the Brext vote.
The mood was messed up.
However, the company had been well prepared for an alternative, and that is why the situation was kind of calm, says the Old One.
The Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership switched.
The market started to anticipate severe landings for the UK and London real estate market, in particular.
In London office facilities, up to 20% mines were anticipated in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze one after another.
Butdeen did that for six days too.
Now the turbulent has been depleted, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not see the last summer holidays on the face of Vanhaske in Helsinki this week.
He still thinks it is too early to say much about what Brexit follows.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been first-rated.
CBRE’s information on price developments covers about a third of the market.
According to them, prices for all real estates in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, the negative increased by 6.1 per cent, and the old one reads.
The figures aren't so bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months has been worse, says the Old One.
All equally large drops were hit in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, too, because Brexit was quickly compared with Lehman's fall and the global economic crisis that started on the US real estate market.
The old man believes that the parable is not quite right, because it is now the domestic crisis in Britain.
There's another mood, too.
The real estate market has now not seen a panic sales like that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Old Man.
There's a lot of funding that can be found normally.
In any case, the repair could have been in progress.
In fact, the price repair movement is not a miracle for him... that could have been the case without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, the prices of real estate in London and other world capitals have been too high for years.
For two years, we've been saying that the city and, in particular, the offices are overrated, says the Old One.
So the fall started very high.
London's prices have been upwards for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, and London’s population is also growing.
Another major trend is that real estates are the last ownership class that globalizes, says the Old One.
New players have been marketed in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for property investment sites abroad.
London is a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been increased by a low rate of interest, for example, where pension companies have been forced to seek income from new destinations.
In addition to this, the loan has been readily available, although, according to Vanhaske, the debt bump has now been used clearly less than during the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, disperse
In London, price increases ranked last summer, old man tells me.
Also Aberdeen started to reduce its ownership in London, and last year he was a net salesman.
There was some kind of turn to be expected, and now it came.
What do you want from now on?
It depends on how the British economy is evolving, says the Old One.
He's afraid he can't figure out what's going on, but he says there's hardly a promise to get up.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or even course ahead.
The old man has already seen more movements up and down as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And still he's a optimist who believes we can survive the hole by working.
If you are well prepared for risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, it's too much of a victim.
If it's dispersed, the risks are also decentralised, old man says.
The S group begins to register purchase information more closely than before
Soon the S Group knows what you are eating, because today the trading group has announced that it would start to collect more accurate information about the purchases of its main customers.
As far as data have been collected from the balance of the receipt, the group begins to grip on the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S group here comes after Kesko because the information on the goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to the CEO of K-Plus Oy, Ismo Riitala, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
The product-specific data shall be collected with the consent of the customer and shall be used with a licence for marketing.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
Pretty few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Economic Sanom.
He said Kesko is not going to react to the change in registration of the S group.
Kesko is already categorising its main customer according to only the food purchases to ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for the marketing targeted to the customer.
The product-specific purchase information is collected only from the K group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a Stamm Customer Programme, and there is no such thing as this.
Finland’s Middle Trade has its own One-Bonus Customer Programme, which can be associated with in Selection Houses, Siwomes and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we are not collecting product or product group data, we remain at the level of the final receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made, and that day, and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We haven't gone to that level like the K group or the S group, says the commercial leader Anu Ora.
He believes that the PSP will be reformed in the future, but the Middle Trade will talk about it later.
However, Ora does not allow the registration of product information.
Testing at first
The SOK Customer Owner and Customer Register has been relatively wide until now.
The basic information included not only personal and address information but also professional, educational, housing and childbirth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase date and time, the place, the final amount of the purchases and the way of payment have been recorded in the S-Independence Card purchase.
In addition, information from the S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, the product level purchase information will be deposited in Sokos and Emotion chains.
However, data are currently recorded at product group level in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terro and ABC chains.
Customers have had longer hopes that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owner and Partner Activities of SOK.
S Group says they're informing their customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data are recorded with bags in any case, wanted it or not.
The applicant may check the data deposited on the S group website.
For example, the cash registers are unable to access information, emphasised by Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is Tull's latest dog confirmation - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The baby of the black labrador is vigilantly sniffing five crates of similar lands in line at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long when it sits firmly next to the middle box.
The customs inspector Lassi Sunito rewards his dog Heila to play it with that favorite toy.
In the box next to which Heila was sitting, a bottle of crucible shelves were discovered.
Furniture gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Sunito, owner of the Heila dog.
Security and access conditions for online trade
Heila is the first dog specialised in the search for weapons and explosives in Tull and is placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Job assignments may also lead to other border crossing stations and ports when needed by Heila and Sunito.
However, the airport will be the main job in Heila, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in Customs, and the surveillance has been confirmed after the attacks, says Superintendent of Customs, Mikko Grönberg.
Secondly, postal broadcasts travelling through Helsinki-Vanta are the responsibility for training weapons and explosive dogs.
As a result of growing internet trade, up to 40 million posts are carried through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered abroad.
During the last few years, the customs authorities have made some 300 discoveries of online purchases, passenger baggage and air freight at Helsinki Airport, arms parts, ammunition and explosives, as well as their origins.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate registered baggage and mail.
In the future, it will have a great benefit when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Tulli estimates whether weapons and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg welcomes the idea.
School in the Church
The training of the Heila Pennus is coordinated by the Dog School of Tull in Kirkkoum.
Sunito also attends training with Heila at police and defence experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the defence forces' expertise in explosives.
Together with other authorities, the customs authorities decide what smells Heila is being taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues in Helsinki Airport have six drug dogs in Tull and a money and drug dog in Massi.
Heila, the labrador, has been elected from the ten puppies' puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog to be chosen at the airport include collision and hunting, as well as calmness, as the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human streams.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Without Heila, there's nowhere at home, Sunito's laughing.
Fine orders are going to Heila for a one-time liege.
The midnight-Sanom cameraman loses a fast dog's microwave, but Heila will return a soft toy cover immediately from the command "shoot".
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, which assesses whether training is sufficient for required tasks.
Heila can be seen at work in Helsinki Airport next half of the year if everything goes as planned.
Unfortunately, travellers cannot come to iron the working vests on the dog, reminds Sunito.
One working dog costs approximately EUR 60000 to 70000 per year for customs duties.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active workouts will only last from ten minutes to two hours.
The owner of the work dogs is a tough competition in Tull.
Heila's owner was picking up about 20-30 Customs employees.
Fortunately, Suntion was hit by someone who has never had a work dog before, but has years of experience with dogs and supervisors in Tull.
The Mini State has its first Olympic Medal - the people will have a day off
The Olympic Gold of Fiji, with less than a million inhabitants, in rugby, is so high in the country that the government has appointed the national day of August 22 for free.
According to the country’s broadcasting company, the Fiji government confirmed the issue after the mastership was solved.
The day off will be held on the team's returning home the next day.
The hero team is also allowed to celebrate in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated championship.
The Guardian says that the final in the country was followed in the capital of Suva, where a screen was set up for the stadium.
Normally only the native Fijis are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants, they watched the game, I heard them encourage, said Fiji Times reporter Mayele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish Adult fainted after a terrible performance
The printing player Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt for 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening quality as a lifter.
During or immediately after the lifting of the fines, he's fainted several times.
No one has ever been able to say why.
Tokola scored 1,75 pounds and 145 pounds of pace in Rio.
His result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last push of 1,75 pounds, as did the other one.
In the third attempt, the weights were rising as a grind of screaming.
The corpse would tremble under the weight until the judge's accepting the lift.
The joy of the finnish worshiper was frightened by the fact that he had suffered problems on his knees.
RoPS acquired an Estonian raider Prosan - Flagship - Evening Sanomas
The Rovaniemen Ball Society, who plays in the men's football League, has concluded a sustainable agreement with the Estonian league Albert Prosa.
We're looking for a team top player with power and a threshold for Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
More than 10 players agents and I went through over 50 players all over the world.
Prosa, Coach of RoPS, told Juha Maline in the newsletter, started to be a good option.
Prosa, 25, arrives to RoPS from a farmer in Flora, where he made 51 goals in 109 matches.
He's also played in the Estonian country team.
Prosan is supposed to be with RoPS on Saturday on the Wall River, where the Rovaniemians meet the master of the Finnish SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when Alexander Kokko, the earthly King of the last season, moved to Australia.
The Threat Modern Family Star reappears: Teenage shorts reveal almost everything
The Modern Family Comedy Series, which are nicely known as Alex Dunphyna, Ariel Winter, blasted again by presenting his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week at minishorts, who don't leave much of the imagination.
The Shorts revealed not only the artist's legs but also the back of this.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making its style and use much more bold.
The star has posed in the pictures published in the social media in very little clothes and taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressing in very short costumes.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it from here.
Previously this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his publicity picture so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter had a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He's been on TV almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashians.
He has learned that the more he shows the surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has aggravated some of his long-term fans with their imago movements.
It is not difficult to guess where he is in ten years, when the lowest thing is already so hard, says a woman in Winter's Instagram.
Instead, some of the women’s fans defend the actor and urge them to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what others say.
You're inspiring a lot of women, shaking a young woman.
The Japanese preferably want tourists from the Nordic countries to Finland attracted by revonts: In the autumn, it is possible to see the occasional Mirror urora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start retreating trips in the early autumn, Visit Finland says in the newsletter.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of the Japanese reconnaissance tourism.
The backlights are valve cards for our winter tourism and are closely connected with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
Lapland's winter retreats have a great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sale of autumn trips.
Few people know that the tranquilizer is starting from early autumn and continues far to spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called Mirror aurora, where the lake’s surface reflects revolving lights by making the vision of two multipliers of the occasional, says in the visit Finland’s newsletter, the marketing manager Anne Lind.
The main destinations of the Visit Finland revalidation campaign are wealthy 25-35 years old, Japanese women living in town dreaming of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things, by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by the Aalto University and researchers at the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique sightseeings from Finland, and this revonette has, according to Lind, a huge potential.
The overnight stays of Japanese tourists have grown considerably more than other Nordic countries in Finland.
Last year, they stayed over double more in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested as a target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
The Japanese average spent EUR 183 a day in Finland, says Lind.
The British had to be happy with the silver rugby-7 race when Fidz's championship won gold
The impressive success of the United Kingdom in the rugby race of seven players was crushed when Fidzi won it on Thursday in the final of the Rio Deodoro Stadium, chapters 43 to 7.
Fidzi gave the masters a lesson in the treatment of balloons, transfers, side-trainings, support games, runways and racing lines, and so won gold — if it was the first Olympic medal in its entire history.
The death meant silver, which was a slightly smaller comfort for Britain, because it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They could be proud of their success as the Olympics in the first Rugby-7 tournament where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The strong victory from the Bokses of South Africa in the semi-final of chapters 7 to 5 earlier on the same day could have negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, Fidz's team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full strength.
Great Britain may be comforted by the fact that at least one British will have a gold mill in his neck tomorrow: Ben Ryan, the head coach of Fidz, former English Rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
There's been quite a lot of experience for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games at the Adelaide Sevens tournament in Ryan's training.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
Killing hurts, but progress is shocking.
Fidz started excellently and presented his tac skills to the UK as for fun.
It looked like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team were hit by moving buses, and world champions got up 5-0 when Osea Kolinsau hit the corner.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwai made a second goal from a paint trap.
The situation 12-0, and the UK had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell’s great tack was prevented from making the third goal of Leone Nakarawa, but it didn’t slow Fidz down long.
When the game was played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu made a goal to the right corner, and then the United Kingdom was losing 17-0.
Nakarawa made another goal from the further launch, when the first half of the game was still over a minute.
After this, Vatemo Ravouvou snatched the British team through more powerful tacks and crossed the target line.
After the terrain, the opening period ended between 29 and 0.
It seemed that the Fijis were born to play the rugby of seven players, while the British still play the role of pupils.
Which is very true.
The UK made extensive changes in half time and managed to hold the Fijis for four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova made the goal thanks to the excellent team of the Fiji.
Dan Norton managed to narrow into a situation by making Britain to the left corner of the goal, but the game had been lost long ago to the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans were singing at the view, swinging tickets and dancing.
Fidz's purely cheerful attitude was hard to not be admired.
Mata Viliame made a finish for the Fiji cake by making the goal in the last few minutes.
The pill sounded, the Fijis embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier on the day Fidzi had won the Japanese semi-final from 20 to 5 and the United Kingdom had swept over South Africa in a tight semifinal where the British goal trap was resolved.
Kyle Brown took South Africa's Boks to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with his glowing footwork and flipped under the goal dots in the second half.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of Anthony Watson, the rugby team of the 15 players in England, embedded the victory and finally the silver medal.
The coach’s fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glower and Heather Stanning to make gold
The more emotional of this could not be gold in these races.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning made 220 winning bets into history and found a new purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were two in the hills, on the boat the third was the voice of coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to join their second consecutive Olympiad in the double of women, making them the first women in the history of British sport, which reaches a similar achievement.
Their overpower was unquestionable, their victory was already 39th success and once again remarkable.
What we see, two great athletes joining the surface of the water like floating age is not entirely in line with the nature of success.
There is a large number of helpable hands behind each march, each of which has taken the twins towards achievements. However, the most important thing to do is the coach who diagnosed cancer 30 months ago, and who did not then know if he would see this day.
Williams said the situation was tight at that time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor was cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes a bit of thinking."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The triangle was lucky that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the seasonal period of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little damage as possible if it could even be said in such circumstances.
"I was looking for money, so I had to heal quickly.
It worked as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department 6, 9 and 15 metres at a time when they said that a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
It's already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the twin’s thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and talked a little more than normal in trying to overcome his own trouble.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery Force, who was behind the Afghanistan cruise, says: "I have been ruined this week, which may be a little extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we worked together with Helen and Robin.
The last three years in Helen and Robin's trunk have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so it's a crazy big thanks to him, he's the world's best coach.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost any competition in the last five years.
The twin has found an overwhelming rhythm to which their competitors have failed to draw.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very busy in the moment.
Helen said, "Hold with me, stay with you."
It's very important not to get off the track."
"We were lucky to leave well, and at the same time we were not trying to do anything amazing.
We didn't pursue the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did."
The twin's gonna think about a year before he decides about his future.
Next month, Glover will celebrate his wedding with Steve Backshall, a friend of the television nature programs.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London, it took about six months before I realized I was a Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland will change the government of Panama leaks
In October, Iceland will organise premature parliamentary elections, which will be demanded by the protesters who were raged by Panama's data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed tax avoided by several Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson divorced because of the scandal, but it wasn't enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to organise new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29th.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the recent rage of the people will affect the outcome of the elections in the autumn.
In June the presidential elections clearly showed criticism of the power-holders, and Gudni Johannesson, who had been elected outside the policy, was elected as President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he said Obama was the founder of Isisi.
The presidential candidate for the United States Republicans, Donald Trump, cancelled his latest speeches.
He said that he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting president Barack Obama would be the founder of Isisi's terrorist organization and a democratic candidate for the establishment of the Hillary Clinton organization.
The Democratic Party got mad at the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can fall down like that, Clinton's twit.
In Southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a moslim-favored burkin-swimming suit on the beaches, says among other things the British newspaper Guardia.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to beaches and swims for all who do not have a good habit and a secularist bathing suit.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which largely express religious links, can increase the risk of order disruption in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In the middle of July, 85 people died and hundreds of injured in Nice, when a 31 - year - old man drove to the French National Day of the People’s Party.
At the end of July, two extremists connected to Isisi attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of the bathing waters of Oulu penetrated the screen - the blue seam of the Lake of Fishing
Water samples taken from official bathing beaches in the Oulu area meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only bleaching seams have been observed on the bathing zone of the Lake Swimming Pool.
Over Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental activity of Oulu took water samples from nine EU shores in Oulu region and 30 other general bathing areas.
With the exception of the beach of Meriniemi, the concentrations of all bathing waters of E.coli and gastro-cocactic bacteria in the bathing zones were below the measures laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
E.coli and enterococococcus levels of the bathing zone of the sealine were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had decreased below the operating limits.
The blue sealing that was observed on the swimming pool of the lake does not yet make the water intact, but under favourable conditions, the situation can quickly become a blueberry snack, making the water a blueberry in the form of skirts.
Environmental action will monitor the situation with the most intensified inspections.
If the bluefin tuna becomes a blueberry, it will also be reported separately on the bathing zone reporting table.
Look at the results of the bathing water samples from here.
MTK Käkrainen Forest Gender Reduction: more than 80% of forest owners outside
The deduction of forests is one of the tax changes in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance for next year.
Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax for the generation exchange of forestry.
In the presentation by the Ministry of Finance of Forest Gender Reduction, there are four objectives: to promote generation exchanges of forest holdings, to younger age structures of forest owners, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the pure capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forestry farms is good, comment on Juha Käkrainen, head of the Central Union of Agriculture and Forest Producers (MTK).
However, it is deaf to find criticism in the proposed tax change.
Forest gift reductions are presented as a task of the pure capital income of the forest owner.
This is the capital income from which all other reductions have been deducted.
In the opinion of the MTK and Käkrainen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be higher if the reduction could be made directly from the profits of the tree.
The VM proposal is based on a reduction in the pure capital income of forestry by preventing the loss of the capital income of forestry which would be reduced by other taxation.
Such a person would benefit from tax, even if he did not sell a tree.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to figure it out, says Käkrainen.
In addition, the model concerns only a small part of forest owners.
The limit on tax reductions linked to the value of the forest is EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled up in Käkrainen's minds too high.
As such, he said that 82 percent of Finnish forest owners were removed from the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the border guarantees the purpose of the farming.
Forest policy has taken the deforestation to Käkraen for decades.
It is behind the ageing of the forest owners.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful rakecuro surprised the car drivers in Himanga... two cars swept into a stream and hit each other.
There was a special ride on the Kala River in the morning.
According to the rescue facility, two cars in successively driven were swept into their streams, after which the behind came in crashing after the predator.
According to Harri Pythti, the firefighter of a friend is suspected of a massive hauling of the stream.
Back in time there were two people in the car who were both transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more accurate information on their injuries.
The driver of the above-wheel car wasn't hurt.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 from Himanga, a few miles towards the Fish River.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings of the academic professor Johanna Ivaska study group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases cancer’s malignancy.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow in the usual way in such a environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of the cancer was prevented under laboratory conditions by replacing the cancer surrounding tissue to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study have been published on 4 August in the Nature Communications, a reviewed site in the field of cell biology.
The death of Muhoos' family continues in the court, the prosecution also demands a murder charge for another offender.
The death of the family of Muhoos continues in the court for both prisoners.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the death of a family home in Muhona.
One received 8 years of 4 months of murder and brutal robbery, including as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment for murder and brutal robbery committed as a young person.
The prisoner was also convicted of a serious threat to road safety as a young person and the transport of a vehicle as a young person.
The prosecutor, the prosecutors, the lawyers and the man who had a harder judgment.
The prosecution demands a lesser man to be sentenced for murder as a young person to be sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to the law, 17-year-old young people killed a man who worked as director of the child protection unit last year in July.
The 17-year-old who was sentenced to murder attacked the director on the couch of the living room.
The director had been able to get rid of it and brought the young man into his room when one of the young ones hit him with a vacuum tube.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to the mind study, both judges were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape the family home at least since the day before.
The ice shark is the longest spine in the world, growing only at the age of 156
The longest living backbone in the world has been confirmed by the ice shark, says a research published in the Science magazine.
In the northern part of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark swimming around Greenland, that is, the holger can live up to 400 years old.
The female grows only at the age of 156.
I iced my life. It only grows a centimetre a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than icefish.
Scientists found age by radio carbide.
Because of the nuclear experiments in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
They suggest that researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
For the age of the oldest, 392 years were estimated, but the throwing in the direction or the other could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump Economics - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the world.
Even a third of all the tax revenues of the State would not be received if the change in the corporate tax carried out by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also decrease in particular with the most profitable tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax programme as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
Business tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without collecting a really great amount, $1,000 a year.
The higher income tax rate is now 39.6, after the reduction proposed by Trump 33.
They'd give up the inheritance tax.
Trump blamed the State for excessive regulation of the business and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The agreed environmental standards must be reintroduced and the energy regulation should be decommited.
The reform of Barack Obama's health care needs to be dealt with.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
The "destructive" trade policy is, according to Trump, the major causes of the US problems.
Free trade agreements would be renounced.
For importation from China, 45% would be disrupted and for Mexico a fine tax of 35%.
We offer you a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our belief, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American aeroplanes will combine cities, American ships to control seas, American steel to raise new clouds throughout the country.
By contrast, Trump read the speech written by the assistants loyally, even though well organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those close to the Republicans, see that the Trump programme will take the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton published his program early on Friday in Finland.
An attack wave of the past - People's News
The sea is mourning fateously, but the actual wave of attack strikes in the middle of Madrid's street fountain -- accounting with the past can begin.
There's a focus on Pedro Almodóvar's news story.
The previous management work of Almodovar Travel lovers (2013) was a little fun and a satirious comedy in the middle of the past, where I live (2011) as a Spanish pioneer.
Likely, Juliet (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a contemporary love, human relationship and family drama with a mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and we'll see a lot of it as a long backbone.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to fall.
A new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) must be marvelous at the end of the movie.
In the form of a back and long letter, Juliet once the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
He began from the time before the daughter was born, the moment when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julietata as a young teacher is rising from Adraina Ugarte, a TV-suited series between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's ageing has been handled in a way that can be considered as a cake, but I would say that it is timely and literally with a single wipe.
For Almodóvar films, often, there is a fair distance to such a characteristic sensitivity in the sense of humor in Julieta.
It is a flat-rated, restrained film with good music in a place and a rather sad film, which contains ingredients of its election.
Instead, the typical visual discolouration of the Spanish director is maintained and begins to inject a little quietly into the eye more in a clean form than as an active dramatic means of action.
People in films experience diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains the same Korean.
This applies in particular to the costume: in the case of a name person, the costumes change from the scene to the other, and the same applies to the visible ears.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main point is that the impact is not particularly improved.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly breathless.
Almodóvar has written a script on the basis of three novels of the Canadian Alice Munro, rewarded by Nobel 2013.
The novels have been published in the work of the Floor: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly balanced written literature filming.
The material would have been emotionally unlike the steepest drama, the great things that the film deals with, especially the bleak guilt.
Control and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
In the main sections: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
It's 12.8 film pre-night.
Government tries elections - People's News
There are no new cuts to be made, the ministers say, so that the basic Finns do not collapse totally.
However, the surgeries decided in the spring are made with a robbery.
There will be no new surgery.
The four billion savings already decided will be sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centric) and Minister of Finance, Petter Orpo (Kok.) under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that the VM proposal does not contain any new cuts, since the cuts of social security were already decided in the spring framework.
Children's allowance, national pensions, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the population pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of unemployment security is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training surgery continues.
Rehabilitation is haunted
Why are the ministers so hard to emphasise that no further cuts are made on them?
Because next year is the year of election.
The municipalities will be held in April and are the most important heat meter in the electoral term, not the gallus.
It has been seen before that the fitness outcome of the government parties in different directions will ruin the government's mood for a long time.
However, the Gallups tell us that the Government Party's fundamental Finns are waiting for a blowdown, although the result of its previous elections was modest, compared to the parliamentary elections, 12.3 per cent.
Four years ago, the main Finns received 752 new authorised persons, many of whom will be realised at the cost of influence in the right government next spring.
The life line of the government of about equally large three parties is in the reserve that the position of the main Finns endures.
It has not been lasting now, but more than half of the parties voted in favour of government policy already during the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visits have also come to the surface.
Firstly, the new cuts will not come to light the fact that they will be done hard next year and the second attempt is to soften the expected attack on the main Finns.
Great surgery in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different - if the government of Sipilah is still standing up.
The government has set its goal to change the debt in this parliamentary period, but the budget proposal by Petter Orpo will take EUR 5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipalities, the government has two options.
The first is to put hands up in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: the debt is not slowed or even slowed down.
The other one is to keep up with the program.
This means new, even harder cuts in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would at least be drawn close to balance during 2018 and then, in the spring, the elections will be taken against what will come.
With these measures, the debt is unfavourable.
It is absolutely clear that the current measures do not change the debt, even though Juha Sipila is trying to squeeze a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäen at the information meeting at the budget are unreasonable:
World economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no support from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except in the context of a temporary recovery policy at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent over this decade, with an average length of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment will now cost EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
In the course of the week, public debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, rises to 70% in the mid-term of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt-recovery submitted by the Left Union was rejected as it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about EUR 6 billion, which is practically fully covered by new debts.
This is the idea of the centre, the meeting and the fundamental Finns of what is responsible.
Question: A lot of tasks are left to the municipalities
Three out of four believe that the organisation of child day care, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, it appears from the study of the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people is also responsible for the individual community for libraries, culture, civil schools, construction supervision, high school training and waste management.
The country's responsibility will be more determined by the country's co-operation, specialised hospitals, vocational training, higher education schools and the institution care of disabled people.
No responsibilities under the responsibility of the municipalities are to be transferred to the State.
A low-aged ride was running after the chase, running away from the police.
A 16 - year - old motorcycler, Joensuu, drove a police force to escape at Joensuu Ilomantsi on Friday night at half a time.
The police team tried to stop the motorcycle without lights, but the young man went to drive the police away from a fair speed.
The rear drive continued to the Sinkajanrantway, from which the Sorronahontee and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
After this, the young man ran away, but a faster policeman ran after the fugitive.
The ventilation test for the driver showed 0.75 promilles.
Nor did he have a driving licence that would have justified driving on a motorcycle.
The case is examined, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock cargo fell into a stream
The truck in the rock cargo crashed on the Polvi lake at 9:15 a.m. on Thursday night at the Caveyard.
The truck had driven out of the road and crashed on his side of the stream in the left corner.
The rescue facility lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door, together with the rescue helicopter's staff and the first caregivers.
The car owner was responsible for raising the vehicle.
From the straped truck, hydraulic oil flowed on the road, which was absorbed by the rescue plant.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon at the Air River.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in the Lahden village of the Lahden River in South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about 165 centimetres long, shiny and delicious with hair that reaches the white chin.
The findings and tips of the missing movements are requested to call the northern situation centre reference number 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air... see the gallery of the ruins of Parafest.
The parafest festival's tents have been knocked down by a burst flow causing massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be able to get on its feet financially, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last performer of the Parafest, Kalle Salonen, appeared on a torso after Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances held at the urban theatre premises from 13 a.m.
The art center in Ahjo is the Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme is scheduled.
The flow of flutters occurs in the cloud when the rainwater and its weight start the decreasing flow of air.
Changes in the water form of the cloud bind the heat, so the decreasing atmosphere cools and speeds towards the ground.
It is reported from the aeronautics Institute that in Finland, in several summers, crash flows occur.
It's hard to predict the path of the flash flows.
On Friday afternoon, before the fiveth, the event site of Parafest was hit by the collision flow at the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum.
Three tents fell into reversal with a total of 200 people in the tents.
In an accident, four people were mildly insulted.
There was one child in the group who was carried to further treatment with mildly injured.
Air pollution obsolete Londoners
According to the study, the Londoner skin grows faster than usual.
The reason for the skin's ageing is air pollution.
The British research reports Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than the agemate in the countryside.
Small particles of the skin are very fine dust pollutants from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases that, according to Evening Standard, are killed by nearly 9 500 Londoners every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who travel their business trips in the vicious streets.
London’s residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with masks, but regular skin cleaning is recommended as a more practical solution.
Traktor's brakes failed to push the man standing in front.
The man had moved stones in his yard circle with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to walk in front of it, the tractor’s brakes failed and the tractor turned on the man.
The man did not get under it, but the tractor was able to push the man so much that he was transported to the central hospital as he was seriously injured.
The tractor didn't make it further because it hit the stones in front of him.
Discourse to the newest force in the future
The Riverman Gaga-Riento, playing in the Balloon Championship, departs from a better set of starting in October than a male memory.
The team's been together for three weeks.
The common line is certainly better found than in the previous periods when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisu, who continues as the head coach of the Rieno, commends the new team for enterprise and unity.
From a foreign triangle, Fred Muson is starting his second period in Rieno.
The new faces are the 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson from the Rwanda country team is a 205 centimeter hacker.
Garchet is a passport, the Brazilian has 198 cents.
Through Josha, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. Country Team
Anne Partneren has played in almost all the gym clubs since 2003.
Now Tampere is already on its sixth race, only 2013 was missed since Canada was better in North America.
I was working in Turku and playing with those women when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a salibandy country team.
I'm interested, and here we are, Partner, 48, says.
A partner was born in 1967 in Elizabeth, near New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987, the partnership was able to study data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, a species like that hasn't yet been played at the SM level like a gym bandy.
They played a flash at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in the River Boys hockey in the SM series, partner remembers.
The partner played with the University in the Salibady SM series during the period 1991-92, the following three of them went through Josba.
In addition to playing, she trained the company A girls for the championship.
The SM series of women culminated in silver in 1995.
Totally, the partner played in the SM series of women through the 10th series, in 169 matches 51+34=85.
The latest SM season is 2001-2002.
Pertus Puska and Tatu Vääänen were named for the country team
Josban of the Joensuu Salibandy Society was raised by Perttu Puska and the enzootic Tatu Vääänen was selected as part of the Finnish rural team, which plays at the Tscheki Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In Helsinki, the 25-year-old Pertus Puska, attacking the Era, has played before this six men's landings, where he has a total of 9+4=13 power points.
The 32-year-old defender of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen Tatu Väääänen has recovered from the tramp and belongs to the country team's standard fish with 117 landings experience.
Mika Kohonen was also appointed to the rural team in the Seinäjoki game player, who was seen in the Finnish shirt last December in the MM race.
The main coach of the Salibandian team is Petri Kettunen, the Gulf of Contio.
The Beach volley artist Essi Hasu circle closes to Kouvola - the SM Gold is missing in the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is going to end as a beach volley player, at least after a temporary period.
Beach volley Finnish Championships will be solved this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
For three days, the medals are played in both adults and young people's series.
In cooperation with the SM final tournament organised by the Kouvola Airball players and the Finnish Airball Association, the six best pairs in each series are eligible.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elissi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Now Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to the lookout this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the Pesisstadion.
I haven't played in adult shows so often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in finals in home corners, Hasu mood.
Kouvola’s area lit Hasu into sports and gave her a good meal for a fancy hobby.
There are good memories of childhood.
When I was nine, I started a balloon at E-girls at Elimäe NMKY.
The top of the mind is too large to play shirts, knees around the ankles, ashes and choreographs after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small place, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's common spirit created a environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were closely involved... with the teammate's father coached us, and our mother was the leader of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was a natural type choice for the counterweight of the balloon.
The swimming pool of the nest sheep has been playing songs since the 1990s.
Action has always been active.
I also went to follow the Juniors' SM Tour, thinking that someday I'd be there to play.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays this weekend together with Annina Parkkinen in the SM-finals.
After the Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahde, the goal of the second dual that has been punished for the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We're still missing a SM-Good, and Hasu throws it mysteriously.
The event of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last of Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges in civil work are awaiting.
Yes, the international career is over after the tournament at the Rivalcallio.
By the way, the toes are put in the nail, at least temporarily, hasu is planning.

Solomon’s Koli boldly left as a farmer
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means taking risks, sweating and vigorousness.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future in rural areas too.
Shortly two years ago, Coli, together with his little brother, Valter Kol, began working as a rebel to their home.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and counsels brothers with their own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking debts and increasing orders so that the bread could become hand-in-hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to go to the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think we have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a pieton water, and the bank was not interested either at first.
However, I myself have been very boldly involved in the project, and I have been fully involved, Solomon Koli tells and adds that he would not have taken action if he had not believed in producing a pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The goal of Solomon Kol, who grows meat cars, is to invest in even bigger beans.
The work has resulted because Solomon’s Koli has been chosen to be among the best ten in the competition of the young food producer of the Earth’s Future magazine.
At best, he's competing for a possible win.
He'll be able to vote on the web page of the magazine until 21.8.
Bulgaria first reports inflation to eight months

The average annual inflation measured by the CPI in the last 12 months (up to July 2015) compared to the previous 12 months (up to July 2014) was –0.8 %.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0 % compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0 %.
Since the beginning of the year, inflation rate (percent of July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been –0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 was –0.2% compared to July 2015.

Snapchat's anime efficiency is criticised as an Asian caricathyre
Snapchat says that this filter was an anime inspiring, but some observers think it is racist.
With the Snapchat lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that align absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an ananas, dog or character in Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Linstics are impregnable, character-shaped tools to create more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day.
All misleading steps quickly come to general knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have received a review where it has been accused of favouring blackface makeup or whitened skins as a beauty glove.
So when it offered to some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into pruning, misleaded teeth and made cheeks, some critics called it a racist chalicty of Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered whether these recurring conflicts suggest a larger problem that the company has with differentities.
The news and rage spread on Wednesday and wrote online publications The Verge and Motherboard day after Snapchat told me that he had removed the filter.
The company explained the following: the lens was intended for anime fame, not for a chalicity of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of insulting stereotypes.
Some of them stumbled against anime comparison.
The Korean-American Art Student Grace Sparapani, whose twittets were widely distributed, said in his e-mail that the lens was "at least insulting and embarrassing".
He adds: "It is difficult to dispute the parallelation of a very delicate Asian caricature with the effects of the filter.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but one that has been taken to a degrading extreme."
Snapchat is not the only attempt to avoid these cultural traps.
The American culture seems to have an endless struggle of diversity and social involvement from corporate governments to Hollywood and equipment that we carry with us.
The public of Snapchat consists of young people who are more ethnic backgrounds than their parents’ responses. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more subtleness.
"When one of the Snapchat lenses creates a picture that hurts the user, things like this will no longer be very easy to notice, as previously," said Katie Zhu 25 on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as head of the product and designer in the medium publishing vessel, decided on Thursday to remove her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In his article and telephone interview at the media, he said that the conflicts in ethnicity reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticises the company mostly of the management of white and only men and decided to write on the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that there are no colored people in their unilateral staff, where they can make such decisions, or that they also have colored workers, but their position is not such that they would dare to express their opinions directly and easily," says Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but mostly Snapchat has failed to reply to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, increasing its position as a private enterprise.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of his staff, but according to his informant, the company has recently hired a recruiter with the aim of focusing on underrepresented groups of people and promoting participation within the company.
For their part, Zhu says that he is keeping his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
According to the Congress Expert Group, military officials distorted intelligence on Isisisi
On Thursday, the Congress Expert Group published a report that officials of the United States Armed Forces, Central Command, changed the intelligence reports by giving a more optimistic picture of war against Issis in Iraq and Syria than the events on the field gave rise to understanding.
The Heads of the Republican Subcommittee for Intelligence and Defence Resources of the Council of the United States Representatives' Committee (House Armed Services Committee) set up a working group, in which the mid-term report describes the "unsatisfiedness of the military intelligence officers".
Central Command, shortly Centcom, is the United States Armed Forces headquarters in the state of Florida in Tampa, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence reports approved by the senior leaders of Centcom gave a more positive picture of the anti-terrorism measures in the United States than the facts in the field showed, and were exceptionally positiver than the analysis of other units in the intelligence community," says the press release on the report.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable – our soldiers are suffering when false analyses are presented to high-level political decision-makers," says Ken Calvert, California Republican representative.
"Centcom's leadership failures reach the highest level of the organisation."
The 10-page report details the continuing problems identified in 2014 and 2015, which include the descriptions and analyses of Central Commandi's activities on American activities to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports ordered by Obama's administrations were fake, it will give an analyst picture of the fact that Centcom's leaders would have pushed them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isisi.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, opinions and statements made to the Central Command were much more positive than what was actually happening," says the report.
"For example, the Centcom official publicly issued a statement that a large military battle to take Mosul back could already be held in April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Isisi.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says the Republican representative of Kansas, Mike Pompeo, in the press release.
"After mid-2014, in the middle of 2015, the U.S. Armed Forces' Highest Intelligence Directors manipulated the intelligence received to minimise Isisi’s threat in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a working group after they knew the doubts expressed by analysts that the intelligence on Isisisi would have been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will follow more precise results, as the studies will continue.
In addition, the investigator of the Ministry of Defence has launched the Centcom intelligence investigation.
On Thursday, the members of the Committee responsible for Parliament's Inquiry published their own results, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"In the period 2014-2015, the Centcom created a too limited process to evaluate intelligence information on Isisi and Iraqi security forces," says Adam B. Schiff, the High Representative of the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process "is delayed the publication of the intelligence results, "infringed the morality of analysts" and "inadequately different views".
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to push the Centcom analysts to adapt their conclusions to a "predetermined or politically official line".
The Daily Beast news site reported the preliminary results of the Congress on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported about the Pentagon supervisor's investigation, which was initiated as a result of the complaints made by Centcom's analysts.
The Pentagon reporter, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, says in his report that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the Congress report as long as the investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: "The experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has other consequences, in addition to trying to determine whether the bombings led by the United States have been successful in Iraq and Syria (an argument made by several defence authorities).
However, the allegations made last year questioned how much President Obama can rely on Central Command and to give honest assessments of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the Fathers' intelligence corresponds to the disagreements that occurred over a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that, despite the protests of many analysts, President George W. Bush's government supported only small troops to Iraq and took only a little time to reflect what would be followed by the 2003 invasion of the country.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against Isisi intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Working Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, air strikes in Isisi’s controlled refineries had not significantly undermined the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries and thus was able to sell oil on the dark market.
However, the outcome of the study was not transmitted outside the Central Command, reported in September by The Times.
The Centcom commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, had been criticised last year after many legislators had judged that the statements of witnesses to the Senate were too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he replaced the commander of Central Command, General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins the fourth duel in women's country hockey and stabilizes their position for interdisciplinary discussions with Britain
After making three goals in the win, Katie Bam made the first two goals on Thursday when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had previously succeeded in the same way.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who count on the paintings they make."
But he knows this: the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and share the first place in their group with the United Kingdom, which continued to win their profit pipes on Thursday in Japan, chapters 2 to 4.
Britain and the United States are playing the first round in the last game on Saturday.
Both teams survived the final match that determines which of them is the first and second of the six teams.
First of all, avoiding a longer time meeting with a hard-core Dutch team that won the second block.
Despite the way it goes on Saturday, the Americans have already raised their surprising success in these races, four years after it remained the last of 12 teams in the Olympics in London.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell in the state of Pennsylvania and took his country hockey country for the first time when he was three years old (who older double sisters played the species in Drexel).
He missed the Olympics in 2008 when he failed to cope with the final player list.
After this, the 2012 races came, where he and his team were not very successful.
The following year, Craig Parnham was appointed an English coach, and then things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our work in London was not what it is now.
We've made a complete translation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the paint account in the first half by hitting the ball near a cramp.
India had come to the game without any tournament victory, but it proved to be a surprisingly hard opponent and kept the 1-0 situation until the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball a long time along the left side of the field, swept into the middle field, hit the ball on the finish line and took the Americans to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the last goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first tournament where the American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games of the American goal had fallen in each one hit.
Briggs is now living his success,
The same way Bam did.
"We have a good attitude now," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
♪ In the middle of the Olympia curin ♪ ♪ Trampoline ♪ ♪ Brings Zen ♪
Regardless of location and time, the Olympics will be encountered inevitably.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to be the next intense message constantly and everywhere.
As an olympiad fire itself would be a flame - blowing message cap, moving from a bowballer to a swimmer, from a swimmer to a gymnast and from a gymnast to a triathlonist.
You can't open television, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the line of the cafe without having to hear about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first time of the Olympics, with a charming smile and might well be the name of everyone on their lips that would appear and belong to the best watch and listen time, would be favoured by the sponsors and appear in TV advertising of a good mind if she was just a swimmer, a gymnastic or even a swordmaster.
But Dooley 28, from the Lake Forest of California, competes with the Olympic Gold Trampoliin.
The Olympic Fire does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Far from the center, partly in the shadow, there are less known sports, such as air pistol shooting, boogy shooting, close balloon and taekwondo.
We'll always have breast-feed, and let the mastership be with us for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to write a modest story about my own special favourites, I'd like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been the Olympic species since the year 2000 in Sydney, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so small that many people who have interviewed did not even know it was the Olympic species.
Unconsciousness can be per region.
The United States have participated in the Olympiatrampoline, but the country has never reached the medals or progressed to the finals until 2012.
In the trampoline of men, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and the women on the side of the medal are the two Canadians.
China Dong Dong and the Canadian Rosie MacLenna are defending the gold medals they won in London this year.
Trampoliin, however, has the charm of the underdog, partly because in an uncivilized ear it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympics.
(I recognise in this context that I am not a expert, only a common fan.)
The species have their coma potential, which has been used in drawing films in endless cheerleaders of characters, but they also have the same dignity as in gymnastics and swimming, i.e. species that are essentially united in trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trempolín, which means "support board".
Amazing masters jump with a huge trampoline that rubs them up to a height of nearly 10 metres. Before they land on their feet, a series of acrobatical movements, such as tours, skills and volts, must be made.
According to the official Olympia programme, jumps are assessed on the basis of performance, difficulty and "air time".
In Rio there are 32 athletes coming from 17 different countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
The medal brains must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes backwards around the field.
In addition to the painting line or the departure wall, they also have another objective that they are seeking in television-based reporters, namely a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is luxuriant, admirable, even fanatic — and even enough to get a looker to tears.
But I also think this is a little exhausting just in view of the races.
This is where the trampoline offers a breathing break.
Trampoliin is heading upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast trims up weightlessly like an astronaut, drops down, and stings back up without trouble.
Of course, there is also a competition aspect, and it is not easy either, but it does not have to do with an intense attack on the goal or jumping far, only a dreamy and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to the Zen as the Olympia race can get away.
Women's quarrying and finals will be held on Friday afternoon and begin at 13.00 local time and men will match the games on Saturday at the same time.
NBC sends finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, starting on each day at 14.00 a.m. local time.
In the midst of the Olympics, a peaceful and wonderful moment will be brought, which could be missed in the middle of the general hull.
And if consciousness can only be increased by offering attractive male sportsmen and by offering them an object – as recently suggested by the US male opponents Wall Street Journal – in that case Logan Dooley expects only to thrill their new fans.
A whole generation protested in Ethiopia, a long-term ally to the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
The government's troops have disrupted protests on various sides of Ethiopia requiring political change.
According to witnesses, several demonstrators have been shot to death in collisions with the police.
Ethiopia breaking up?
For the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries and a reliable ally to the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
However, in recent months, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations, which are spreading to wider areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people went to the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was pathetic.
According to witnesses, the police shot and killed several unarmed demonstrators.
Consumably at the end of last year or the videos described at the beginning of this year show how security forces strike young people who have been forced to stand against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights officer now calls for thorough research.
"Continuing the country together has always been difficult, and it is more difficult to carry forward," says Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the International Crisis Group for the Horn of Africa.
Ethiopia is, after Nigeria, the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by the western countries.
The U.S. army and the intelligence service strongly support the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia, but only few African countries, if anything, will receive this much assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown fast.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, the capital of Addis Abeba has even a new farmhouse.
The streets of the cities are usually calm, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from the model country of democracy, and human rights organisations have been constantly reporting government repression policies, the opposition in the country is very limited and the dissidents are suppressed quickly.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may change.
"If the people are repressed, and they have no choice but to show their minds, it will break out," says Seyoum Teshome, who works as a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
"All youths show their minds.
A whole generation protested."
There are many topics of dissatisfaction, always from the use of land to the strangulation of the government coalition.
After extensively criticised elections last year, the governing party and its allies received the last place previously belonging to the opposition, as a result they now rule over the entire Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising at the Eritrea border, where the rising situation in June required hundreds of deaths.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit confusion and rearm.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has been underneath the surface is now extinct.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only over the past few years, the Ethiopians have been able to communicate in social media, when cheaper smartphones became common and access to the Internet improved.
Even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many are allowed to access the Internet via media servers that secret their locations.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was the way they called people to protests.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest populations in Ethiopia, oroms and amhars.
Oroms and amhars aren't natural allies.
The Amhars, mostly from the Christianites of Ethiopia, have long ruled the country's policies and business and exterminated oroms, most of which are Muslims and live in lower areas.
But this is also changing.
"Actuation is getting deeper and we're getting under the same parachute," says Mulatu Gemechu, director of the oromo.
The major demonstrations have just been in the oromo and amhara regions.
Many amharas and oroms experience that Ethiopia is unjustly controlled by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and, however, dominates the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause behind the trouble is Meles Zenaw's death.
Former Vice President Meles was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius that could see behind the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled to detect the first signs of dissatisfaction and to use ambassadors who compromised the relationships between the counterparties.
"The current government lacks this essential intuition," says the conflict investigator Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia Hailemariam Desalegn entered Meles' boots for almost unknown.
Unlike Meles, who was from the North Ethiopia region of Tigre, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he has no confidence in the security forces controlled by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear this means more bloodshed.
For the last time in Ethiopia, similar riots were experienced in 2005, when thousands of people showed their minds against elections, which, according to the analysts, first swept and then stole.
In post-election disturbation, many protestors were killed, although there were fewer deaths than in the previous months, and the unrest ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the Ethiopia leaders for remote infrastructure planning, such as a new spatial accommodation train, and significant progress in combating poverty.
But the inner grudge against the Government of Ethiopia has clearly not prevented the strength.
And the wrath is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in the city of Amhara, Gordar, protestors attacked companies owned by tigers, and the hate speech against tigers is becoming common in social media.
According to analysts, protests put the United States and other Western allies in a bad situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned, neighbouring Somalia, but the base has recently been closed, according to the United States.
At the same time as the West wishes to clearly support democracy, it does not want its ally already in the insecure region to collapse.
"This requires strict balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claims to be the founder of Obama Isis.
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to draw his words back in his last campaign, saying that he was not serious when he claimed several times this week, President Obamaa and Hillary Clinton, the terrorist group Isis as "basicists".
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side about the ability of the president to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters, who must try to defend their candidate in these stormy moments and explain comments that he might not have meant, are also in a challenging situation.
Trump presented the claim at the election meeting on Wednesday night and repeated the various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he said that the President and Mr Clinton had created Isisi.
But early Friday morning, Trump twitted and said that his claim was sarcasm.
Trump was full of his speech on the twitter from the day before, when he said he was very serious about his charges in several interviews.
When the radio broadcaster and Conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help the Trumps soften their claim by saying that Obamaha attempted to destroy Isisi, the Republican presidential candidate refused to withdraw his claim.
The latest review storm rose when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy when the support figures were lowered.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy speech in Michigan this week.
Friday, Trump was trying to get back to the subject again.
On Twitter, he warned me that Clinton's proposals would increase taxes, and that Clinton's speech was annoying.
Trump's been defending himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received extensive criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's e-mail. He later explained his comments by saying, "Of course, I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the limits of political speech and draws his words back if necessary.
"I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that raise responses to his supporters. He sees how the supporters react to messages, and "clarifies" in a way or depending on the other reactions," says the communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claim and knows that they are enough circulars to pass through different screens."
Instead of softening his statements to the electoral audience, Trump has made his style even more shattering in recent days, as his support numbers have continued to fall.
A new opinion study by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Maristi published on Friday stated that the support of Trump is significantly lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is strictly even.
While Trump usually tries to avoid being sorry for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or failing to understand his sense of humor.
But after becoming more accurate in view of their presidential campaign, in the last months, the Trump jokes have put his loyal supporters in a embarrassing position, where they have to publicly defend the comments of Trump, whatever provocative they are.
One of the most important supporters of Trump, former Mayor of New York Rudolph W. Giuliani, was strongly defending the president during the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I regard his words as a justified, political speech," answered Giuliani when asked him if Trump was true when he claimed that Obama and Hillary Clinton were founded by Isisi.
"It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organisation called by Obama incorrectly "the team of the lower series" and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most Republicans representing the mainstream are trying to claim that the Obama regime, where Hillary Clinton was a foreign minister, allowed Isisi to continue its efforts when it did not handle the situation in the Middle East with determination.
Before Friday’s elections in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter, where he blamed them for his talks and discriminating attitude toward him.
He mocked the "unworthy and pathetic" television commentators who try to find out about him, but he said that it could not succeed.
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump’s explanation and said that it would only show more clearly that he was not fit as President.
Due to an excessive increase in rent, the caffeine that stopped opening in Greenpoint
Verb Café was a bit of an explosive coffee shop in Williamsburg, where only cash was made and there was no Wi-Fi, but he offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafeteria was expelled from its street yard at Bedford Avenue when the rent was unreasonable.
Verb Cafe's place in the summer of 2014 was Soap Cherie selling soaps in the form of cupcakes.
The locals consider this under mid-classification to avoid the loss of a coffee shop.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York changes, I know, yes, but I can't believe that the CBGB Club is no longer there, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is no longer the same, there's a new one.
Last November, Verb Café opened a new cafe to Greenpoint, just a fair kilometer north of its original location.
In the new Verb cafe there is a Wi-Fi and there you can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still indisputable.
Coffee is still good, too.
The owner and head of the new Verb coffee shop is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term worker in the old cafeteria.
He began in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When one customer offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, maintained many things.
Verb space bagels from the same supplier as before and use the same espresso model.
In addition, it re-established even the lamps of the old Verb.
Rodriguez says, however, he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
There are pecon-cane eggs and sandwiches available and corrosive and brushed onion rings.
There's also dark skins on the list.
There is no more beer from the coffee, but instead, fresh fruit juices.
After having held the coffee shop for nine months, Rodriguez says that he noticed that the old standard customers began to run in a constant flow in Verb.
"After many of our old clients were expelled from Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently attended the cafeteria on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and visited Verb regularly.
After his change to Greenpoint, he took a walk back then to Verbi, who was still in Williamsburg.
When Verb closed, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even if that Sunday he took a chai offer instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also a listing news.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, came to Verb loyally since 2003.
She used to go to the coffee shop before work, and she ordered the same thing without exception.
"I walked into the cafe every day over seven hours, like a machine, and there they already prepared my butterbage with all fillings," she says.
Image: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products on his menu.
Today, Rosenthal still has its standard product, but sometimes he varies from bagels to bacon, eggs and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have to regret the fact that the soap shop took the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to prepare a special seal for making the coffee of Verb’s own.
Rodriguez says, "We can still take the offer."
The Polish traditionally residents of Greenpoint have also welcomed the cafeteria with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for the right place to welcome his new neighbors.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold-grown coffee in the cafe.
Café may also be extended to the building next door.
However, many customers have enough to get their old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart broke when the cafe was closed.
When the new place was opened, and I ordered coffee there, it felt like it was home, says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of a coffee shop."
A Great Legend Food in a New Work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, soon after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in his office room in the White House for lunch.
President Roosevelt, known as the culinary clerk, was fond of the luxurious foods of the Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the glove bearer and the Maryland turtles.
On that day his menu was more modest: the devil’s eggs (deviled eggs) in tomato sauce, potato mud and dessert of the prune.
"It was an expression of culinary solidarity for people suffering," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe adds: "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights works as a food historian.
The latest book of Coe, called Chop Suey, tells about the Chinese kitchen in America, while the latest book of Ziegelman, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of the floorhouse in Lower East Side.
Their new joint work is A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, which describes the history of American food in the great lama season of the 1930s.
The Paris showed its own culinary solidarity when concluding a meeting with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar near Flatiro's cloud composer, and was opened in the same year as the big stock decay took place, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a sandwich with cream cheese and olives and a 57-year-old Coe in turn for turkey, potato moustaches and mixed vegetables.
When the supplier ordered meat cream, the couple said it was suitable for the debate on a very large period of depression.
"The worries were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"Mans ate peanut muffins, liver murmurs, and papaver.
They were made of substances that were cheap and suffice.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they're enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe is grieved.
"It must have been weighed in the stomach like lead," he says.
Before the great bed years, the American food table, especially in the countryside, worked with the Buffet principle "eat as much as you want".
Women made food for agricultural workers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner, they served refractory pies.
It was the Americans who had sent food to the hungry Europeans during the First World War. A Square Meal is the chronic ways the people survived when the overwhelmingness suddenly had to be abandoned.
"This was a time when food became a central and annoying subject of Americans," says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The same stressful was the new advantageous diet: According to Zeigelman, mysterious dishes like vinegars and batteries became headfood, and the batteries were said to be a "sufficient means of utilizing food stars," because the cooks could not cover such attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
The meat that had been the most important part of American meals for every year became the luxuriously used luxuries.
Weird mixtures were tested with the most important calories and nutritional values and not a taste or even a healthy kitchen log.
In carrying out a study for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared oven leafs filled with peanut waxes used as a bulb meal.
"It didn't get popular at the dinner table," says Coe, "what?
Ziegelman adds: "It was unrealistic.
The peanut butter and the oven onions don't fit at all.
This was characterised by many household receptors."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who was head of the Federal Household Agency from 1923 to 1943, guided the food habits of the citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
In newspapers and magazines, they published recipes and articles and encouraged women to be careful budget holders and respond to the challenge of making some splendid dishes like carrots.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical flavors.
Specially delicious are the reports of the reaction of the government leadership to its hungry citizens, such as the "give me to eat cake" position by President Herbert Hoover.
While he publicly praised his child’s simple food on an iowal farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a delicate gentleman who had become.
"He liked a continental European kitchen, like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate near in the golden coat room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely distracted from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to show an example in his stomach.
As the book says, as Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the foods served in the White House were not only the boringest, but also the most poorly prepared food in Washington."
Many of the lama-time foods were rejected as soon as the land returned to its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuity of tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and nutrition and how science has been applied to cooking.
The couple reports when writing the book that they began to understand better the eating habits of Zeigelman’s mother, for example, why she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," say Coe.
"Mans even began to get sick of his food," recalls Zeigelman.
"One time, first of the windshields."
After emptying the main dishes at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Zeigelman and Coe brought up the sprinkler food they had prepared at home, the same thing that President Roosevelt ate in their lunch.
"It's called pneumonia wax," says Zeigelman and adds that it was a common trick to give a seeming name to modest receptors.
There was no cream wax, only puffs, little flour, sugar, water and cannabis.
We reluctantly drowned our spoon into a thick brown bride.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe's done the second time and the third time.
"German nuts would make it better," Coe says to his wife, sounds like a positive budget manager.
Full compensation to Gilead for adjudicial fees for the patent titration of hepatitis C with Merck
The United States Regional Court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive full compensation for the legal fees it incurred with Merck & Co Inc on the patent for hepatitis C.
In June, Gilead was exempted from the compensation of $200 million for the breach of two Merck patents in connection with the success medicines called Sovaldi and Harvoni. The US judge noted that Merck committed infringements, including the misconduct of the wrong whale and other unethical practices.
On Thursday's application, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the United States Regional Court said that Gilead was entitled to be exempted from the legal fees it suffered from defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, who controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can treat over 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case runs until 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other and demands private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance in Gilead medicines.
The U.S. armies have conquered the city of Manbiji from Isis
The U.S. armies have been captured in northern Syria by the city of Manjib near the Turkish border, when the last extremists of Isisi have left the city, says the force mediator.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group now shattered the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
A representative of the Manbiji Military Council of SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2 000 hostages were released by Isisi fighters.
"The city is now under our control, but we are still carrying out search operations," Darwish said.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal tax
On Friday, Hillary Clinton, the presidential candidate of the Democrats, published his 2015 tax declaration, showing that his and his husband's income at that time was $10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate they paid for was 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to the charity organizations, mostly to the Clinton Foundation Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $ 5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, former minister of Foreign Affairs, announced that he earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster's library, which covered his office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton published 10-year tax declarations.
The actual federal tax rate they paid was 20,3 in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to show models for economic transparency," says Jennifer Palmier, Clinton's campaign assistant, in a newsletter.
The opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax information.
According to practice, US presidential candidates have always disclosed their tax information, even if they are not required by the law.
The New Yorker businessman Trump and his lawyer have called on the tax administration to check and say it is why Trump has not published his income information.
"The shipment is your" twitter, Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, referring to the tax information of a democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump's Special Right Assistant Michael Cohen told CNN that he wouldn't let Trump publish his tax data until the audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to publicise information raises questions about Trump's own capital, his support for charity, his business relations and many other links, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken this question and published a video online on Friday, where he highlights the prominent Republicans who patrate the Trumps to publish their tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the matter in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every president's candidate has been doing for decades, not his public tax declarations," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to the Politico web magazine, Trump did not pay taxes at all or only a little for two in the 1990s, and the New York Times business colonist quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be similar.
Federal tax rates have become a key issue for the presidential elections.
According to the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Clinton has supported a rule designated to ensure that more than a million dollars a year deserve a tax of at least 30%.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, who is the head office of the Berkshire Hathaway multi-purpose company, challenged Trump's meeting, where both of them would reveal their tax information.
Buffet tells us that he has also been subjected to the tax administration's audit and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax notifications until 2007.
Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua in the state of New York, paid on average 32 per cent of the real federal tax from 2007 to 2014, and their actual combined tax rate paid by them was about 40,5 per cent.
Clinton's 2015 tax declaration shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income had salary deposits.
Their capital investment was a low-stage index investment fund, and the Clintons reported the amount of dividends and interest income of $100,000.

Chili powder-filled terry condoms in support of elephant protection in Tanzania
Nature protectors in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep the elephants away from human housing — elephants are avoided by throwing condoms filled with chili powder toward them.
Keino has proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had come up a few years ago, has, together with the United States National Conservacy, started a campaign to teach the volunteers of the villages of northern Tanzania how people can protect their homes and elephants without harming them.
A while ago, spears were used for elephants.
Friday is the day of the world's elephant, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"In the process we have developed, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can be confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," says Damian Bell, the Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation in his information.
First, the intrusive elephant is shaded by showing a flashlight and playing a horn.
If this doesn't work, we'll throw it in the so-called Chili Milk.
Mixed chili powder from soil is placed in a condom together with a slurry, then the head of the condom is circulated so that only the ignition wire is excluded.
When the ignition wire is fired, the condom explodes and spreads into the air a fine chili powder cloud.
Usually one spicy cloud is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last way is a throw that shoots in the air of a fireworks known as a Roman candle and produces a loud and clear explosion.
The Jewish film director criticizes the Berlin Hotel on the removal of the Israeli direction of the Arab 's 'Erasmus' – RT News
The French, judith film director, created a media stream after revealing that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel did not mention the Israeli guide number in his country number list. The hotel employee called to ask the Arabic customers for the 'eatings'.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the holocaust's Shoah document, frustrated against the Berliner Kempinski Bristol Hotel by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
On his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the book of directions offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which the room can be called directly.
"How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it had not existed?"
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through a separate call centre.
The film director asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the reception officer's answer shocked him.
The reception officer said that the removal of Israel from the list was "a carefully considered decision by the management of the Campinski Hotels".
The reason behind the operation was even more shocked by the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demand that Israel's guideline be removed."
The Israeli ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, said the case was a "great shame".
"The death will shock and shock all of us.
It's a big shame.
And the more shameless it is, considering that we are in Germany and that this is just this hotel chain.
There's no need for any more explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the Ambassador.
The case caused quite a counteract on the network, which called it a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving up the alleged demands of Arabic customers.
In a publication, the location of the hotel was mentioned near the synagogue on the Kurfurstendamm street.
Der Spiegel writes about the hotel's allegations quickly, called what happened a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The order to leave Israel from the list of directions was never given," writes Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel representative.
It adds that the reference number has subsequently been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubbers in the demonstration of Brazilian students.
Students joined the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to show their minds against the reforms of the government’s public education system.
The police used the protesters against tear gas and rubber shots.
Mellacing began when law enforcement authorities tried to dismantle the students, resulting in the police’s use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students, who wanted to show their dismay to the government’s plans, participated in the demonstration.
Governor Geraldo Alckmin of Sao Paulo has proposed a savings measure involving nearly 100 public schools and 300 000 students are placed in new schools.
Some demonstrators made graffiti on walls where they temporarily objected to Michel Temer, the President's office.
The protest of students took place only a few days after the streets were fulfilled from the dissolutioned president Dilma Roussef who supported the protesters during the vote of the country's Senate on this issue.
Trade between Russia and Iran has grown by 71% – RT Business
After the exit of sanctions, the annual trade exchange between Moscow and Teheran has increased by 70.9 per cent, says the Russian Ambassador of Iran, Levan Dzhagarya.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were repealed.
"Brussels continue existing relations with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further development of trade is, of course, one of the priorities of cooperation between countries," says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016 trade exchanges between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to EUR 856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5% to 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 per cent to USD 158 million.
The trade was accelerated by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record of Iranianists to travel to Russia this year.
" Last year, the Russian foreign representation in Iran granted some 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was for the first time among the first 20 countries, whose citizens travelled in Russia.
And it is not too bold to say that the record of Iranian tourists traveling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd which have kept the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he says.
Scotch Callum Skinner would be in the end of the British winner of bike gold
The Scottish Callum Skinner, in the men's teamprint, was renowned by Rio's velodrom last night when the British triangle defended the 2012 earned championship in London.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgowine was in an anchor role he inherited from his countryman Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made a legend proud when he praised the goal and captured the victory from the New Zealand team pre-favored.
Britain took a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won his fifth Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after they were only placed on the sixth of the World Railway Tour in London, even though Hoy had left his competition career later.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the first leader Jamie Staff.
Hindes came up just at the right time.
Hoy’s decision to end the race also left the hole Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill in.
The Scottish Skinner was the man in whom British coaches believed and where they saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Hoy and the winner of the championship four years ago Kenny and Skinner made the Olympic performance at the time, but in the first round, New Zealand was faster.
And the British triangle won gold in a duel.
Hindes was very behind the tour, but Kenny was working on the team's leading position, which Skinner kept.
A large part of the change was the change in the strategy, so Hindes drove to slow the speed by a larger switch, which enabled Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the speed.
Hoy followed as the BBC commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' view when they entered the awards.
Glasgowinen 23-year-old Skinner says, "I'm flattered by the parallel.
I'm just trying to do my best, and I'm trying to succeed.
We've done a Olympiad at the final and won world champions.
It was amazing.
There's no better way to win it."
After gaining in London 2012, Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted to fall on the track on purpose because of a bad departure.
Later, he canceled his word, and the British competitors had no appeal.
This time, the sovereign victory had no such problems.
Hindes says: "The sensation was like in London, all the UK flags flew in the view.
Our team was united in the last three months.
We've lost so many world fairs that the victory in the Olympics seems great."
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten railways in Beijing and London.
If this is a meter of progress in the last five months, we will face a successful five-day velodrom.
As Kenny has shown his ability, it is not impossible to imagine that he repeats Hoy’s achievements and wins three Olympic Golds in the Olympics.
This would mean an account of six gold militars and one silver mitt for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyt and was also born on March 23 (the magical date of British sport, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister’s birthday).
That would be the same medal support as Hoy.
Kenny's next competing for a sprint that starts today and settles in three days.
The Boltonian 28-year-old Kenny says, "I can only be happy about this at this moment.
The team race is always the best.
You'll enjoy the victory with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must have the knight's value."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doul were the fastest in four men's team drive.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record made in London 2012 and won gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and final ( 11:42 p.m.) will be competing today on the second day of the competition, and the focus of attention will certainly be on Wiggins.
He had a fight with competition agents yesterday before time when the agents invited him to measure his length.
In a similar competition for women that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached World Representation Period 4:13.260.
The British team can now rely on the responsibility of its mighty motorcycle team for the mid-stage of the Olympics and bringing a number of medals to the country.
After the very extraordinary evidence of the full leadership in Beijing and London, the expectations ahead of Rio have been underestimated.
The background has been the dramas, the least not the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the middle of the allegations of sexism and bullying, and the end of the competitions of big sportsmen such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on the first night on the velodrom show that the legendary reputation of the UK is rising to the top at the perfect moment again.
The future of Portland mergers at risk due to the end of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium plant in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at risk when the power company that operates electricity to the melting plant reported that one of the owners of the factory is dismantling the supply contract and it is expected that all delivery contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the Victorian Government's decision earlier this year not to continue the aid for the operation of the factory.
Fixed aid for 20 years will cease in November.
There is a risk of losing up to 2,000 jobs from the Alcoa Portland factory.
As a result of the relocation, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect may continue to increase, as the melting plant consumes about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melt, which led to the closing of Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa Portland's melting plant loses money and is in danger of having to close the door.
The measures correspond to the speculation of the future of the plant for years, which was first caused by a strong Australian dollar and the recent production price of the factory.
AGL, which provides electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley to the large aluminium plant, says that he expects the other three owners of the melting plant to cease their contract.
The majority of the company is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina. The Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Maruben Corp own minority shares in the factory.
AGL states that it is waiting for the Portland production plant to remain in operation, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue.
AGL states that the agreements are so-called ‘protection agreements’, which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The term of resignation of contracts shall be 12 months, which will end in 2017.
"For this reason, AGL expects the contracts to produce revenues in the financial year 2017," says the power plant.
The potential effects on AGL from the financial year 2018 are currently limited by the strong future market prospects for electricity wholesale prices.
AGL already states that it has reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million as a "preference for the termination of contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts "does not affect Alcoa ... the ability to keep the melting facility in operation or secure the supply of electricity to the melter".
The American company stated that it had concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was to enter into force from November of this year, even though it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
Due to the weak economic situation in the sector, the analysts have been cautious of their estimates, both from a melting plant in Portland, Victoria, and from a tomago factory near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, Operational Director of AGL, said in his speech to analysts earlier week that Portland uses around 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago of about 900 megawatts at annual level.
"If these plants leave the market, this means a significant decline in demand in the electricity market.
It would not be good news for us as a producer," says Mikkelsen.
Cardassian TV TV star Kendall, September Vogue cover girl
The model of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20 pose in the famous September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, an Advertising of Estee Lauder and performing in Milan, Paris and New York fashions, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
"Looking at a room full of my loved ones, made me tears," Kendall wrote.
The publication of the cover was followed by a strange (or perhaps only the Kardashians-serie?), a handwritten video with all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar alarms Rob and Caitlyn and all the favorite father, the Kardashians programme producer, Ryan Seacrest), showing that they forgot their sister's cover. The video ends in classical translation: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
It's cliché and it's used for almost all of the birthday periods of the axes (Seacrest says: "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" as sincerely as children's morning TV drawings), but Kris had to get his other daughters in some way involved in this publicity.
Because the appearance of Vogue in the September issue is undoubtedly a new Cardassian era.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have arrived before Vogue (when she appeared in Vogue's cover together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is very different.
September is Vogue's most sold publication in the year.
A number resembles a large number of advertisers with its thickness more than a fashion page (the fashion page Fashion decreased that there were 615 pages of advertising on the 832 page of last year’s guide).
The publication of the Pentecost of September is expected so intensely that in the previous two years, the pictures of the magazine have already been published before official announcement.
Previously on the September cover models, including Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years there have been more famous models on the cover than models that are famous.
The Oscar winner and the Dior Advertising tumor Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later the honor received from Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for his generation, and even if he reads as a group of celebrities that work in the model, he is quite good company.
These celebrities are not related to well-known people, true TV stars or modern children who know how to do a good Snapchat video (but Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called gifted women who succeed in the entertainment industry over others.
Beyonce has one of the strongest years of her career last year when she published her Lemonade album.
Of course, not all are happy about Jenner’s success.
Because of his true TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the Victoria's Secret original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "narts".
These emotions have rebursed when the news of Jenner’s appearance on Vogue cover came out.
However, it seems irrelevant to continue squeezing of dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner is a cover image model for Vogue's September number.
He's a super model, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking on Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
He's a commercial breed of Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid applications.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who he shot to the LOVE.
And in his free time, he's on the real TV, maybe just a way to meet his sister and her kids.
Legal aid centres turn away 160 000 people per year
More than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable countries will be withdrawn from legal aid centres each year, and the sector will prepare for the effects of further cuts of appropriations on centres already operating at the extreme borders.
In the state of Queensland, three of the five applicants for legal aid and legal services are being rejected, most of them are older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified exclusions and similar injustices against those who fight without resources.
Public legal aid services, which have already been overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
Since June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing more 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Public Assistance Centre, reports that, according to the latest calculation report drawn up by the National Organisation of Legal Assistance Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away from the centres each year.
If the federal government doesn't faint, Farrell says it's just gonna get worse.
"Queensland's public law aid centres are constantly under-funded, which means that thousands of people will be turned away when they seek the necessary services," says Farrell.
"Everyone who leaves out of violent relations, people who are under uncontrollable and crippled debt burden, divorced families, unduly redundant workers – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The Federal Government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the weakest in Queensland will have to cope with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to be immediately handed over these financial cuts so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to take into account the needs of public law aid centres and their customers, and the government of Palaszczuki must invest in this important work."
An action against Donald Trump's campaign to threaten the employee with a gun was raised.
New York: A complaint was raised against Donald Trump's campaign when no action was assumed to be taken after the head of the campaign had been informed that the leader of the campaign in North Carolina had threatened a worker with a gun during their driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in a case that Vincent Bordin, former programme trainer of the state campaign, raised on Wednesday at the state court in Charlotte.
He says that he had waited months for the situation to be handled internally in the campaign before he realized, according to his own words, that this would not happen.
In his claim, Earl Phillip, the campaign leader, "he put a pistol out, put his right finger on the trigger and pushed the peak into Vincent's kneelight".
After the complaint was made to the local and regional head of the campaign, Bordin found that at least four other persons had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
" Even if the gun wouldn't be fired, it'll cause damage," says Bordini when he filed.
The application will only come two days after the Republican presidential candidate has caused general rage in saying to the crowds in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second paragraph" – which are regarded as armed and armed – can take action if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, wins the election and will be able to choose the judges.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media removed his word from the context and Trump did not encourage violence.
In its action against the campaign, he demands compensation for the indifferent and Phillip for extortion, assault and mental suffering caused by the campaign.
Hope Hicks, the mediator of Trump, did not respond immediately to the message in which he was asked for a comment.
Despite the attempts, Phillip wasn't targeted.
Charlotte's local news office, WCCB, told me that Phillip just left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to the call request submitted to Phillip’s Innovative Consulting Service.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordin v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revitalises the economy and creates well-being – not only in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For myself, this was the thing that was most interested in Heathrow, and as in the Olympics of London 2012, we had a huge effort to benefit all of our nation and all of our regions.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only for local communities, we create 10,000 new apprentices and 40 000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the neighbouring areas of the airport.
As in the London Olympics 2012, there are always people who believe that the expansion of Heathrow is a too big challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I was told that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will be in a embarrassing situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow too.
The victorious obstacles will always be met, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many instead of few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and increase the economy by 211 billion pounds, bringing skills and employment both to the airport's environment and to the United Kingdom as a whole.
We have a mighty task force on Heathrow, which has carried out in time and remains in the budget a 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment programme, which included the T5-terminal, which has been voted for the best flight terminal of the year in two consecutive years, and the T2-terminal, which was built in the middle of two of the world's most busy runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, supported by a private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that this will also be the extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for the expansion of Heathrow, so that we can guarantee our trade in the future and create knowledge and employment, for which Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Heathrow Government and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Advertisement Cat-Maus games
The efforts of companies who earn their money from online advertising to mislead advertising software have changed into cat-mouth games, says one company producing preventive programmes.
Thursday, only two days after Facebook had announced its website to prevent advertising prevention programs, Adblock Plus published a blog writing where it told us that users can update their preventive software filters and thus again prevent Community service advertising.
On Tuesday Facebook announced that it would be difficult to identify the sections of advertising advertising to change the code of advertising on its desktop website.
But now Adblock tells me he's cleared out the new codes.
Adblock's informant Ben Williams wrote in a blog paper that "this balling between the open source's advertising barrier community and the delusionists has been running since the anti-advertent advertising" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon be doing its own repair business again.
The fact that the world's largest social media enterprise has participated in the fight is a strong indication of the great concern of advertising engaging in the sector.
Worldwide estimated 200 million people are using advertising prevention programmes, reports a study carried out by Pagefair and Adobe last year. This figure has been nearly fourfolded since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users on mobile devices daily, and the share of mobile advertising is already 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to invest in misleading advertising prevention programmes in its desktop application, as the reporter considers that mobile advertising prevention programmes do not work in Facebook's mobile applications and Instagram.
The revenues from Desktop advertising are still sufficiently high, so Facebook considered the investment to be worthwhile.
On Tuesday Facebook also announced how to update the user settings advertising tool so that users can control more about how advertising is targeted to them.
Thursday, Facebook criticizes Adblock's new filters, as it also prevents the appearance of some ordinary Facebook writings.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," said the Facebook informant in his e-mail.
"The advertising prevention programmes are clumsy and inefficient, and that is why we have invested in developing user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of advertising themselves."
A woman committed suicide by leaving her cars under the Swiss highway.
The victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway.
The police are asking for witness assistance on the highway for an accident in the first few hours on Thursday, where a woman accident was intentionally left under more cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in Vaud's office near Morges shortly after midnight.
She did her desperate act by lying on the dark road, and more cars hit her, says Vaud’s police report.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and she was clearly trying to commit suicide, and among the overrun cars, there was also a truck.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the automobiles involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some of them are still unidentified.
Attorney Gilles Hofstetter, in Le Tribune de Genève, reports that criminal investigations have been launched, which is a logical step in such a situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the charges are raised against the automobiles involved in the accident.
"Did the collision be impossible?
It's gonna be settled by the prosecutor," says Hofstetter.
During the last five years, two similar cases have been carried out which are not considered responsible for automobiles.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, a person walked in the dark on the highway and the court decided that the drivers cannot expect to strike their pedestrians on a motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police authority was released from the prosecution that had been raised from the death expectation after he hit a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The court heard that the 22 - year - old victim had had had had a lot of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The Court held that the conduct of a police officer, who was responding to an emergency call, was justified and a man of the size of the road was a "experienced and unpredictable situation".
On Thursday, all known people are asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model for examining Venus' past with the same tools and algorithms as those used by climate researchers.
The model was intended to determine whether the conditions in Venus have sometimes been similar to those on earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless, and its gas circle consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to previous researchers, the slow rotation rate of Venus is explained in its thick gas circle.
However, the latest simulation suggests that Venus has had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it has still slowly rotated.
The model was also used to identify the early Venus surface formation.
There may have been more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been sufficient water and geographical variations to maintain life and prevent rapid disappearance.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent lower.
"In the GISS modelling, Venus rotates slowly, and the sun's sun is almost two months at a time," says the GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like a parachute and protects the surface largely for the heat of the sun.
As a result, the average temperatures of the climate are even a few degrees lower than the current temperatures of the earth.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary researchers about its development.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans disappeared, and the ultraviolet light burned steamed water.
When watery was chased out into space, only a thick carbon gas ring and a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus, as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus outlook model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy's giving up his place as Avalanche coach.
Patrick Roy resigned his duties on Thursday as Coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as the Vice-Chairman of the hockey activities of the Society, increasing the lack of influence on the team’s decision making.
The Vice-President/CEO of Colorado, Joe Sakic, confirmed the news and announced that the company immediately began to seek a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have performed my mission as the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as the Vice-Chairman of the hockey activities of the Society with intense, passion and determination," says Roy, a 50-year-old, in his communication.
"I have been thinking long and intently during the summer how I can improve the team, give it the depth that it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Vice-President of the Coach and the Society’s hockey activities must be fully in line with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions affecting the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his commitment to the team.
"Patrick told me his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the good for the future."
The Jack Adams Award Prize was awarded to Roy as the best trainer of the league from his first period in 2013 to 2014 as Avalanche’s principal coach.
Under his leadership, the company reached 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost the Minnesota in drop games and has not reached the extension in the past two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points during the period 2015-2016 and remained five points away from Minnesota Wild when playing another Wild Card place at the western conference.
In his career, the Hall of Fame sailor Roy won four Stanley Cups – two in the line of Montreal Canadiens and two in the Avalanche rows.
The North Sea oil workers start negotiations and interrupt the strike
The main consultants say that the oil workers in the North Sea will be interrupted when all parties participate in the new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, which provides oilfield services, has been held in the North Sea with drilling trucks under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties, 'Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to reopen the process in order to resolve the dispute'.
From the beginning of next week, we will be attending a number of day-to-day meetings that deal with the problems of fresh aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activities, according to them, first for more than 25 years, as a protest against possible 30% wage cuts.
Due to negative market pressure, the Wood Group cuts around 9% of the tariffs of its contractors in the North Sea this year.
The company's tariff reduction is based on a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in the countries in 20114.
According to the company, the additional cuts will give it the space necessary to cope with the downturn of the market.
Shell, on its behalf, has disembarked thousands of employees and announced their plans to leave oil and gas in up to 10 countries, thereby endeavouring to intensify its activities after its megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
The lower prices and the economic situation of crude oil, as a result of the British decision to leave the European Union in June, create pressure on energy companies.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member of Parliament, met working leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work in the North Sea for a whole generation.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the economy of the region.
"In the North Sea and in the whole country we need a economy that has advantages for many people and not just for few," says Anderson.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to be using less than € 1.4 billion in 2016, with some $7 billion spent on them over the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Plejad Star Force
The latest task of the Kepler space telescope has been to measure the speed of the stars, which has helped the astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the rotation rates of stars belonging to the Plejadian astronomer.
On the basis of new information, astronomers are able to find out why the stars of the same constellation rotate at different speeds and how circular times are linked to the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other astronomers, we learn more about the relationship between weight and age and even the history of the solar system," says Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre at the University of Caltech in Pasadena.
The Plejadians are located 445 light years from the Earth.
Many of the stars have been born about 125 million years ago, meaning that they are just reaching their adult age.
They're running faster than ever at the moment.
As the speed of the rotation is high, large amounts of astronomer stars are dissolved.
These winds have a brake effect on the stars when they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of every star by following the time between the appearance of identifiable star spots (which correspond to sunlights).
The latest listing speed data indicate that larger stars are slower than smaller.
Rebull compares stars to dancers — the larger are slower than the smaller.
"We see the "dancing" of the Plejadians that slowly spinners are typically larger, while the fastest spinners are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since the Plejadians are so close, it operates as an ideal space laboratory to compare the stars’ properties with the speeds of rotation.
"Plejad's Star Force offers a supportpillar for the theoretical models for the rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want a lot more information on how, when and why stars slow their spinning speed and stop their "dancing".
Mr Rebull to his colleagues presents his latest analysis of Pleija's spinning rates in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
