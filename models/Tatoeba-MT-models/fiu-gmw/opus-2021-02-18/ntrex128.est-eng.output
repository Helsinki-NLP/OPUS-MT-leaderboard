The members of the Welsh National Assembly fear that they look like the Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly are surprised by the recommendation to convert their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, or a member of the Wales Parliament).
The topic has begun to transform the name of the National Assembly into the Wales Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridiculousisation.
One member of the National Assembly of Labour said that his groupmates are concerned because it rhymes with the words “Twp and Pwp”.
To explain to the readers outside Wales: the term daft means nakák and pwp means poop.
A member of the board said that the whole group as a whole “is not happy” and has proposed other names.
A member of the Wales Conservative Party said that his group is viewing the change of name “acceptively” but noted that the word “Muppet” is very similar to the word “Muppet”.
To explain: in the sense of the code, the expression of the letter w is similar to that of the Yorkshire English u.
The National Assembly Committee, which currently drafts a legislative proposal on the change of names, said: “The final decision on all the names to which members of the National Assembly are invited will, of course, be taken by the members themselves.”
The Law of the Wales Government of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public survey on the names of proposals, which broadly supports the idea of calling the National Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
As regards the title of members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name ‘Wales Parliament’, or WMPs’, but the public poll participants favoured the most variant ‘MWP’.
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching an agreement may be a challenge to President Elin Jones, who should submit a legislative proposal on changes in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act also covers other changes to the principles of work of the National Assembly, including the rules on the withdrawal of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of members of the National Assembly remains to the members in the debate on the legislation itself.
Macedonians organise referendums on changes to the name of the country
On Sunday, the voters will vote to rename their country as the "Republic of North Macedonia".
A referendum will be organised with a view to addressing decades of disputes with a neighbouring country with its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long been claiming that the name of his northern neighbour represents the requirement for this territory and has repeatedly objected to the candidates for EU and NATO membership.
Mr Ivanov, President of Macedonia against the referendum on nominations, has said that he intends to ignore the vote.
However, the people who voted for the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, argue that the change in name is only the price that the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Saint Martin's watches are silent because Harlem's churches are in trouble
“ Older people with whom I have spoken have said that there was a bar and a church on every corner in the past, ” said Mr Adams.
"No one is either."
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“ People today communicate differently, ” he said.
“ Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhood where people stay daily.”
However, as regards churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be sufficient for as long as the leaders hope, and “they will be back in the beginning, earlier or later. ”
Adams added that churches can be replaced by apartment houses full of people who do not provide assistance to the rest of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority who buy apartments in these buildings are white, ” he added, “who therefore speed up the day when all these churches close their doors because it is unlikely that the majority of people living here will become members of their churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolitan – Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930 ’ s.
The black congregation, who had so far worshiped God, took over the property right of the building.
The African congregation of the St. Martin Church was ranked by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led Harlem’s main shopping street against 125th Street shoppers to a boycot when they refused to hire or promote black people.
In the fire of 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when the members of the Father Johnson congregation planned the rebuilding of the building, they used a carillion, or a clock game.
Father Johnson’s son and successor in St Martin’s Church, Reverend David Johnson, called the Karilion proudly “the clocks of the poor. ”
In July, however, the expert who played the Karijolon gave it another name: “Cultural Value” and “a unindependable historical instrument”.
Expert Tiffany from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world's first carillion, played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued 18 years ago to play a bigger carillion in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
The story of architects and contractors played in St. Martin's church in recent months, some of whom have been involved by the secular leaders of the church, others by the bishop.
In July, the church’s presidency, or the congregation’s leading body of secular leaders, complained to the bishop, that the bishop ‘ attempts to transfer the costs ’, even though the presidency was not even involved in the hiring of architects and employees sent by the bishop.
Some members of the association complained about the poor transparency of the bishop’s actions.
In California, a 13-year-old shark was injured by a boy diving after a 13-year-old lobster.
According to the authorities, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. in Encinitas near Beacon's Beach.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends on Saturday morning for about a half an hour when he heard the boy's handcuffs and then swims with others to help him get out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially thought that the boy was exciting his delight in getting the lobster, but “the boy then realized that he was screaming, “I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
His entire rangbone was ripped,” described Hammel's vision when he arrived at the boy.
“ I called all of them to come out of the water: ‘ There is a shark in the water! ’, added Hammel.
A life-threatening boy was taken on a plane to Rady's children's hospital in San Diego.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown so far.
The Savior and Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was confirmed that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the injuries of the victim were located at the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas from Casablade to Swamini for 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles added that more than 135 shark species exist in the region, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury intends to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' chains by creating supermarket-like beauty-style intersections, where experts also work.
As part of the major invasion of the UK's market of 2.7 billion pounds of beauty, which continues to rise in the way of sales of fashion and home products, the wider line gaps of beauty products will be tested over the whole country in 11 shops and will be introduced in other shops next year, if they are successful.
It is invested in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to exploit the former space for televisions, microwaves and domestic goods.
Sainsbury's said that it intends to double its choice of beauty products up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw for the first time.
The existing product options L'Oreal, Maybelle and Burt's Bees are also given more space in brand areas such as currently in Boots stores.
The supermarket also brings back its make-up series Boutique, where most of the products are suitable for vegan because young buyers demand more and more.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, a retailer of parfums is experimenting with a single sales licence in two Sinsbury shops, the first one opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the other will be opened this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Buying online and switching to the daily purchase of small quantities of food from local food stores means that supermarkets need to try more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury, has said that sales sites are becoming more and more similar to supermarkets because the supermarket chain is trying to fight low-cost chains such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
In Sainsbury, Argos has put sales places in hundreds of shops. The same has been done with Habitats' shops, since Sainsbury bought both chains two years ago, which allegedly supported the sale of food goods and made acquisitions more profitable.
The former attempt of Supermarket to renew its beauty and treatment departments ended with failure.
Sainsbury tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended up sharing the revenues from the sale of pharmacy products in supermarkets.
A new strategy was developed after he sold his 281 sons in Sainsbury three years ago for 125 million pounds of Celesio, a whole Lloyds Pharmacy trading chain.
The strategy also plays its role in Lloyds, adding luxury leather care products to its four shops’ product range, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business manager in Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of the passages of our beauty products to improve the surrounding environment for customers.
We have also spent money on employees who have received special training, who are always willing to advise.
Our trademark choice meets every need. However, the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a competitive destination for beauty trade, which can change old shopping methods."
Peter Jones is furious because Holly Willoughby gave up a $11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left “unhappyly” when the TV broadcaster, Holly Willoughby, gave up a $11 million transaction in his lifestyle trade mark business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby lacks time for the brand of domestic goods and clothing for Truly.
A couple of business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop.
The head of the 37-year-old TV show, This Morning, reported his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den's star Peter Jones' anger by stepping out of their luxurious lifestyle brand in the last minute to focus on their new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The authors said that Jones was “marryful ” when the TV star girl admitted a tense meeting held on Tuesday at Marlows Buckinghamshire, the headquarters of the male business empire, that her new contracts worth 1.5 million pounds mean that she no longer had time to commit to the brand of home clothing and clothing.
The business has been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop and was considered to double the estimated assets of Willoughby's 11 million pounds.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain to a holiday home.
One source said: “Truly must have been Holly’s main preference.
It was supposed to secure his far-reaching future, so she thought she would deal with it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everything that was involved completely amazed.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to the placing on the market of a series of products.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of ready goods."
Experts believe that the departure of the TV programme "This Morning" leader, one of the most rewarded celebrities in Britain, can cost the company millions, because products with a choice of sofa batteries and candles and home cloths have been invested in a thin amount of money and can also be accompanied by a later marketing of the product.
This may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Cap in 2016. The 52-year-old Jones joined the trademark as Chairman in March.
Couples go on holidays together and Jones has a 40% share in the Baldwin telecommunications company.
Willoughby becomes a brand-general for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin's ITV TV series "I'm A Celebrity".
One of Jones' close sources said last night: “I don't want to comment on his business.”
It's a difficult conversation, "after what we fell in love with."
Trump was laughing at criticism that was directed at him in the news for a comment that some consider “for the president worthwhile” and excessively positive for the North Korean Head of State.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his depraved "New Anchor's voice":
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the resignation of North Korea from nuclear weapons.
But the negotiations on nuclear resignation have stopped.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean High Diplomat Ri Yong Ho said to the heads of the world at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea would not see the "reacting reaction" of the United States to the original disarmament ports of North Korea.
It noted that the USA would continue to have pressured the country further.
The point of trump's stimulating speech was much more cheerful.
“ North Korea and I are doing very well, ” he said.
“A war was about to begin with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we're fine."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to good results: the missile attempts have been completed, helped to release hostages, and is arranged to bring American servants' deposits into their homeland.
He also protected his unusual communication with Kim.
“It is very easy to be a spokesman, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside for access to this full-time stadium, it is better to have nearly 200 people here," said Trump, referring to the crowd standing in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake destroy the island of Indonesia, killing hundreds of people
In the eradication of the consequences of the earthquake in Lombok, non-governmental organisations abroad were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to be relocated, a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for international assistance, was not declared.
“That's why they have often made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, so the stories are a little complicated,” said Mrs Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization sets together a team to go to Palus, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the region.
The press representative of the National Destruction Office, Mr Sutopo, said that the authorities in Indonesia are assessing the situation in a request to decide whether international authorities are allowed to contribute to assistance.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has surprisingly little prepared for natural resources.
Although a shelter has been built in Aceh for the tsunami, they are not particularly common in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given about the tsunami, the apparent lack of the tsunami warning sirene was likely to increase the number of deaths.
Traveling between many islands in Indonesia is also quite a challenge in the best times.
Natural disasters make the logistics there even more complicated.
In Lombo, a hospital ship stopping to treat the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palus, but it takes at least three days to arrive at a new accident site.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesian fragmented infrastructure improvement a central part of his electoral campaign and has distributed money on roads and railways.
However, budget deficits pose a threat to Mr Joko's government, as there will be new elections next year.
Mr Joko is also pressured by the tensions in Indonesia among the kinds of people where the majority of Muslim communities have turned to a more obsolete form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes on the streets because of the battles between Christian and Muslim gangs using matchets, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge hits the violin gate against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool's loss in Chelsea's Premier League, violating the state at the 89th game in Stamford Bridge, on Saturday's game in London.
Sturridge received a feed from Xherdan Shaqir, about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate, when his team led 1 : 0.
He hit the ball left of himself before he hit it in a distance of the post.
The ball flew over the penitentiary and hit the right upper corner of the net.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get a position like this, get to the ball, and players like Shaq will give the ball as much as possible, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for myself," said Sturridge on LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come, I made one touch, and I gave him a long shot without thinking.”
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1 : 0 thanks to the gate hit by the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker feeded the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in this game before he turned around the middle field and hit Liverpool's side.
Kovac gave a quick feed in the middle field.
Then he created a beautiful air feed, leading Hazard to the sanctuary.
Hazard got through the defense and hit the ball on the left foot of Liverpool's player, Alisson Becker, in the way of a network located farther.
Liverpool plays with Naples in the Masters League subgroup on Wednesday at 15.00 p.m. Stadio San Paolol in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton at the UEFA Eurolii on Thursday at 15.00 p.m. in London.
Indonesian tsunami death rate increased to 832
In the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of deaths rose to 832, the state disaster agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped on Friday and 18-metres of giant waves brought to the wreckages of buildings collapsed because of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, buried under the collapsed buildings.
The police arrest a 32-year-old man after she was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was initiated after the woman's body was found this morning at Merseyside in Birkenhead.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 in the morning in Grayson Mews on John Street.
The police invites people who moved in the area to contact them who may have seen or heard something.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “Research is only about the beginning, but I would ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask all, in particular cab drivers, who may have recorded something, to contact us because they may have essential information for our investigation."
A police representative confirmed that a woman found in a building was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, a woman’s alleged friends asked questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway, and the police say they're informing her close relatives.
The cab driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was impressed when he heard the case.
The residents were told that their return to the house could take hours.
The police officer told one man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
One woman was in tears at the scene.
He kept saying, "That's terrible."
Two police buses were still locked in the area at 2:00 a.m., and the third was right there.
There were a number of police officers standing in this area and watching the apartment house.
Anyone with information about the event is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call at 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on the phone 0800 555 111, using the key tag 30 September log 247.
The shape of Parliament's Cromwell is the last memorial that is the cause of the "rewriting history" dispute
Elimination of this would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England in the Taliban style of the man's inhuman victors.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's recommendation as a foolishness and attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the debate on the destruction of images, it was impossible for Oliver Cromwell to remain intact in front of Westminster’s palace.
Cromwell didn't plunder the pictures in the British Civil War himself, nor told others to do it.
Maybe the false Cromwell man's ancestor Thomas was sacrificed for the actions of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent Cromwell presentation is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of the person who, in the opinion of a number of people, should still be respected."
Mr Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “A lot of people thought at the end of the 19th, rather than today, Cromwell's Parliament was the defender of external pressure and, in this case, of course, the kingship.
The fact that this is a precise reflection is an infinite historical dispute.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell clearly represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as the Lord Protector also deserve celebration and memorial."
A Chinese farmer was strangled to death with a killer pig.
According to the local media reports, a farmer attacked the man on the market in South-Edela-China.
A man who was identified only by his surname Yuan was found in the market in Liupanshu, near the suburb with a damaged artery, Guizhou, on Sunday, reported the South Chinese newspaper Morning Post.
The pigkeeper manufactured on 30 May 2005 in Xiningis Qinghai province in China to vaccinate pigs at its table.
He and his cousin had claimed to come from Yunnan next door on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his cousin dead and discovered that the sideline was open.
He said that the cheek was a big ox with a bloody mouth.
The examination of the court expert confirmed that a berth of 249,47 kilograms had been put to death by the farmer.
“ My cousin’s legs were all bloody and stunned, ” the newspaper Guiyang Evening News reported the words of the victim’s cousin Wu.
The security camera recorders showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday morning at 04:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found almost an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't belonged to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he wouldn't be able to attack anyone else until the police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market leaders are allegedly discussing the payment of compensation for the death of a man.
Although rarely, it has also been observed that pigs attack people.
In 2016, the pig attacked the woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294.83 kilograms pounded to the tractor of a farmer in Wales until the man’s wife scared the animal away.
In 2012, when one of Oregon’s farmers ate his own pigs, one of Manitoba’s farmers told CBC News that the pigs would normally not attack, but because of the taste of their blood, they could be stumbled.
“They are just gambling.
They're very curious marakrats whose purpose is not to be injured.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
Orkan Rosa’s winds bring large rains in the Southwest of the United States
It is predicted that the orcan Rosa is weakening, moving across the north coast of Mexico towards the cooler waters.
Yet, in the next few days, Rosa will bring flooding rains over to North Mexico and the Southwest of the United States.
On Sunday morning at 05:00 in the eastern coastal time, Rosa was classified as the first category of hurricane with the winds flying an hour, 619.59 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It's supposed to be Rosa moving north on Sunday.
In the meantime, there will be a low pressure zone on the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the tropical storm on Monday to the Baja California peninsula, it will direct deep tropical humidity towards the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa reaches Mexico, where it rains up to 25.4 centimeters [25.4 cm].
The tropical humidity reacting to the approaching low pressure will then cause massive rainfalles in the southwest of the country in the near future.
At times it causes dangerous storms, flood water and possible landings in the desert of rain that have fallen between 2,54 and 10,16 centimeters.
Deep tropical moisture causes a rise in rainfall between five and about seven and a half centimeter per hour, especially in the areas of South Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected that there will be a rainfall between 5.08 and 10.16 cm in certain southwestern regions of the United States, particularly in Arizona.
Ascensions are possible due to the dispersion of tropical rains with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Certainly, in the event of a tropical rainfall, there should be no walking in the desert.
Strong rain can cause canyons to turn into fast-flowing rivers and bunny storms to occasionally extinct wind attacks and floppy dust.
The approaching low pressure range sometimes leads to acute rainfalles in southern Californian coastal regions.
A total amount of rainfall that extends more than 1,27 centimeters and can cause smaller flood water and smooth roads.
This would be the first rain in the region during the rain season.
The tropical rainfalles that have been retired will be approaching Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning early, and the rain attacks will be widened on Monday night and Tuesday.
Strong rainfalles reach Four Corner on Tuesday and stay until Wednesday.
In October, the United States predicts large temperature fluctuations caused by the cooling of the Arctic, while temperatures remain high in tropical areas.
Sometimes it leads to major temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday weather is an excellent example of significant temperature variations in central America.
The temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) reach close to 20 degrees.
In the next few days, they'll try to collect themselves again in a long summer heat.
A large part of the central and eastern parts of the United States is expected to start warm October at a large range of temperatures, from the southern level to the north-east of the country.
In New York, 26,6 degrees of warmth are expected on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the east of the United States, there is a likelihood of high average temperatures in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was reviewed by over 20 million people.
More than 20 million people watched the appellant Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court on Thursday six television channels and, allegedly, the women who accused him of sexual violence in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
At the same time, a political blockage continued where broadcasters interrupted the presentation of conventional programmes to reflect the last-minute turns of Friday: Senator Arizona Jeff Flake prepared an agreement for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Commission that he's absolutely sure Kavanaugh grabbed her drunk and tried to rip her clothes off at high school.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate confession that he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen’s report, over 20.4 million people were likely to review the transfer on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other available channels, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has problems with the calculation of the number of people who view transfers in the authorities.
In comparison, it is about the same big audience as the final tournament of football or the sharing of Oscars.
Fox News Channel's opinion leaders, who have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all the networks on average at a session of 5.69 million audiences throughout the day, said Nielsen.
ABC 3.26 million with a viewer left the second place.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
Even after the trial, interest remained great.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After having made a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, the cameras of CNN and CBS hit the man on Friday morning, after he had been subjected to the protesters' revelation, trying to take the elevator to the Judicial Commission's meeting.
He stood his eyes down for a few minutes when he was accused and it was transferred directly to CNN.
“ I stand right here in front of you, ” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the state the truth?"
He was told: “You have power while so many women are completely incapacitated.”
Mr Flake said that his department issued a statement and added that before closing the elevator, he had more to say at the sitting of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Cable levy and broadcasting networks accounted for direct transmission several hours later when the Legal Commission had to vote to send Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate House for voting.
But Flake said he's only doing this to understand that the FBI is investigating the charges against the candidate next week, demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake persuaded a conversation with a friend of Democracy Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had an effect because it was obvious that the Republicans would not get Kavanaugh's votes without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump initiated a FBI investigation on Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May blames Brexit critics in the political game
In an interview with the Sunday Times, the Prime Minister blamed those who judge his plans for leaving the European Union, in a "political game" with the future of Great Britain and detrimental national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham in Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with a newspaper on the front of which Theresa May was with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pressured his attack on May's so-called Brexit's curtain plan, saying that the proposal to collect the tariffs for each other by the United Kingdom and the EU “is completely brain-free. ”
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of the murder of the LSU player
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting a 20-year-old LSU basketballer Wayde Sims' death.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison with a second-rate murder charge, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published a video of opposition between Sims and Simpson, and the police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, informed WAFB of the CBS.
After the Simpson interview, the police said he confessed to Wayde's shooting.
The lawyer reported that the man's bail was set at USD 350 000 (308 600.30).
The East Baton Rouge coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday, according to which a bullet wound in the neck caused death.
The department thanks the Southern University police and the people living in the region for the assistance provided in the investigation, which led to the arrest of the suspect.
The LSU sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the law enforcement authorities in the region for “setting custody and justice on foot.”
Sims was 20 years old.
A man of 1,98 metres grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball in the LSU.
Her previous season's games were 5,6 points and 2.6 table balls.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball trainer, Will Wade, said that the whole team was "beat" and "shocked" because of Wayde's death.
“ This is something you worry about all the time, ” Wade said.
The Vulkan will burst ash over Mexico City
The ash of a volcano called Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost part of the capital of Mexico.
A national disaster prevention centre warned the Mexicans on Saturday, ordering them to stay away from the volcano, since the crater started again, leading to the registration of 183 cases of gas emissions and ash burst within 24 hours.
The center was sailing on several medals and tremors.
Photos shared in social media represented a ash-coated car in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilcos.
The geophysics noticed an increase in the activity of a volcano located 72 km south of the capital after the 7.1 magnetic earthquake shuddered the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
Don Goyo's volcano has been active since 1994.
Police encountering conflicts with the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independent vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the attack of the protestors on independence, and thousands of people joined protests to celebrate the anti-defense vote against Katalonia.
A group of decoupled warriors, who were held back by the marble police, attacked the last with eggs and powder color, causing thick dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
The rivals also occurred later when the police had to use sniffs to control the fights.
For several hours, the singers of independence, “No forgetting, no forgiveness, ” confronted the country’s united demons who called “Spain!”
According to the local press, in 14 demonstrations, medical care received a minor injury.
Penguins continue to stand up in an autonomy area a year later, when Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October illegal, but which was still marked by catalysts in favour of the separation.
The voters strongly decided for independence, although the electoral activity was low because the vote was widely ignored by those who objected to the exclusion.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to put a vote against the polling departments throughout the region, which led to violent clashes.
Independants of independence had stayed in front of the voting departments on Friday night in order to avoid protests supported by the national police.
However, the remarks took place, but they had to take another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, who participated in a dissolution protest with his wife, said that he no longer had the hope to see Katalonia as independent.
“ Last year, one of the best moments of our life took place.
I saw my parents crying gladly about the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important but small victory in December last year, it has been difficult for the parties supporting the autonomy of the Catalan to maintain the feasibility of this year, because many of the most well-known leaders have gone to exile themselves or have been arrested and awaiting a trial on their part in the organisation of the referendum and on the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, recording a demonstration to support the police with his cell phone, said that the politicians both sides of the back were struggling.
“ The situation is becoming more and more tense, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junquera, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the pre-experience prison since the previous year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"The candidateship for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the retreat of democratic values and the pressures of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: The man was arrested because the car was crashed at the house
Three men in the ages of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car in Londonderry repeatedly raped the house.
The case took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building.
Also, at some point in the direction of the car, a bowl may have been shot.
Menga strike gives Livingston 1-0 victory in front of the Rangers
The first gate to Dolly Menga for Livingston was a victory.
Promoted by Livingston open Rangers to take Steven Gerrard to another loss during 18 games when the man has been the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga shot proved to be determinant when Gary Holt raised a level in a second to Hibernian.
Gerrard will not win the first league in this season and will meet the leading Hearts on the next Sunday, who are eight points down.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday at EuroLiiga.
In the meantime, Livingston extended his invincible attack to seven games, while Head Trainer Holt still felt the loss since Kenny Miler was replaced last month.
Livingston loses the opportunity for nyrian visitors
Holt's team should have been running long before they hit the gate, as their direct gambling has caused Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts fell before the gate, where Alan Lithgow made efforts to catch Craig Halkett's headband across the gate.
The foreigners calmly let Ranger play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the guests at certain places.
And it's also the way the predominant gate was hit.
Rangers gave up the breakout, and Livingston had a chance during which the scheme was played by Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and succeeded in the middle of the penalty zone.
By that time the Rangers were mainly in possession of the ball, but could not break through the defense, so Liam Kelly, the gatekeeper, was mostly calm.
The same pattern continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to protect the gate one time.
Ranger's gatekeeper Allan McGregor pushed Scott Pittman's hit, and Lithgow shined brightly in Livingston's next team work.
The attacks continued to reach Livingston's penal area and were consistently kicked out of it, and two of them were targeted, one of them for the attempt to replace Halket Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball's hand.
Phenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland, Alaska Lamont Tony Macaroni Stadium
Phenomenal tension and result from Livingston.
Each player was excellent, crossing the ladder upwards completely with expectations.
Their gambling style and players have barely changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt must be respected for the way he has escaped the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, providing excellently organized protection, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worral on the back legs throughout the game.
But the Rangers didn't have much encouragement.
Regardless of being at a good level between them under Gerrard's leadership, according to the examples here, there was little.
Their last mastering of the ball proved to be deficient: it only took place a time to reach the home, which could function as a alarm clock for Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan’s Controversial Resistance in Cologne
In Berlin on Saturday (September 29) there were both smiles and a cloud of concern when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast.
This is the last day of the controversial German visit to President Erdogan, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been excluded on issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Köln to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police referred to security by prohibiting the gathering of a population of 25 000 in front of the moskee, but a number of supporters appeared near to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan, most of whom are deaf, also condemned both Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to host the Turkish President in their country.
Fighting demonstrations show that the attitude toward a visitor is dispersed: some Turk who lives in Germany welcomes him as a hero, while others despise a man as a self - ruler.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: a rider died from a car crash
In London, a rider crashed against a car died.
The collision took place on a fast road near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 p.m. by British summer time.
The driver stopped and the help came to give me an ambulance, but the man died at the scene.
A few months later, the other rider died in a collision about two kilometers from a Saturday’s accident in Childers Street, where the driver who hit the rider escaped from the scene.
The London Police said that the authorities were involved in identifying the man and informing his loved ones.
In the event, the traffic is closed and the buses are modulated, and the drivers of motor vehicles are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison officials were injured in an unrest
The prison office reported that six prison officers were injured in an unrest in a very secure man prison.
The retaliation broke out in His Majesty's Long Lartin prison at Worcestershire on Sunday at 9:30 p.m. in British summer time and has not yet ended.
One wing of concentrated unrests involving eight prisoners is involved in dealing with expert police officers.
Inmate officials were treated for milder facial injury at the scene.
The press representative of the prison service said: “Experienced prison workers have been invited to resolve the ongoing case in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injury.
We can't tolerate any violence in our prisons, the responsibility is transferred to the police, and their sentences may be extended."
In HMP Long Lartin there are over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison manager was informed that hospital treatment was taken after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, however, the NYPD was invited to prison to silence the serious restlessness during which prison officials were attacked with billiard bullets.
Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (orching areas can be useful)
The tropical low pressure zone does not often hit Arizona, but this is likely to occur at the beginning of next week when the decaying orcaan Rosa moves over the Southwest of the United States, bringing the risk of sudden floods.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service has already arranged the surveillance of sudden floods in the western part of Arizona, the southern and eastern part of Nevada, the southern part of California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the prophecy, Rosa is headed straight over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the region on Monday with rainfalles.
The Phoenix National Weather Service stated that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have preserved tropical storms or low pressure levels in the 321.86 kilometers of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane which passed 64.37 km from the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the National Orcan Centre are predicting rainfalles between 5.08 and 10.16 centimeters, which can reach the limited areas of Arizonas Mogollon Rim up to 15.24 centimeters.
Other desert areas in the southwest of the United States, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Nest, are likely to have a rainfall of between 2.54 and 5.08 centimeters, reaching a limit of 10,16 centimeters.
Rosa’s rains can be a blessing in the face of the drought.
Although floods are very worrying, such rains are likely to be useful as droughts are in South-America.
According to the U.S. drought monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is extreme, or second-class drought, was informed byweather.com.
First, the orkana Rosa Baja crosses the California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still on Sunday morning, with the largest winds of 6,43 miles an hour, is now 619.95 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving at a speed of 19,31 kilometers north.
The storm is exposed to the cool waters of the Pacific, and that's why it's slowing down a bit.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will arrive on the land of Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or at the afternoon.
The number of rainfalles in certain areas of Mexico can be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
“ From Baja California to the Northwest of Sonora, rain rains with a total amount of 7,62 to 15,24 centimeters, at some point up to 25,4 centimeters, can be expected,” saidweather.com.
Rosa then heads north of the Mexican tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure squad moving across Arizona and reaching the southern part of Utah on Tuesday night.
“The danger that comes from Rosa or its aftermath is very strong rain attacks in Baja California, the northwestern part of Sonora and the desert in the southwest of the United States, ” said the National Orcan Center.
These rainfalles can cause life - threatening sudden floods and flooding water in the deserts and landings in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests related to the murder attempt
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested with a suspect of premeditated murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace region in Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 4:00 p.m. British summer time.
The victim was brought to the hospital in a "strated" state.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested in the Radstock area in Avon and Somerset, said the police.
Officials ask to contact anyone who may have cell phone recordings from the case.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “took ” the Democratic Party “in the face of rage and anger”
“The support of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump in his call of encouragement in Wheeligus in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “dressed” during his appointment process by the Democratic Party “in the face of war and anger.”
Kavanaugh gave testimony before the Congress on Thursday, deficiently and emotionally rejecting the charges of Christine Blasey Ford that a man attacked her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also gave a witness to his accusations.
The president said on Saturday, “America saw Kavanaugh's glory, quality and courage that day. ”
The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to appoint one of the most valued legislators of our time, who have an indecent background in public service," he said to the people in support of Western Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the election activity in the Republic in the interim elections.
“Five weeks have remained until one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
I'm not going to apply, but I'm actually applying for it," he said.
"That is why I am everywhere to fight on behalf of excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats have a mission aimed at “resisting and preventing”.
The first main trial vote on the Senate floor is expected to take place at the latest on Friday, said to CNN, the senior head of the Republican Party.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, the number of deaths is rising
At least 384 people died and many were drowned when the giant waves came to the beach after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered together on Friday at the beach festival in Palu city, when at the time of the dawn, waves of six metres hit the beach, killing a number of people and destroying everything left in the way.
Tsunami followed 7.5 magnitudes of earthquakes.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people still did their actions on the beach, not immediately escaped, as they were victims of disasters” said a press conference in Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Jakarta, the press representative of the Indonesian Destruction Agency.
“ The tsunami didn’t come alone, but took cars, logs and houses with him, washing everything off the ground, ” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km per hour on the high sea before it reached the shore.
Some people climbed to the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to Palu 24 centres.
Air photos published by the disaster agency showed a number of destroyed buildings and stores, broken and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
Additional waves in the coastal town continued on Saturday.
In the area with 2.4 million inhabitants, the wave of earthquakes was known.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Office (BPPT) stated in its statement that the energy released after a strong earthquake in Friday was nearly 200 times the amount of the nuclear bomb that was destroyed in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of a city near the long and narrow bay could increase the strength of the tsunami, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damage as “dimensional” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said that some of the victims' bodies were found under the wreckage of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number and damage of the victims may be higher in the coastal area 300 km north of Palus, Donggala, which was closer to the midst of the earthquake.
Reports from Donggala “are completely deficient and contain no information, ” said Nugroho.
“ There are more than 300 000 residents in the region, ” said Red Cross in his statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading to the affected places.
“ This is already a tragedy that can get worse, ” he said.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing the tsunami in the town of Palu, although the authorities said that the waves reached the beach while the warning was issued.
Amateur cadders spreading in social media see a man on the top of a building, who warns the panicked people on the streets below for a tsunami approaching.
Minutes later, the water wall reaches the beach, carrying houses and cars with them.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the correctness of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive shock of electricity, which prevented the link between the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to carry out rescue operations.
The army has started sending transport planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuators still need food and other basic supplies.
The airport located in the city was reopened for rescue operations, remaining otherwise closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centres on Sunday.
Indonesian tsunami increased more than 800.
That's very bad.
Although the World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where they were hidden in the present tents set up in their office’s courtyard, they saw devastated sights on their way, Mr Doseba said.
“ They said that they saw many destroyed houses, ” he said.
That's very bad.
Although the helpers strongly started action to mitigate the disaster, partly complained that highly experienced workers of foreign assistance organisations were prevented from travelling to Palus.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supplies and aids from abroad can only be sent if the place of accident is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, Indonesian press representative of the Red Cross.
"If the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can start to accept international aid, but this situation has not yet been declared."
When the second night, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the second night arrived, the people’s friends and families were still full of hope that their loved ones were these wonderful events that relieve the birth of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was lifted out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman who was trapped two days next to the body of her mother.
Indonean National Sliding Chairman's team coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing slider parachute drivers for Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of the people trapped in Roa Roa's hotel are his students, added Mr. Mandag.
“ I have a personal burden as a seniori slider, ” he said.
Mr Gendon spoke about how after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he despaired his messages from WhatsApp to the competitors who were at the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
“I think that means the messages didn’t get there, ” he said.
The thieves took EUR 23 585.88 while carrying out the bank machine in Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, the thieves stole EUR 23 585.88 from the Brink staff filling the Levees banking machine, published in the press release of the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptyed out a bank machine at the entertainment facility and prepared to bring more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in a press release.
When the man acted, “the other man ran behind Brink’s worker ” and stole a supply bag full of money.
The Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, writing a press announcement, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person with information about the thieves is asked to contact the Newport police on the phone (+01633) 859-292-33680.
Kanye West: the rapper takes his new name Ye
Rapper Kanye West turns his name to Ye.
On Saturday, the man reported a change on Twitter wrote: “Endine Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been called by the nickname Ye for a while, and the man also used the name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change will take place before his performance by sending Saturday Night Live, where a man is expected to publish his new album in Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled his concert “in the drive of feelings,” said the author.
In addition to the abbreviation of the man’s current performer name, West has previously said that it is a word of religious importance for him.
"I think "ye" is one of the most used words in the Bible, which means "you," said West earlier, discussing the name of his album with the radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“For this I am you, I am us, these are us.
I changed my name from Kanye, which means "the one", called Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, of our confusion and of everything else.
"The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye West is not the only rapper who plays his name.
Sean Combs is mainly known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that they prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, formerly co-operated with West, has also used his name with and without the point of view, in large and small letters.
The Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use an army against civilians.
At a time when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks against students, the Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he would never use an army against civilians.
On Sunday, Lopez Obrador promised in Telleolco Plaza that he would never use a military force to control the Mexicans.
The military attacked the peaceful demonstration on the field on 2 October 1968, killing 300 people during the whole of Latin America, when left-hand student movements were carried.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying students monthly grants and opening more free national universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence.
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount allocated to research in this area,” said the donor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were published after the various parts of the US government made statements on artificial intelligence, although the USA has generally no official strategy on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, China introduced its plan last year to be an actor in the renewal of the artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Duplication of the research budget for technical intelligence would be a good start, given that other countries are so much behind the US and we are acting on behalf of the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence,” said Lee.
The double funding would double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence achievement would be achieved in the United States, said the interview to Lee CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Sinnovation Ventures company, which funded one of the most outstanding artificial intelligence companies in China Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that won the best Othello player in America. He later was a man in Microsoft Research and president of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged previous US government technology competitions such as the US Defense Ministry of Defense Research Projects Agency (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge) and asked when the next competition would be to help identify the following dreamers.
“ US scientists have to work hard to get funding from the government, ” said Lee.
“Chinese isn’t the one who takes over the academics, they’re companies, ” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy could help the US to support efforts by the Artificial Intelligence.
“I think that people who have received a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered a green card, ” said the man.
The Chinese National Council published the next generation of industrial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Science Fund distributes funding to people working in academic institutions, as is the way the National Research Fund and other government institutions grant money to US scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” said Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a united centre of artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from both industry and educational institutions. However, the White House announced the establishment of a Committee selected by the Artificial Intelligence Agency.
This month, DARPA announced that it began to finance the two million-dollar initiative AI Next.
But the National Research Fund finances more than $100 million a year in scientific research related to artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the US legislation, which was designed to create a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has not been amended.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of national name
The Macedonians voted during a Sunday referendum on whether to convert the name of the country into the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that would also resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented the acceptance of the declarations of membership of the EU and NATO in Macedonia.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a requirement for that territory and has prohibited Macedonia to join NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on the new name of Macedonia, but national opponents claim that the name would damage the national identity of the Macedonian Slavic population.
President Ivanov said that he did not intend to take part in the referendum and that the non-discrimination campaign has raised doubts about whether the electoral activity reaches the level of participation necessary for the 50% of the referendum.
The referendum asks: "Do you support the accession of Macedonia to NATO and the EU, accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the amendment, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price paid to Macedonia, which is one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure the accession of organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they are following the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires two thirds of Parliament's majority.
The National Election Commission said that at 13:00 no reports of irregularities are available.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections when 66 per cent of the voters registered.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place in Europe," said the 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
On 30 September 2018, the Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son, Dushko voted in Strumica during the referendum on the change of the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, a 54-year-old, prepared a small stage in front of a parliamentary building in Skopje, raising the tents for those who ignore the referendum.
"We want to be part of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head up, not through the door of servants," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and get from the integration of Europe-Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev said that membership of NATO would bring the necessary investments in Macedonia with an unemployment rate of more than 20 %.
“I believe that a large majority supports the change of name, because more than 80 percent of the citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO," said Zaev after voting.
He said that the word "yes" would be a confirmation of our future.
The results of the survey published on Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia revealed that the referendum intends to take 30-43% of the voters under the necessary electoral activity.
A survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said that you would answer yes.
The success of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be a first serious hit on the government's western policy after the government took over last year's May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero is going through the entire Brighton Defense on behalf of the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defense, guaranteeing Manchester City 2–0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like the gate that was hit by his 65th gaming minute was ridiculously easy.
Argentine attacker crossed the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He penetrated through three Brighton defenders before he got to the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He penetrated another defender before he ran past several players at the border of Brighton's penal.
Then he hit the ball on his left with Sterling.
The English attacker used the first shot to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to hit the Brighton gatekeeper Mathew Ryan on the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with its legs," said the Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola reporters.
“We talked about him playing at 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he just hit the gate."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues an initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
The gate was hit in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly in Brighton's territory.
He sent the ball from the air to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane got to hit the ball a few times before he led Sterling away.
Sky Blues pulled the ball off the net just before it slipped out the boundaries.
Manchester City plays with the Master League in the subgroup of Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a cheerleader against Rockies.
When the Nationals missed the final tournament, there was no reason for the new start.
However, the fight-loving Scherzer hopes to do the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but it is only when Rockies, who runs the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in NL West, still has the hope to get to the final.
Rockies guaranteed at least 5-2 wins over Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wishes to secure its first division.
“While we don’t play for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing in the atmosphere of the audience and the other team in Denver is probably at a higher level than any other game I can expect this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete here?"
Nationals have not yet appointed a Sunday opening player, but they are allegedly tended to have Scherzer eaten in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th feeding, made a warming bath on Thursday and a feed on Sunday as usual.
This right-hand player in Washington runs 18-7, with its ERA 2,53, the number of kicks 300 and the advantageous options of its 220 2/3 during this season.
Trump's having a stimulating call in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to a situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while speaking about the importance of the election activity in the Republic in the interim elections.
“All we have done is on the line in November.
Five weeks before our lives, one of the most important elections.
This is a big event I do not apply, but I actually apply, and I am therefore everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, extremely extreme group of Democrats, and you see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they have decided to take back power using any means, you see their evil and dirty game.
The only thing they want is power and control, and we don't give them that."
Democrates are according to his claim on the mission “to resist and to prevent. ”
“ And you have seen it in the last four days, ” he said, calling the Democrats “wounds, wicked, ruthless, and lying. ”
He referred, by his name, to Senator Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judicial Commission, who was screamed out loudly among the audience.
“ Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak that document?
Uh, huh, what?
No, no, wait, it was one of the worst examples of body tongue, actually the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a big connection.
It is intolerable to those who express their opinions
When my local party's activists voted to condemn me, it wasn't quite surprising.
After all, I am the last of the Leborist Members' list to whom you are told that you are not welcome, and all of this for the publication of your opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Mr Ryan, became the same as he was strongly opposed to anti-Jewishness.
In my case, the judges condemned me for non-convenience with Jeremy Corbyn.
A responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which, in a strange way, are similar issues, which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party announced that “we would like the meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
In most cases, the experience of my eight-year local camper is exactly the same with the meetings of the Friday evening General Assembly.
Unfortunately, it is no longer valid for most meetings today, and the promise to be "good and generous" in politics has long been forgotten when it was ever remembered.
It is increasingly obvious that the various perspectives are not acceptable in the Labour Party and that for each opinion it is assessed who is acceptable to the Party's Board.
It started just after Jeremy became the leader, a coworker with whom I thought I had previously thought to share similar political views was now waiting for me to change my mind and take the views that I would otherwise have never accepted, whether it was national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I step up in the public place, no matter what I really say, it is followed by a condemnation in social media, encouraging my retreat, ignoring the party's policy and saying that I should not be part of the Leiborist party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more lucky than some of my fellow workers, because my comments are mostly political.
I admire the competence and discretion of those workers who face sexual or racist abuse every day, but never fail.
One of the most disappointing views in this policy area is how abuse levels have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Leiborist party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is, however, that we are no longer so large and that every initiative of "unfaithfulness" or any change in the election rules will become more narrow in the party.
I have been given a lot of advice over the past two years to keep my head down, to talk less, and "that would be all right."
But that's not what I came to do in politics.
From the moment I joined the Leiborist Party 32 years ago, motivated by the negligence of the Government of Thatcher, which had left my large school classroom literally to collapse, I have tried to speak for better public services to those who most need it, acting as a local council member and minister.
I've never concealed my policy, including the last elections.
There is no way that someone in Nottingham East was confused about my political positions or the areas of non-convenience with the local management.
For all those who promoted movements on Friday, I would like to say that if a country is moving towards Brexit, which damages households, businesses and our public services, I do not want to understand my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is for Nottingham's Momentum, but for my supporters, whether they are part of the Leiborist party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one threat or political consideration will stop me from acting for what I think is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr is moving to the top
Two late events may have been somewhat diminishing the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves the victory of the first fun Tennant game.
They're now the only unattended team in the front of the table of ten.
Finally, it was a high level of protection for the team and a better take of risks, which led home teams to victory and coach Peter Murchie has the right to be completely satisfied.
"We have been tested all the time in the games and we are still invincible, so of course I am happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "I'm going to have a story about Ayris, they're using their options better than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th game test, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayri an advantage, but the Scottish captain, Rory Hughes, who gave Warriors to play, gave Melros a chance where Jason Baggot had failed the test.
Climo increased the advances of Ayri by a penalty strike shortly before the end of the half-time, reaching the status of 17 to 5 Ayri at the end of the single event.
But Melrose started the second Polish time successfully, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which was taken over by Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
Then a long delay took place due to a serious injury to Ruairdh Knott, after which the man was taken off the carrier frame. As the game continued, Ayr’s predecessors increased further thanks to the attempt by Stafford McDowall, forwarded by Climo.
Ayri's active captain Blair Macpherson was then on a yellow card, but again, Melrose's player paid for Bruce Colvine's attempt for failing transmission after he was severely pressured.
However, the team playing on the homefield again gained strength, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for preventing Climo on the line of a ball-free penetration, MacPherson put the ball behind the advanced Ayri.
Climo passed the ball, as he did almost immediately after the game continued, when Kyle Rowe tried to hit David Armstrong and sent the side guard Gregor Henry to go out on the homefield on the fifth test of a team playing.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
The Star of Still Game Ford Kieran seems to be ready to enter the hosting services after it was discovered that the man was appointed director of the approved restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a well-known BBC TV series that he writes and plays with Greg Hemphill, a long-term comedy partner.
The couple have reported that the nineth season ahead will be the last of the series and it seems that Kiernan will make life after Craiglang's new plans.
According to official records, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but the source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan would like to enter Glasgow’s “rich restaurant business”.
"The sea is ours," Bolivia hopes that the court will open their way back to the Pacific
Marines patrol the Navy Headquarters in La Paz.
Sea blue flags are flying over the buildings of the Authority.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon have a proverb: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to restore it."
The memory of the coastline, which was lost in a bloody resource conflict in Chile in the 19th century, is still alive in Bolivia without sea borders. The same living is the desire to resee the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the highest in the past decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice of 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has a spirit of profoundness, unity and peace, and the country is naturally waiting for a yes," said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A number of Bolivians across the country will look at the decision of the international court on large screens in the hope that the Hague Court will decide on Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia in order to give the last independent road to the sea after decades of break-up discussions.
The Bolivian charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales, who is awaiting a conflicting battle to re-election next year, is at stake by decision of Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he swore at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, think that it is likely that the court will not vote in favour of Bolivia, or, if so, it would become very little.
The United Nations authorities in the Netherlands do not have the power to issue the territory of Chile and it has provided that the outcome of possible negotiations is not determined.
The fact that the decision of the International Court is only six months after hearing the final statements indicates that it was not a "complex case", said the Chile’s expert in international law, Paz Zarate.
And by far from the additional causes of Bolivia, the last four years may have deteriorated the situation.
"The problem of access to the sea has been robbed by the current Bolivian authorities," said Zarate.
Morales’ military speech of beauty has lost all of Chile’s remaining goodwill, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after all, the debate is extremely difficult.
Two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the court was unnecessaryly urgent.
Monday gives Bolivia “a extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most well-known presidents in Latin America, is using the maritime issue to express a political wrath.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific Sea,” he added.
"It is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea said that the release of nuclear weapons will not take place until the country can trust the United States of America.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho said that his people will never give up nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Meeting.
He called on the United States to review the promises made by the competitors' leaders at the Singapore Summit.
He comments at the time Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, almost seems to reopen nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Uni in Singapore.
According to Ri, it is a matter of airbags, in the opinion that the United States continues to limit and refuse to terminate the declaration of war with Korea will make North Korea surrender.
Washington is careful about such a manifestation if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards disarming.
Both Kim and President of the United States, Donald Trump, want another summit.
However, skepticism is widespread, according to which Pyongyang is seriously intending to abandon the armed arms that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on another summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion courts will bring to the audience a series of massive head covers that will be delivered to buyers on their shopping streets in the neighbourhood
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you will no longer have to look for it.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought to the stages of their summer season in 2019 a series of very strange head covers that blinded Paris' fashion week.
High and unpracticable hats are through Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their footsteps to the designs.
Valentino’s top work was the heads of the models covered by a superficial beige hat, decorated with a wide extremity resembled to close.
Other supernatural clothing included arbeit with jewels, a magic hat and even an ananas, but their purpose is not to heat.
Thom Browne also showed a strange choice of masks, doing it exactly on time before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks were sealed with kisses, so they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high.
One part of the creation looked like a diving bag with air pipe and glasses, while the other looked like a melted ice cream tube.
And if you keep going with the giant mowery, you'll be lucky.
Moegurus predict that superb head covers can also reach the shopping streets near you.
The superb hats are coming right on the side of La Bomba, which is a 60 centimeter wide hat, seen on the head of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural mark that created a largely unpractical hat in social media sent another great piece to the designer — a shore bag of shoulders — almost as large as the model with the bikinis bearing it.
The dark-orange raffic bag with raffias and white leather snacks was the top edition of the summer collection of Jacquemus La Riviera in 2019 on the Paris fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags in the shopping streets next summer. Since the designer has had such a major impact, it would be difficult to ignore demand for overwhelming clothing."
John Edward: Language Knowledge Is Important to World Citizens
The private schools in Scotland have remained at the top of the academic excellence and continued in 2018 with the following outstanding results of the exam, which are reinforced by personal and joint success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, where more than 30 000 students are studying across Scotland and represented by the Scottish Private Schools Board (SCIS), are trying to provide the best service for their students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for additional and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement a curriculum adapted to conditions, we can see that modern languages are still known in schools and the desired subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language that is understandable to him, it comes to his head.
When you speak to him in his mother tongue, it reaches his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to create relations and trust with people from other countries.
From the fresh test results of this year, we can see that languages at the top of the tables are the highest in private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received a high score of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students became a mandarin A, 72 percent of German students received the same score, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages, which are now among curriculum choices, are in private schools and other schools' curriculums as well as STEM curriculums ( Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
A study carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that 17% of respondents had no language skills for employers, among the reasons why it is difficult for employers to find workers for jobs.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly obligatory to prepare young people for their future jobs.
In so far as more hopeful job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Notwithstanding the career choice made, the acquisition of another language will give the person a real advantage in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign nationals gives a multilingual advantage immediately.
According to the UK survey of more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of respondents speak no foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. The only language with a two-digit percentage of experts was French with 15%.
Therefore, funding for language learning is important for children today.
Knowledge of a number of languages, especially the languages of developing countries, provides better opportunities for children to find good work.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at each school.
Many schools focus more on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the UK for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interests, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between a number of languages that are taught by experts in their field.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and provides them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future will bring to them.
It can no longer be denied that languages are of paramount importance for the future of the country in a global business environment, and therefore it must also be reflected in education.
It is true that modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills. ”
Private schools continue to offer young Scotland a choice, diversity and excellentness.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron's making his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The enthusiastic fans don't have to wait to see LeBron James make their debut at Los Angeles Lakers.
Trainer Luke Walton of Lakes reported that James plays against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday pre-season.
But the number of play minutes still needs to be determined.
“ This is more than one and less than 48," said Walton Lakers’ official website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell quoted that James is probably playing a number of minutes.
After training last week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six-playing pre-season schedule.
“I do not need my career at this stage of pre-season games to warm myself,” he said.
Trump West Virginia Election campaign event, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will begin his election campaign event series tonight in Wheeling in West Virginia.
This is the first five campaign events planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the approval vote is held until Trump is elected to be appointed as a free seat in the Supreme Court, he seeks to increase support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatened to lose control at the Congress following the vote in November.
What time is Trump's tonight's campaign event in West Virginia, and how do you view it online?
Trump's campaign event in Wheelingu, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday night, September 29, 2018 at 19:00 on the East Coast time.
The Trump Western Virginia campaign event can be viewed on the Internet through YouTube flow.
Trump will probably talk about the sessions of this week, Brett Kavanaugh, candidate of the Supreme Court, which became tense about the charges of sexual abuse, while the Senate's confirmation vote has been suspended for a week until the FBI investigates the matter.
However, the main objective of the series of campaign events is to help the Republicans who face difficult elections in November.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign leader said that the aim of these five events next week is to “inspire volunteers and supporters when the Republicans are trying to protect and extend to them the majority of Senat and the House of Representatives," Reuters broke up.
“The control of the Congress is so important for the president's agenda that Trump is going to a rapid election campaign with as many states as possible,” said Reuters, the press representative of the Trump campaign, who did not want to mention his name.
Tonight's campaign event, designed to take place at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheelich, can bring backers from “Ohiost and Pennsylvania and also to be reflected in the Pittsburgh media”, reported Metro News from West Virginia.
Saturday is the second time Trump visited West Virginia during the last month. This is a state where he received more than 40 percent of the voters' votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senate Candidate Patrick Morrisey from the Republic of Western Virginia, who is conducting the show on the basis of interviews.
“For Morrisey it is not a good sign that the president has come to encourage his results,” said the politician Simon Haeder of the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team will be able to compete by keeping hopes high in front of Sunday alone games
After three unilateral sessions, the games took place on Saturday afternoon were sometimes exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The volatile turning point pendel is a completely imaginative concept of sport, but the players truly believe in it, especially in competitions like this here.
So, where do they think there's a turning point now?
“They led the six points, which have now become four, so I think I can consider it a little turning point,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has a advantage, that is clear, because it is driven by four points and there are 12 more points in the game.
According to Spieth, the Americans feel that they don't have enough wind in their sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the face of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each had three of the four points.
Spieth has been walking on both the wing and the grin and shows the example.
These racing screams came out of the throat and became more and more louder in every circle, shaping a determinant puzzle that would have led to the fourth fight after he and Thomas were down with two.
His puzzle, which won the match on 15th, sent a similar call that showed the man's faith that the Americans are not yet out of competition.
“ You just have to play more focused and worry about your fight, ” said Spieth.
It's the only thing the players can do.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomasel have the unquestionable stars of Ryder Cup on Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's strange but loved couple is four out of four, and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and backing on Friday mornings.
This game and the way their energy flows to a sober crowd, and back from there, strengthens the view that the players with which the sun is competen on Sunday, and that if the sun drops across the Le Golf National, the most known player to confirm the European victory is not Fleetwood or Molinari.
Both preferably in different holes at the same time.
However, the story of Europe's glory is remarkable.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero this morning, a quick job when the man was set with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the two doubles in the first nine dig a Spanish and Swedish hole so deep that they had no hope to dig themselves out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one to help you out in the hole.
Four-balls and pair games are extremely attractive to look close to the communications between couples, advice to each other, unaccompanied advice and how the way can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has started to lead a strong predecessor for the last day, but this session of the fours has shown that the U.S. team is fighting with a nerve that has some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe is headed on the last day of Ryder Cup 10-6
On the last day of Ryder Cup, Europe will have a good precedent, starting to run 10 to 6 in front of the United States after Saturday's four-balls and coupled games.
The great Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led two victorious Tiger Woods to raise their current score to four points in Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who contributed two years ago to the preservation of the coke lost in Hazeltine, reigned after the failure of the American side in the morning in the four-balls, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in a couple of games, winning two games, but they couldn't compensate for the deficit.
Jim Fury's half needs eight points of 12 single games on Sundays to keep a cup.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who won four points in a row. Together with Molinar, who, after this weekend, is called Molliwood, they are the second couple who have won four in their four opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After destroying the four-balls Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit, undermining Woods and the American algae Bryson Dechambeauveel with more reassurance: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed a random shiny, but now lost his 29 four-balls and a pair of 19, giving seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in four balls for the morning, returned with partner Henrik Stenson to a couple of games, win 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is in the world order at the first and third place.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was considered to be a pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, the three-fold big winner, set the Americans on Saturday, two points as a benchmark.
They received a strong victory of 2-1 Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, returning later and winning in a couple of games Poulter and Rory McIlroyd 4-3 after losing two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, the team has come back from a four-point deficit, going to individual games, although as owners, the Furyk side only needs a fiction to preserve the cup.
While being in the right second place for two days, after a Sunday counter-attack, it seems that they won't succeed.
North Korea says "no way" they're not disarmed unilaterally because of lack of trust
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the continued restrictions intensified their reliability to the United States and that the country is not going to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho said at the World Organisation's Annual Meeting that North Korea has taken “remarkable goodwill measures” over the last year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, the destruction of nuclear testing site and the promise of nuclear weapons and the non-proliferation of nuclear technology.
“But we do not see that the United States would have answered it,” he said.
“Unless trusting the US, our country does not have security security, and in any way, in such circumstances, we do not agree to unarm ourselves unilaterally first.”
Although Ri reiterated the known complaints of North Korea regarding Washington’s opposition to the "steady-stage" approach to the nuclear-free transformation on the basis of which North Korea is rewarded when it takes steps to step, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject the unilateral resignation of nuclear weapons, as Pyongjang has done in the past.
Mr Ri referred to the joint statement of Kim Jong Uni and Donald Trump at the first United States president of 12 June and North Korea's leader in Singapore when Kim promised to move towards “the renunciation of the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons” and Trump allowed security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has requested a formal termination of the Korean war 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also been opposed to the calls to relax the strict international constraints on North Korea.
"The United States demands "first resignation of nuclear weapons" and increases the pressure on restrictions to achieve their goal in a forced manner, even in opposition to the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“ The idea that limitations push us on our knees is a dream for people who do not know us at all.
But the problem is that continued restrictions deepen our credibility."
Mr Ri did not mention the second summit plans of Kim and Trump, which the head of the United States in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out the meeting between the three leaders of Kim and South Korea, Moon Jae-in in the last five months, and added: “If one of the parties to the issue of nuclear weapons were South Korea and not the USA, the issue of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such an impasse.”
However, Ri's speech was sharply different from that of last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to approach North Korea's missiles to the US continent after Mr Paha President Trump called Kim a "missile man" at the suicide mission.
Last year, North Korea commended Trump, who threatened to completely destroy Kim's sky in the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards disarming, but added that there is still a lot to do and that restrictions must remain in force until North Korea has ceased nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no timetable for this, saying: “Does it take two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia think that the UN Security Council should pay for the measures taken by Pyongang.
At the same time, the U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: “The enforcement of the Security Council restrictions must continue with force and fail until we can fully and ultimately confirm the renunciation of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions applicable to North Korea in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri next to the United Nations General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea this year three times, although the last trip didn't go very well.
After the July meeting with Pyongyang, he said that progress has been made after what North Korea has only been condemned for a few hours after ‘ Gangster demands’.
In this month, North Korea allowed Moon to dismantle rockets and nuclear complex if the United States of America would implement “compliant measures”.
He told him that Kim had told him that he meant the security guarantees allowed in Trump Singapore and the movement towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students learn how to get enough rest
This year Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to fight a growing aggressive culture where they learn through night-to-night study marathons in caffeine rich.
Students who love the world’s best university of academicism are often helpless when it comes to the basic facts of self - care.
The designer of this course, Professor Charles Czeisler of the Dream Doctor and Brigham of Harvard Medical School and Professor of Women's Hospital, believes that this is the first of its own in the United States.
He inspired the establishment of a course after he held a speech about how sleep disorders affect learning.
“ At the end of this, a girl came to me and asked: ‘ Why is it telling me now, in my last year of school? ’
He said that no one ever told him the importance of sleep - it hit me as a carpenter," he explained to Telegraph.
The course that came to the curriculum for the first time this year explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic results and also contribute to improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatric and head of health at Harvard Medical School, said that the university decided to take the course’s curriculum after it was found that the students had a serious sleep deficiency during the working week.
The hourly course covers a number of counteractive tasks.
One part shows a picture of a common room. It allows students to click on cups, curtains, sports footwear and books and to explain the effects of caffeine and light how sleeplessness affects sports results and the importance of the practice of bedtime.
The second part explains to participants how long-term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The campus map, along with the counteractive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily practices.
“ We know that this does not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," Professor Czeisler added.
He said that nightmarathons are still proud of, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep shortages are still a growing problem.
“Safeting a high-quality sleep garden should be the student’s "secure weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety," he added. “It will even help you to get weight gained, as a lack of sleep makes the brain hungry, making a person constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler to create a course after taking part in one of his classes last year in his first Harvard year.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a university course.
In the next step, he would like all graduate students to pass a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set a wake watch for both sleep and awakening, and to be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and the ‘blue light’ caused by LED light, as this could damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Gate defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bad guest game when the hit by Dolly Menga, sent by Steven Gerrard, brought 1-0 victory to Livingston.
At Ibrox's side, he was hoping to get his first visit since February when the 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but Gary Holt's team only caused the second loss of Gerrard's 18 game leader, leaving the leader of Ladbrokes Premiership at eight points from Hearts.
Menga hit his gate seven minutes before the Pole, and the poor preparedness of Rangers couldn't recover from it.
The Ranger therefore falls to the sixth position, Livingston rises to the third position, remaining down to Hibernian with only one gate.
For Rangers, the problems may not be over, because their attacker, Calum Spence, needed a head wound after he was killed with an object that was probably lost.
Gerrard made eight changes on the side that took over Ayr and the Betfred Cup semifinal.
But Holt went on at the same time with the same Livi 11, who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been satisfied with the way his well-trained boys strangled their opponents every step.
The Rangers may have been much more predominant in the village, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have hit the gate at the second opening minute when Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's gate, but the half defender didn't use his chance.
Deep Keaghan Jacobs' free hit then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to make a wide-range hit in the back of the post.
The Rangers were controlled, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt certain that he should have been punished when he confronted Steven Lawless in 15 minutes, Judge Steven Thomson did not meet the Columbia player's complaint.
In the first half, the Ranger managed to target only two strikes, but the former Ibrox Gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, was not concerned about the lassana Coulibaly headset or the Ovie Ejaria event.
Although the opening of Liv’s 34th minute could have violated the rules of the game, no one can deny that they earned it purely for their performances.
Again, Rangers couldn't control Jacobs' deep performance.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and chose Menga, who just completed the plan.
Gerrard operated during the break, switching to Coulibaly Ryan Kent, and this shift almost paid off when the edge player split Morelos, but the impressive Kelly flipped out of his position.
But Livingston continued to lure the guests to play exactly the kind of game that fits them where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
The Holt side could have promoted its leadership at the final stage, but McGregor stood firmly, preventing Jacobs before Lithgow hit the big corner.
The Ranger substitute player Glenn Middleton again requested a penalty when he went up with Jacobs, which Thomson didn't satisfy again.
Almanah: Inventor of Geiger's Counter
And now the page of our Sunday Morning Almanak: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago and LEADADES ... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that finally led to a device known as Geiger's counter.
From this foundation of science Geiger became the basement of pop culture, like in the 1950 Coronado Watches, where they were seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
It is possible to hear the podine of atoms released from the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, it's just a mess!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “vise” traitor cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "vise" fraudulent cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system as part of the treatment of fraudulent cells
The method includes the administration of immune cells from the patient and the modification of these cells in the laboratory.
Then they can “see” a joint protein for many cancers and they will be injected back.
The vaccine in the study shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman treated with a vaccine to teach the detection of fraudulent cells to the immune system lost ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory to receive “see” proteins that have spread to different HER2 cancers, and then these cells are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Institute of Cancer in Bethesdas Maryland, explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “instructs the growth of many types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancers,” Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach in which immune cells are taken from patients and trained to target cancer cells has been used to treat certain types of leukaemia.
Kanye West started with the supportive tribe of Trump, wearing a MAGA hat on direct SNL.
It didn't go very well.
You will send in the Saturday Night Live studio to Kanye West a disgraceful choir, after his insane speech, in which he praised President Donald Trump of the United States and announced his candidate for the same post in 2020.
After that night his third song, which was named Ghost Town, and where he wore a hat with a letter Make America Great, he began to play against the rival Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“ I have spoken so much with white people who ask me, ‘ How can you please Trump, he is a race? ’
"If I were so worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL started the device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood's fame made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Committee of Judges regarding the alleged sexual violence of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this part of the show didn't go to the broadcast, West's sound cameras were uploaded to the comic Chris Rock social media.
It has become unclear whether Rock was trying to blaspheme with West.
He also complained to the audience that he had a pretty hard time behind the bowls of his hat.
“ They fooled me behind the stage.
They said I wouldn't go in there, hat in my head.
They fooled me!
And then they say I'm drowned in the place," he said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see a drowned place? I put on my Superman's cap because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments triggered at least two resentments of the viewers and seemed embarrassed by the SNL team. Variety stated: “The whole studio was deadly.”
West had been put in the show at the last moment to replace Ariana Grande because the former boyfriend of the singer's ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West amazed many with the song I Love it, which he looked like a Perrier bottle at the time of his presentation.
West received support from the head of the Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who said: “To one brave soul: ELKENAME, THAUGGESID HADATA.”
But the escort manager Karen Hunter quoted that West was just “the one who he is, and it is completely wonderful.”
“But I decided not to reward someone who, in my opinion, believes and distributes a harmful world view to my community by buying my music or clothing or by supporting her “kunst. ”
He's free.
Like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name, saying that he is now “the former Kanye West.”
He's not the first singer to change his performer's name, following Diddy, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the newly formed musical legent Prince, who turned his name into a symbol.

The fame of the Throns game Kit Harington does not approve cow masculinity
Kit Harington is well-known for his sword's flashing role in Jon Snowina HBO's violent medieval fantasie game.
But an actor (31) puts down the type of aggressive hero stereo, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough.
Speaking with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that "something has gone wrong" and raised the question of how to solve the masculinity problem of the coconut #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie (31) to his interrogation of the throne game, acknowledged that she feels “hardly” that this problem needs attention.
“ I feel very strongly now that we have gone wrong with maleness, ” he said.
“What have we taught men when they grow up about the problem that we now see? ”
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the rising masculinity of the coat because it shows superhuman characters.
He continued: “What is inborn, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, it gives young boys the sense that they need to be just the way they want to be men.
I think that is really one of the biggest questions of our time - how to change it?
'Cause obviously something has gone wrong for young men."
In the survey, he also admitted that after the end of the series, he would never participate in any of the Trones’ games, saying that he was “to the end of his battlefields and horses. ”
Since November, Kit is involved in the revitalising of Sam Shepard True West, about the story of the filmmaker and his robbery brother.
An actor recently announced that he thinks he's meeting his wife, Rose, is the best thing about the Thron game.
“ I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life, ” she said.
Rose played with Emmy in the show of fantasy of Ygritte, Kit's character, Jon Snow loved.
A couple married in Leslie’s family home in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased to 14%.
According to health care professionals, more than 820 000 people are affected by this disease.
Some 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have come from sex, changing the past.
HIV spread in some parts of China through blood transfusions .
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had declined to almost zero, confirmed by the Chinese health officers at a conference in the Yunnan Province.
Yearly, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalised in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is allegedly large.
Due to the obsolete values of the country, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are finally married to women.
Many transmissions of diseases relate to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has allowed general access to HIV medicines to resolve the problem.
Maxine Waters denys the leakage of GOP senator's data by saying that it's "hazardous lies" and "swording theories"
On Saturday, a US representative of Maxine Waters condemned the allegations that his employee had posted the personal data of three republic senators on the Wikipedia pages.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are distributed by “Utra-legislative” trolls and their websites.
“White, lies, and even more despairing lies,” said Waters in his Twitter statement.
The published information allegedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of the US senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (some of Utah).
Information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Panel in connection with claims of sexual abuse against the Candidate of the Riigikogu Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked a little after the three senators had interviewed Kavanaugh.
Old-minded websites such as Gateway Pundi and Red State reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of posting, was linked to the Waters office and issued information from a member of a worker under Waters, reported Hill.
“This unfounded claim is a complete and absolute lie,” continued Waters.
“My employees, whose personality, personal data and safety are threatened by these fraudulent and false claims, are in no way responsible for the leaks of this information.
This unfounded claim is a complete and irrefutable lie."
Waters’ statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, including one of the judges was former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
“This denial is the result of anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“This indicates that he has a sensitivity that is not suited to a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of something they haven't done, they can't get angry.
They mustn't be depraved.
They must not question the accusers' motives.
They have to stay calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare the Waters response to the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Also, the republic candidate Omar Navarro, who will apply for Waters during the intermittent elections, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“ It meant when it was the truth, ” he cried.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities with regard to their fraudulent claims.”
“ We will do everything in our power to find out the criminals, ” he continued, “and that they would legally be responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees. ”
Film Johnny English Strikes Againn Review - Undercover Rowan Atkinson Spion Parade
At present, it is customary to look for the meanings of Brexit in all the new British films and it seems to be particularly appropriate for Johnny English's revitalismédia parody series, which began in 2003 with Johnny English, and in 2011, he received a sequence of Johnny English Reborn - revitalisation.
Is the humorous joke about how foolish are we obviously in the country's new export option?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with a puzzle-eyed rubber face has been allowed to do things again in a handsome way - and that this broad comic creation is intended for non-English-speaking film sites.
Of course, it is a secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretension-glamour, reminds me a little bit of Clouseau, a little Mr Bean and a little character who gave a tone to the Chariots of Fire's story on the Opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on a characteristic traveller and the international mysterious Atkinson, who was once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, who leaves only chaos.
There's only one or two delightful moments in this last J.E. film.
I liked the approach to Johnny English's helicopter when he wore a medieval iron robe and helicopter wings for once he was struggling against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent is shown to make physical comedy, but humor seems less important and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" spionic films like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer themselves confidently comedy.
This humor seems to be more intended for children than for adults, and for me, Johnny English's delusional adventures are not so vindicious and concentrated as Atkinson's dark films as Beanina.
Today, the current presumption that Britain is in serious trouble is forever.
Cyberhaker has penetrated the network of highly classified spies in Britain, revealing the personality of all British undercover police officers, causing a great disappointment to an agent on the ground - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a celebrational and troubled person who suffers from the burden of political in popularity: Emma Thompson does this terrificly for Teresa-May character, but the manuscript does not have much to work on.
His intelligence counselors suggest that since all active spies are threatened, he must call back someone who has retired.
And this means Johnny English, who now works as a coliber in one of the proud institutions, giving secret lessons about being a secret agent: here is a couple of good places where English offers school of Rock to a spy school.
English will be returned to Whitehall and reconnected with his former long-term partner Bough, who will be played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the captain of the submarine, where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So the disgrace of Batman and Robin, his Majesty's secret service, is back on the line, meeting Olga Körölienko's beautiful femme for the fate of Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is going down a dangerously charismatic tech-military. He claims that he is able to solve all British computer failures: poor Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their thrilling odyssey: by hiding themselves as waiters, they put on fire to the French restaurant; they create chaos, sweep secretly on Volta's luxury hunting; and English starts a real confusion when he tries to use the headset of virtual reality to get to know the inside of Volta's house.
In this last section, no brakes are used, but as sweet and hurricane as it is, the whole thing has a child's TV makeup.
It's all middle stuff.
And, as with other films in Johnny English, I thought of myself: does the British film industry really have no role to play for Rowan Atkinson, which would be fair to his talent?
The Work Party denies the drafting of a plan where the British work four days a week, but they are paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn Work Party has considered a major plan, which provides that the British work four days a week, but they are paid five days ago.
The party would like the company's heads to transfer savings to employees from the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) by giving them one additional day off.
That's how employees would have a three-day weekend, but they'll get the same salary.
According to the source, this idea would be compatible with the Party's economic agenda and so the country will be diverted to the benefit of workers.
The Thursday working week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress so that workers can benefit from changing economies.
The Work Party’s source said to The Sunday Times: “It is expected that the revision of the draft will be announced before the end of the year.
“This does not take place overnight, but the Thursday working week is a effort that is compatible with the party's approach to balancing the economy, both in the interests of workers and in the general industrial strategy of the Party.
The Work Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a Thursday week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the Work Party as a whole does not currently support this effort.
The press representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day week of work is not a party's policy and the party will not discuss it.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell used the Work Party conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist turn in the economy.
McDonnell said that he had decided to withdraw power from the “experienced managers” and “professional servants” of the communal companies.
The plans of the Deputy Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not be able to recover all their shares, as the Work Party could do “decreasingly” in relation to the perceived misconduct.
He confirmed his plan to put employees in the company's boards and to create ownership funds to give 10% of private companies' equity to employees instead of giving annual bonuses of up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about "60 Minutes", whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation can change their minds.
The investigation of the charges brought by the FBI against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on candidates for the Riigikogu by at least one week and raises the question of whether the Office's findings could influence the cessation of the republic senators' support.
In a Sunday interview, you will be entitled to "60 Minutes" co-director Scott Pelley's republic senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asking if the FBI could reveal anything that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Naturally," said Kennedy.
“ I said I'd go to the interrogation, and I said I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called her after the charges came out and said, "Did you do that?"
He was decisive, firm and unambiguous."
Graham's voice seems clammy.
“I'm sure in my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and can only be changed in the bombs,” he said.
“Dr Ford, I don’t know how this happened, but I know that Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone he has called could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see anything new coming."
What is the Global Citizens Festival worldwide and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
On this Saturday, a annual music event will be organised by the New York Global Citizen Festival, which has an impressive share of celebrities and the same impressive goal: to eliminate poverty from the world.
Now the seventh-time Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn not only enjoying singers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real purpose of the event, namely the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a global poverty project, a group of international lawyers who hope to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people who fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you do not wish to pay for the VIP ticket), concert replies had to carry out a number of tasks or voluntary activities, send e-mail to some world leader, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of losing poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it is still 12 years to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert is a real way to convince them to act, or is it just another click, where people feel that they are doing something important by signing an application online or sneaking?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “acts” of its supporters in seeking to achieve a number of different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than 37 billion dollars of commitments and policies affecting more than 2.25 billion people's lives by 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group referred to the 390 commitments and notifications resulting from their activities and of which at least EUR 10 billion has already been paid or funded.
The Group considers that the funds covered have still been directly affected by around 649 million people worldwide.
The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to "helping children to exploit all their abilities", permits Rwanda to give $35 million in order to help the country stop underestimation after receiving more than 4700 crayons from Global Citizens.
“ With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens such as you, we can turn underestimation into a historical footnote of social injustice," said Ambassador Tracey Ullman of Nutrition to the people of London during the concert in April 2018.
The group also informed that after more than 5000 activities that called on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing project The Power of Nutrition, reaching the 5 million women and children required to intervene in the nutrition area.
In response to one of the FAQ's websites asking: “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied: “This is a long and difficult road - sometimes we fall and fail.
However, as we face great civil rights and anti-partite movements, we are confident of our success, as we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is just a couple of performers who come up for this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy's "barrière" to prevent Russia's energy export - Minister of Interior
According to Washington Examiner, Washington may use its Navy if necessary to avoid hitting the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, the U.S. Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke has published.
Zinke argued that Russia's participation in Syria, especially if it operates on the invitation of a legitimate government, is an excuse for investigating new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to intermediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the southern European stomach,” he allegedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States of America has this opportunity by means of our Marines to ensure that maritime lines are open and blocked, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go on the market," he added.
Zinke’s statement was turned on to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, which is a non-profit association which represents the "vote of the energy user" in the USA.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that they are essentially the same.
“The economic choice of Iraq and Russia is more or less, leverage and fuel replacement," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one trick pony" whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements will come at a time when the Trump Government is responsible for increasing the export of LNG to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump Administration, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are attempting to persuade Germany to reject the ‘inappropriate’ Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a Moscow prisoner.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of EUR 11 billion, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s acute opposition to the project has simply been motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of expressing pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said the Russian Minister for Energy Aleksandr Novak at a meeting in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, U.S. Energy Minister.
The U.S. attitude has become a backfire from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German leading industrial organisation, the German Labour Association (BDI) called on the US to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a major problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industrial Union (BDI) after the recent meeting of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering a presidential candidate in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that he would seriously consider candidateing for presidential elections during the intermittent elections.
At Holyoke's Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his appointment.
“ It is time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, and this includes the first lady, ” he said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'm seriously considering candidateing for president."
Warren also assessed President Donald Trump’s activities at the Rae House, saying that he ‘ would take the country in the wrong direction.
“I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy, ” he said.
Warren has published criticism in the direction of Trump and his High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said: "We need a FBI investigation before we vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters do not think that it should be candidates in 2020.
According to the University of Suffolk political research centre/Boston Globe survey, 58% of the "probable" voters of Massachusetts thought that the senator should not be candidateed.
32% supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidateship, 38% supported potential candidates, and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in relation to potential candidates for 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that he would formally decide by January, announced Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Donald Trump's meeting Track Palin PTSD
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after the recruitment of September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with domestic violence and was charged.
“ What my son will live through, what he will experience when he comes back, I will be able to link myself with other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers will return, ” he told the audience at Donald Trump’s meeting in Tulsa octaham.
Palin called the arrest of his son in the “elephant room” and said in connection with his son and other war veterans that “they would come back a little differently, they would come back as they were furnished, and they would come back and wonder if there was enough respect for what the soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers gave to the state.”
He was arrested on Monday, a press representative of the police department in Alaska and Wasilla, Dan Bennett, who said he was charged with domestic violence against women, interference in the home violence report and the possession of a gun in a drunk state.
18 states and the Columbia region challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the Columbia region support a legal challenge for a new US policy that prohibits asylum for victims who flee from gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday, 18 countries and regional representatives submitted a brief statement by their judges in Washington to support the challenging policy related to the asylum seeker, NBC News announced.
The full name of the applicant Grace v Sessions smoked by the American Civil Liberties Association in August against Union policy has not been published.
She said that her partner, “and her violent gangster sons” abused her, but the US officials did not accept her asylum application on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
National lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries producing a large number of US asylum seekers, including gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed the decision of the Appeal Board for Immigrants in 2014, which allowed immigrants without documents to flee from domestic violence for asylum applications.
In a Friday statement, Karl Racine, the General Prosecutor of the Columbia region, said that the new policy “is ignoring national, Union and international law for decades”.
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be resolved in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a requirement violates this principle," said the brief statement of the judges.
In a brief statement, the lawyers also claimed that the ban on entry of immigrants would affect the US economy, saying that they would probably become entrepreneurs and “the necessary labour force”.
Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the Immigration Courts in June to no longer give refuge to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
“The request for asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear in relation to race, religion, nationality or certain social groups or political opinions," said Sessions in its communication of 11 June.
The purpose of the asylum was never to mitigate all the problems, even all the serious problems that people face every day.
Fascinating Rescue Operations in a Request where deaths have doubled in the fight to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly threatening.
“ The situation is very tense, ” said Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, who comforted her little boy in his fever at the evacuation center of the town of Palu.
“ Every minute, new people will arrive with an ambulance.
There's not enough water to clean."
The inhabitants returned to their ruined homes by sorting out the things they had moved and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by 7.5-magnitude earthquakes were overloaded.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder arm, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were continued to be treated in the field due to severe follow-ups.
Her tears filled her eyes when she recalled how a strong earthquake shook her hotel room at the fifth floor, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
“I hadn't had time to save myself.
I think I was pushed into the ruins against the wall," said Haris Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“ I heard my wife screaming to help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger."
The U.S. Ambassador blames China for being bullyed by "work advertising"
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published under the U.S. daily news about the mutual daily benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador accused Peking in China of the use of American press to spread propaganda.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, referred to the addition paid by China Daily last Wednesday in Des Moines Register - Iowa's biggest newspaper - after China was accused of interference in the elections of the United States Congress on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the U.S. elections marked what the U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington's enlarging campaign to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in the growing commercial war where the import tariffs are adjusted.
The anti-Chinese anti-dumping measures at the beginning of the tariff war were intended to capture the States such as Iowa exporters, as they supported the Trump Republicans parties, have been explained by Chinese and US experts.
The US Ambassador in China and the former governor of Iowa, as well as the largest exporter of agricultural products in China, Terry Branstad, said that Beijing affected American workers, farmers and companies.
Branstad wrote in a Sunday Des Moines Register opinion article: “Chinese has now doubled its harassment by publishing the work ads in our free press.”
“The Chinese government uses expensive freedom of expression and free press practice in its own propaganda by putting its costly advertising in the Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
“On the other hand, there are only limited voices in the streets of Beijing, and it does not see a truly different opinion of the Chinese people on the worrying economic direction of China, given that the media are under the strong hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he added.
He added that one of the most prominent newspapers in China refused to publish his article, but he did not say what kind of newspaper it was.
Analysts warn us that the Republicans will alienate female electorates before the interim elections with Kavanaugh's fiasco.
While many Republicans are waiting and defending the Supreme Court's candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of several sexual attacks, analysts have warned that they will see a retreat during the forthcoming interim elections, especially from women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been at the ceiling, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to go on voting.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at the Maxwell University of Syracuse University, in a article published on Saturday to The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last minute's attempt of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) in connection with the investigation of the FBI is sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“The women do not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said the senior consultant of the MoveOn progressive group and the national representative, Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC, on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters repeated “November is coming!” during their demonstration in the Senate corridor, since the republics who supervise the judges’ committees decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s candidateship, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, reported Mic.
“Democratic Independence and Insider Resistance begin to remain out of schedule," said Stu Rothenberg, an informal political analyst to the news site.
“ People say it is already high, it is true.
However, it may be higher, especially among the female voters in the outskirts and the younger voters in the ages of 18 to 24, who are often disliked by the President and often abstained."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which described his claims of sexual assault on the candidate of the Riigikogu, analysts predicted a relapse when the Republicans proceed with the confirmation.
“This has become very confusing for the GOP” said Michael Steele NBC News, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of the last week.
“This does not only concern the Commission's vote, the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh is being appointed, it also concerns how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated him,” led the Head of the United States (the group to help the Democrats to choose) to the attention of Guy Cec on the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be slightly divided, who believes after the testimony in Ford and who is Kavanaugh, but with a little more support for the first.
YouGov's new survey showed that 41% of respondents certainly believed or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% said that they certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they think Kavanaugh has probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is now investigating Ford's allegations and at least another charge of Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford confessed last week to the Senate Judges Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Riigikogu showed him his genitals when they attended a party in Yale during the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor intends to start a new internet that will breeze with Google and Facebook
The World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee launched a starter company trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of a technology legend Inrupt is a company that builds Berners-Lee open source code platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exceptional interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made fun of the intention of Inrupt to “government of the world”.
"We must do this now," he said about the starter company.
"This is an historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their "personal online database" or POD.
It may include contact lists, task lists, calendars, music collections and other personal and competent tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which is all available in one browser and at the same time.
This personal online database makes it unique to enable the user to choose who can access this information.
The company refers to it as “the provision of individual powers through data”.
According to the company manager John Bruce, Inrupt is the idea of bringing the company sources, processes and relevant skills to help Solid make it available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM purchased security platforms, some developers who have been hired to work on the project under a contract, and the Volunteer Code community.
From this week on, technology developers can regain their decentralised applications using the resources available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google to bring in a total change if all their business models are fully supported overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post published on Saturday in the Media, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's aim is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid."

Bernard Vann: the crusade of the crucifixed clergy of Victoria was opened in World War I
The only church in England crossed during World War I was the 100th anniversary of his hometown.
Lieutenant General Bernard Vann fought his mark out on September 29, 1918 during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he died through a sniper's bullet and did not know he had received the highest British Army mark.
His two grandsons opened a memorial stone on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said that it would be “genially symbolic ” if the stone was opened exactly 100 years after the great fight of his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, the colonel Lieutenant Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918 “through a very thick mist of japanese and a bullet gun of machine guns.”
Later, he rushed into the attack line and then moved it to the “maximum galantitude ” before he, alone, rushed to one of the machine gunners and knocked three opponents unconscious.
On October 4th, 1918, the German sniper, when the end of the war was only a few more than a month left.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather was “something I know I can never repeat, but for which I will always be grateful for. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, put a parade on the back after the Brentwood Coning band.
Michael Vann said that he had “a great privilege to participate in this parade ” and added that “the presence and support of so many people shows that a true hero is appreciated.”
The MMA fans were Bellator 206 to look up all night, but they only saw Peppa in Pig.
Imagine you've been up all night to watch Bellator 206, but you're not even showing this basic event.
San Jose's match included 13 fights, including six main cards, and was shown in the United Kingdom on channel 5 throughout the night in direct transfer.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to pour each other in the chest, the UK viewers left their mouths with a cupcake, because Peppa appeared on the screen in Põrsa.
Many were not enthusiastic about this, especially those who had remained awake until early hours to see this battle.
One fan described the transition to a children's comic on Twitter as a "sick joke".
“This is government regulation that the content was no longer suitable at 6:00 and had to be switched to the children’s program,” explained Dave Schwartz, the senior Vice-President of Bellator on marketing and communication issues when the transfer was asked.
"The Pig Peppa," yes."
President Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they are going to work on drawing up their timetables to take more account of UK viewers in the future.
“ When I think about the replay, I think we can solve this problem in the future, ” said Coker.
“But if it's 6:00 a.m. in the morning, we can't do it until our Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was modified, there were a lot of back and forth texts, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical disorder.
But it wasn't, it was a government rule.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We'll show a reference instead of six fights - as we usually do - to the fans we tried to offer more, and we just went over in time.
It's a naughty situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "sexy" about sexuality
Tom Daley, the Olympic winner, says that he grew up to feel that he was more valuable than others because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old young man said he didn't understand until high school went out, "No one is like him."
By participating in Lauren Laverne Radio 4 broadcasting Desert Island Discs, he said he was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
When he became a parent, he also changed his view of winning the Olympic Games, giving him the feeling that it was no longer so important.
You will receive the usual long-term escort manager Kirsty Young had to take a few months off due to his disease.
In Laverne's first show, Daley told me that she felt less valuable when she grew up than others because it wasn't socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
“ Until today, ” he said, “the feelings that I am not worthy and that I feel different, gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove he was worth nothing, and he didn't disappoint others when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double bronx-Ilympiad winner has become the leader of the highly valued LGBT campaign, using his release to the National Community Games of this year in Australia, to turn to more countries for the decriminalisation of homosexuality.
He said he would talk about it because he has been lucky that he could live openly without the consequences, and he wanted to give hope to others.
The triple world champion said that the love for a man - the US film artist Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - was “a surprise to him.”
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but she said that the age difference has never been a problem.
"If you're going through so much when you're young," he went to his first Olympic games when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later, it was hard to find someone the same old who had experienced similar rises and joys.
A couple of parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his “whole prospect” has changed.
“ If you had asked me last year, everything was related to winning the golden medal, ” he said.
“But you know, there are more important things than the gold medals of the Olympics.
"My Olympia gold medal is Robbie."
His son received his name after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age, after diagnosis of brain tumours.
Daley said that his father did not agree to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, "Daddy, you can't sit in the front row, because by the time you're gone," he said.
“ I kept his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually finished breathing and died, I finally admitted that he was not invincible, ” he said.
Next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“ I just knew that it was what I had dreamed my whole life to dive in front of the household crowd in the Olympic Games, ” he said.
It also inspired his first song option - Heather Small Proud - which helped him prepare for the Olympic Games and still creates chicken skin.

Out of the form, Mickelson was removed on Saturday at Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson makes a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to fix his form to avoid miserable milestones.
Mickelson, who plays a record 12 times every two years at the event, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for a Saturday couple and a four-ball.
Instead of being at the center of action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner divided his day into two, being a cheerleader and working on his game in the hope of improving it.
Never the most direct hitter, even at the top of his career, is not suitable for a 48-year-old to play a narrow Le Golf National golf course, where a long hard track is punishing continuously lost hits.
And if the square isn't scary enough, Mickelson will stand on Sunday, in his ninth competition, face the exact British Open master Francesco Molinar, who has joined the power with the original Tommy Fleetwood to win all his four races this week.
If Americans, who are behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single games, start warmly, Mickelson’s competition may be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he didn't have much more to add.
“ He fully understood his part today, stabbed me on my shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow, ” added Furyk.
“ He is very confident.
He's famous and he's given so much to our teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I saw more than that, but that's how it went, and we had to choose a way like that.
He wants to be out, like everyone else."
Mickelson passes the Nick Faldo record on Sunday as the most Ryder Cup players.
It may celebrate the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never responded to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven fictions, but Furyk said that his presence has given the team a further spiritual contribution.
“ He is funny, mocking, funny, he likes to have fun with people, and he is just great in the crew room, ” he explained.
“ I think the younger players had fun and it was nice to see when they went against him this week.
He offers much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advance will soon be lost
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his own experience that the great leadership of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become an unpleasant experience at the beginning of individual games.
During the 1997 competition in Valderram, where, together with Captain Seve Ballesteros, the Americans held five-point predecessors, but when they reached the finish line, it was drasticly decreased, only with a result of 141⁄2 : 131⁄2.
“You even recall that we had a great lead in Valderram; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderram, where we won very little,” said Bjorn in the picture after Class of 2018 5 : 3 Friday and yesterday with success 10 : 6 Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole team that it could happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points.
We have a goal that is to win a cup, so we will focus on it.
I've been telling you all the time, focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of who our opponents are, the best players in the world."
Being satisfied with the way his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I will not rush into things.
Tomorrow is a whole new obstacle.
Tomorrow, personal performances will be counted, and so it's something else.
It's nice to be with the counter player if things go well, but if you're there personally, you'll be fully tested as a golf player.
It's a message you have to send to the players - do your best tomorrow.
Now that you leave your partner, he'll have to go and do it himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk expects his players to act personally better than with counter players, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both in these last days, being part of Brookline's victory team, before becoming part of the defeat when Europe defeated the Medinah miracle.
“I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put all their games on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start in a hot way, like Brookline and Medinahis.
If the attack goes in one direction, it will exert a lot of pressure on the average competitions.
Let's set our team up and put the boys on the field in a way we feel that this is how a miracle can be born tomorrow."
Thomas has been given a job to try to run the competition and he is the best match with Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the competition.
“ I put my boys in a line like this because I think we're well covered in this way, ” said Bjorn about his choice of single games.
Germany's new warship re-entered
The German Navy's latest high-speed fleet should have come in 2014, replacing old-fashioned warships, but this would not happen before the next year due to the cost of injurious systems and snowball, the local media reported.
The introduction of the new ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ flagship of the Baden-Wuertmann Class has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 in accordance with the military press release published in the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrying post-transfer problems did not make this ambitious project easy.
Four ships of Baden-Wuertmberg Class, which the Navy ordered in 2007, replace the old Bremen class’s fast sailors.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-air and ship missiles and some concealing technologies, such as the reduction of radar, infrared and hearing signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest fasteners should be able to be dispatched from home for up to two years.
However, late delays mean that top-level warships - which allow Germany to strengthen power abroad - are already ageing by the time they are in service.
The failing F125 high-speed ships appeared in the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Shipyard Bloohm & Voss.
This was the first time the Navy sent the ship back to the ship builder since he got it.
There was little knowledge of the causes of return, but the German media quoted a number of major "software and hardware shortcomings", which made the warship unsuitable if they were used in the battle mission.
The lack of software was particularly important because Baden-Württemberg class ships are managed by a team of about 120 sailors - only half of the older Bremen class's fast sailors.
It has also shown that the ship is considerably overweight, reducing its performance and restricting the capacity of the Navy to include future innovations.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighing 7000 tonnes is probably twice the same class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the team, becomes a problem.
It has been said that it will reach EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) - compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the newer high-speed fleet will become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's marine capacity will decrease.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the Defence Commission of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Navy has actually “exportable ships ceased.”
The official said that this topic has grown as a snowball over time because the old ships were removed, but no replacement ships came.
He regretted that none of the fast sailors in Baden-Wuertmann's class could join the Navy.
National Trust is investigating the secret life of bats
The aim of a new study in the highland of Scotland is to reveal how bats use the landscape to find their food.
It is hoped that the results will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to direct future protective measures.
Research from the National Trust in Scotland monitors the traditional and soprano peppers in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross, as well as the brown long ears and the daubenton leather mouse.
Special recorders shall be placed in the main locations of the area to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also carry out field studies using hand-held sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings determines the frequency of bats and the activity of species.
The map and report of habitats will then be created to create a detailed landscape image of their behaviour.
The NTS Nature Protection Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will show which habitats are the most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information helps to determine the benefits of the management of habitats, such as the creation of grassland and the best way to preserve forests for batteries and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole, the fattening of bats has fallen considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting their habitats and its loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flying papers and chemical treatment of some construction materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
Leather mice aren't really blind.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful in catching the harvest than their eyes.
They use complex echo-industrial techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
Over 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land in the whole country, the NTS takes the bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, surveys and sometimes save.
The organization has even created the first and only special bat reserve in Scotland in the area of Threave in Dumfrie and Galloway, where eight of the ten bat species of Scotland live.
The real estate manager David Thompson says this area is the perfect territory for them.
"In threave we have a large area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and a great place to live.
But there's still a lot to find about the bats, so the work we do here and in other areas will help us to understand better what they need."
He stresses the importance of checking bats before starting maintenance in the real estate, since the undesirable destruction of a single birth and childbirth can kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
Leather mice are protected and killing, harassing or destroying them is illegal.
The Scottish officer Elisabeth Ferrell of the Fleet Protection Union has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how many of our species and how their deserts feed.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers are planning to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected the accusations of rape against him as a "now news" saying that people “will promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue charges published in the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping the American sister Kathryn Mayorga in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He has allegedly paid 330 643,10 euros to the woman to keep her from talking about the incident, Der Spiegel announced on Friday.
In the direct video of Instagram, after half an hour after the charges, Ronaldo (33) reported that it was “now news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What we're talking about today is in the fake news," said five times Ballon d'Or winner to the news.
They want to promote themselves by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and I'm fine," added the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, the attorneys of Ronaldo prepare for the appeal to Der Spiegel in relation to the ‘notification of undue suspicion in respect of privacy’.
The lawyer, Christian Schertz, said that the player seeks compensation for “moral damage that corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged case took place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayor allegedly went back to the hotel room, where he was allegedly raped according to the Clark County District District District Court of Nevada on the basis of the documents submitted.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged case and told him that he was a “99 percent good man ” of whom“ one percent fails. ”
Documents say Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual relations, but it wasn't unanimous.
Mayor also claims that he went to the police and took photographs of injury in the hospital, but later agreed to an outlaw solution because he was afraid of "hand tax" and was worried about "public humiliation".
Now, a 34-year-old woman says that she is now trying to reverse the solution, because the alleged case continues to trauma her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Italy with a giant Juve transaction of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The U.S. can begin to regret the departure of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom would “two forever” if he lost his position as head of the world's automotive industry after Brexit, said the Secretary of Business, Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota U.S. had told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop their production in the factory near Derby in Burnaston.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the stoppings of the border crossing without the Brexit agreement could pay jobs.
The Burnaston factory, where vehicles are manufactured in Toyota Auri and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that when Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a stop in the production process in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Burnaston Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared leaving the EU without agreement, having concerns about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that he closes the Mini plant in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to the risks of the supply chain in the absence of Brexit agreement.
Toyota production line works where necessary, where spare parts arrive from both the United Kingdom and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement concluded on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, may cause delays and shortcomings.
Toyota wouldn't be able to keep its Derbyshire plant in stock for more than one day, so the production needs to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers' plan in relation to future EU relations has been "precisely calibrated to avoid such controls at the border."
“We need an agreement. We want the best solution that would enable us to do what we want, and not only use the current success, but the full opportunity to do it,” he said BBC Radio 4 for Today.
“The facts not only about Toyota, but also about other producers indicate that we must continue what has been a very successful supply chain set.”
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but in the long term, it warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately also pay jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a representative of the Unite trade union, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from our experience that when the jobs disappear, they will not come back.
The government press representative said: “We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could delay again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's big-time meeting with Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week, since the fight against Highest Candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, announced the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who is investigating the intervention of Russian elections, the link between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the possible obstacles to the President's justice.
Whether Trump is firing the Deputy Prosecutor of Prosecutor and thus jeopardising Mueller's independence, he's been putting on Washington's rumors for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed the use of listening devices to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the President through amendment 25.
Rosenstein didn't confirm it.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, telling me he was going to step back.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, who was then in New York at the United Nations.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence with the interrogation of the Senate judges' committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, gave both identities.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, deferring the Senate's vote.
The Trump Press Representative Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday at the news channel Fox News.
When he was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date is not yet set, it may be this week, but it may be delayed by another week, taking into account all the things in connection with the Supreme Court.
But let's look at it and keep the press informed, as always."
Some journalists would object to this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Captain Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders said that the lack of information hours was not due to the deliberate disappointment of TV journalists, although he added: “I do not object to the fact that they have been disappointed.”
Then he suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president makes more questions and answers sessions than any president before him," he said, without adding evidence: “We have looked at these numbers.”
The information hours continue, confirmed by Sanders, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this a lot, and you have seen how we have done this in the past few weeks, so it will take place at the time of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump will regularly answer questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, before the gathered journalists were in front of the public, and sometimes with a strange appearance .
The Minister for Health wrote to EU staff in NHS Scotland about Brexit’s fears
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude and wishing to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter when the United Kingdom has remained less than six months until its exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of its established status for EU citizens working in public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “The summer has continued negotiations on the resignation of the United Kingdom to the EU, heading towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK Government has also prepared a possible non-conventional scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
Companies from the EU and elsewhere provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit our patients and communities.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie passed through the emergency surgery after the head trauma.
The supporter of Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was performing an extraordinary surgery after the head injury and defeat on Saturday 31 : 27 Vanderbilt Commodores, published by Tennessee Mike Organ.
Head coach Rod Reed, Tennessee State, told the journalists that the injury just happened before Polish time.
“ He fell on his side and just fell apart," said Reed.
Trainers and medical professionals gave Abercrombie oxygen while on his side, before he was placed on the carrier frame for further inspection from the field.
The Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie's operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center has ended.
Harris added that there are no details of the type/interest of injury yet, and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
With a red shirt, the second year student Abercrombie was in Tennessee State during his first season after the overcoming from Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before he left the game, which made a total of 18 fights during this season.
Foreigners will have to pay higher stamp tax when buying real estate in Britain
Foreigners will have to pay a higher stamp tax if they buy real estate in the United Kingdom using this extra money to assist homeless people on the basis of new Tory plans
This step will disarm Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The stamp tax is taxable on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will create up to 120 million pounds per year to assist homeless people.
Foreigners will have to pay higher rates of temple tax when they buy real estate in the United Kingdom using this extra money to assist homeless people today, Theresa May announced.
Movement is considered to be an attempt to disarm Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young electorates by pledging to offer them affordable housing and target high-income people.
The stamp tax is taxing individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the United Kingdom by directing additional money to the government's desire to combat homelessness.
The additional fee - which is in addition to this temple tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago to another home and to the purchases related to the future - may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will generate up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's purchased depots belong to non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first buyers to reach their feet when buying housing.
Many of the wealthy regions of the country, especially in the capital, have become “fucking cities”, thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
A new policy will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the temple tax to help young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping high real estate prices when buying land but not using it, and invited May to give up the quotas for affordable homes in order to improve the UK’s “residential disgrace”.
Corbyn has announced a spectacular reform of the residential economy, including rental control and the closure of the innocence of innocent people.
It also wishes to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
May said: “ Last year I promised as Prime Minister that I would commit myself to the restoration of the British dream - that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live here, work and build their own lives here.
At the same time, it is right for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies abroad, to buy homes as for British people who have a lot of work.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too far away, and the tough conditions of sleeping are the usual reality."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland"
The head of Sunderlan, Jack Ross, says that his “definite purpose” is to be the leader of Scotland at some point.
Scotland (42) welcomes the challenge of revitalising the North-East club, currently in the League One, with only three points behind it.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after he had taken St Mirren back to the League of Scots during the last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to class B, and it's limited," said Ross BBC Scotland show at Sportsound.
“But I grew up with my father, looking at Scotland in the Hampden, and that is always something that has dragged me back.
But this option only comes if I'm successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland have been Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletici says that he had no fear of such great and well-known names, having previously endured both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"It's a success for me at the moment that I can take this club to the League of Masters."
Because of its structure and facilities, this club certainly belongs to the League of Masters," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I see myself as successful only if I manage to take the club back there."
Ross has only been a leader for three years, being formerly Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months among Hearts’ leading staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the fall to the third level and made St Mirren's lowest position the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now when he was in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy during his career.
“ This was a real crossroad, ” recalled Alloa’s takeover.
“I really believed that management would be more suitable for me than playing.
It seems weird because I did it, I got a reasonable income, and I enjoyed some of the best moments.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot to do every week.
I still experience it in view of the tension and pressure of my work, but the management just seems more right.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable now than ever when I was grown up."

Summer heat has improved the turnover of pubs in British distress, but more pressure has arisen on restaurants.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the restaurants' turnover fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of CGA’s business consulting company, Peter Martin, said: “The longer part of the world championships and England’s expected participation meant that July was similar to June when pub turnover increased by 2.8 per cent, except that the restaurants went even more difficult.
In June, sales of 1.8% reduced restaurants deteriorated further in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars traded most successful and try to enjoy restaurants the worst.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, although not as dramatic as well as restaurant managers.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sales of beverages between the controlled pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent during the month while the sale of food decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, analyst of leisure time and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The impact of weather and major social or sporting events remains the greatest factor in selling outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although sales declined by 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year is particularly painful in addition to the current price pressure.
Long and hot summer would not have come at a worse time for food business operators, and only time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August are somewhat necessary relief."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of trade mark-related authorities.
The sales monitor of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry in the United Kingdom's pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses the performance data of 47 groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and represents a benchmark for the developed industry.
One of the five children has secret social media accounts that they hide for their parents
The study concluded that one of the five children, some of whom are 11 years old, has secret social media accounts that they hide for their parents and teachers.
A study conducted in 20 000 Gymnasists showed an increase in the "neps Insta" pages
News increased fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "base account" to show their parents
The study concluded that one of the five children, some of them only 11 years old, creates secret social media accounts that they hide for adults.
A study conducted among 20 000 Gymnasists found a significant increase in the accounts of the Insta (reference to the Instagram page for the distribution of images).
The news increased the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said that they had both a basic account for showing their parents as well as an acceptable account.
One of his 13-year-old daughter's secret page found that a teenager invited others to rape.
Digital Awareness UK and private school association Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and half of them recognised the existence of personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of the HMC, said: “It's annoying to see that so many teenagers are attracted to the creation of accounts on the Internet where parents and teachers can't find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be a spokesperson at the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-professional manager at the Scottish Athletics Board’s annual meeting.
Doyle is the most favorable light force player in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie described the events as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his broad international experience in the last decade.
“Elidih is respected everywhere in Scotland, the U.S.C. and other athletes, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit from calling his board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I want to be the spokesperson of the sports of the sports of Scotland, and I hope I can actually contribute to its development."
The American who won four Olympic Golds at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, 200 metres and 400 metres, and now often shares his opinion in the BBC, was unable to walk after the transitory ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I was shocked.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that if I'm going to be back, and if that's to what extent, it's only time.
I've done a rough job, but I've completely recovered, learned to walk again, and I'm already doing speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertising, which compares women to cows, divides the Internet into two.
The bowel pump company has distributed the Internet with two camps advertising, which compares the breast-feeding mother’s milky cows.
According to the stories, the consumer technology company Elvie published a similar advertisement for the world’s first silent breast pump to present the freedom that this new pump gives out to the craving mothers.
Four real mothers dance with hay in a table full of cows and sing, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see my tail" and "If you didn't notice, they're not larvas, they're my breasts."
The verse repeats: “Pumpa, pump, I feed children, pump, pump, I fill my ladies with milk.”
However, advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has created controversial opinions on the Internet.
77 000 times viewed and thousands of commentary video viewers have disagreed. Many of them say that it illuminates the milk industry's tents.
“The use of cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and be born for milk production, but the difference is that children are stolen from them in the days they read after birth," wrote one.
Elvie breast pump does not strangle the breast breast-feeding holder in the eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentator said: “It seems to be traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why don't you use these kids to promote the breast pump of mothers who can keep them?"
Someone added, "A completely unhappy ad."
It's part of the ad, and one woman thought it was very fun.
“I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I still had breast-feeding.
Pumping milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertisement's a little crazy, but let's take it as it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
The second commented: “This is a fun advertising for women who are pumping and feeling themselves like cows (often in their jobs or toilets).
This advertising does not praise and condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they've all danced in bras with non-significant pumps.
The idea of a campaign is based on the fact that many women pumping breast milk feel like a cow.
However, Elvie Pump is completely quiet, no wires, no pipes, and no eye for a breastfeeding woman, giving women the freedom to move, keep children, and even go outside while pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that deserved a bold and irritating introduction.
With a comparison of women's expression opportunities and milk cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while presenting in the entertainment and familiar key the extraordinary liberty of the new pump.
This isn't the first time the news has shown Elvie's pump.
On the London fashion week, the mother of two children carrying the product of Marta Jakubowski appeared on the stage.
Thousands of children of migrants went quietly to camp at the Texas border.
The number of children of imprisoned migrants has risen sharply, although monthly crossing has remained quite the same. Particularly due to the fact that the Trump Administration has enforced harsh rhetoric and policies have made the establishment of children difficult with the help of sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are immigrants with documents and have been afraid to violate the possibility of residency in their country, so that the child’s right of care is required.
The risk increased in June when national authorities announced that possible sponsors and other household adults could submit fingerprints and data are shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, Senior Officer for Immigration and Customs Organisation, admitted to the Congress last week that the Agency arrested a dozen people who requested financial support for unaccompanied minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested persons lacked a criminal past.
“After 80% of sponsors or members of the sponsor's household are illegally present in the country and a large number of them are criminally backgrounds.
So we're going to keep track of them," said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal with the children faster, officials put in place new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest.
Many defend their legal content before the judge of immigration by a video conference, to come in.
The inadmissibles are sent out of the country quickly.
According to asylum workers, and on the basis of the reports published in recent months, the longer the child is in custody, the more likely they become nervous or depressed, which may cause violent demonstrations or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more actuarial in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where the child’s difficulty can be missed by the size of the child.
They added that moving children to the tent city without leaving enough time to get used to feeling used to or to say goodbye to friends could cause trauma, and many are already in trouble.
Syria demands the immediate departure of the U.S., French and Turkish occupational forces.
The Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, invited Syrian refugees to come home at the UN General Assembly, even though the country has been in war for the eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian surface on the grounds of terrorism and are dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally,” he said in the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the Syrian “terror war is almost over.” Since 2011, more than 360 000 people have died and millions of their homes have left.
He said that Damascus will continue “to fight in this saint war until we have cleaned the entire Syrian territory” from both terrorist groups and “any outside force that is illegally present.”
The United States of America has about 2 000 forces in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish units and Syrian Arabs, who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
In France there are more than 1,000 forces in a war - wrecked country.
Speaking of the issue of war refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return are appropriate and he blamed the fears of unreasonable, preventing the coming of refugees in part of the Western countries.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help their faces, ” he said.
"They politize something that is just a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted recovery aid until the war between Assad and the opposition has ended.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates the last rebel base of the Idlib buffer zone, has created an opportunity for progress in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a wide range of Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province of three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement contains “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action would hit the warriors of the jihads, including Al-Qaeda, who would be “destructed”.
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura will soon hope to persuade the new committees of government and opposition members to design the post-war Syrian Constitution and pave the way for election.
Moualem made demands for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current Constitution and warned against intervention.
Why Trump is also selected for the second term
According to this logic, Trump could be won at the next elections in 2020, if the resignation and the scandal have not previously completed his presidential office, as probably the liberal viewers want.
Which would undoubtedly be “the most exciting end of the President’s office! ”
At the moment, the viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, top-hour ratings have doubled over 1,05 million in CNN and nearly 1,6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, on average 2,4 million viewers have been present in Fox News. Compared to the four-year viewers, their number has risen. MSNBC shows the Rachel Maddow Show with 3.5 million cables, the viewer has kept this rating high during the main evening news.
“This is the tension we are involved in because we do not understand it,” said ABC Drama Head of Designed Survivor on the Secretary of Government, who will be President when the attack destroys the parliamentary building.
Nell Scovell, who has experienced comedy writer and the book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a second theory.
He remembers the cab ride before the 2016 elections in Boston.
The leader told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
“He said he was making me laugh," Mrs. Scovell mentioned to me.
All this chaos has some entertainment value.
Of course, not as other news on TV, Washington’s rumors can be fatal to the future of Roe v Wade and reunited with the desired immigrant families and the global economy.
Aside from the subject is only the luxury of viewers in a preferential position.
However, the six-hour talks of Bob Woodward’s "basic background research" for his book "Fear" and Paul Manafort 13 225.73€ from the money-paid jam Bomber (washington Post said about this, the viewer is more than a trained citizen.
For example, I'll never watch Super Mario with the same feeling again.
“One of his activities, which may seem to be a reality series, is that he shares something every night,” said the executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator Brent Montgomery Trump's performance with the intermediary actors and day-to-day plan (with NFL, Kim Jong-un to be praised).

At Fleiss this week, his home was 80 degrees warm on the north shore of Kauai, but he had folded into the room to look at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't give up watching Brett Kavanaugh deal with the Senate's Justice Committee and how the destiny of the Supreme Court hangs on his hair.
“I remember how we did all kinds of crazy shows at our time, and people said that this was the beginning of the end of the Western civilization," said Mr Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Somewhere else, cash flows are moving to the most acute White House interim selection.
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives the cash flow through the restructuring of the Congress area, by obtaining two dominant companies to the same place.
As a result, Conor Lamb from the Democratic Republic of Pittsburg was re-elected in the frontier number of the front city, which won the second district of the previous spring extraordinary elections.
Lamb's opposite candidate is the Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in the largest section of the new 17.
The cards were changed after the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January, and thus the old divisions were divided into anti-constitutional electoral regions, favouring the Republicans.
The new 17th elections have released a campaign where the financial departments of the largest political parties – the Democratic campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican campaign National Committee (NRCC) with money.
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania, shortly after the victory of a lot of viewed March in Pennsylvania in the 18th conventional districts of extraordinary elections.
This place has been the Republican for decades, and President Donald Trump won in district 20 points.
Political opinion holders have given the Democrats a small advantage.
In the United States, El Salvador was punished for supporting China, and then retired
Diplomates noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama already acknowledged Beijing, a small retreat to Washington.
Mr Trump met in a friendly atmosphere in June 2017 with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners threw Trump's company out.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back the American leaders of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, because Heather Nauert, the press representative of the Ministry, said earlier this month that these countries had recently ceased to support Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador, who received € 140 million assistance from the US in 2017, including drug surveillance, development and economic stimulus was punished.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and the targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American State and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, North America and Central American officials postponed a high-level consultation with a view to security and economic prosperity to organize a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a development in efforts to prevent resettlement to the United States.
But in the mid-September, the high officials explained that they wanted to continue the consultation and to end the debate on any of El Salvador's punishments.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence is now being calculated, who will speak in the middle of October in order to speak about the position of the government.
And three American ambassadors came secretly back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new bad news or punishment in Washington.
The White House, Mr Bolton's press representative, refused to comment on the details spoken by three American officials, including the two diplomats who agreed to discuss national discussions on an anonymity requirement.
Their discussions were confirmed by a close analyst to the government, who also spoke on the request for anonymity.
Study history
The next thing could happen is that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller publishes a report on the possible judgment of Trump, which has many evidence in the state archive.
Mueller is also allegedly examining whether the Trump campaign is related to the Russian attack on our elections.
If the Congress should change the party, Trump must account for this institution as if he would go back to the voters and perhaps even his peer judges.
There are many but, and I do not want to point out that the return of Trump or his European colleagues is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make a choice that affects the duration of the fight.
In 1938 German officials were prepared for a return to Hitler if only the West had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Münich.
We were miserable and missed the possibility of avoiding the subsequent multiannual slaughter.
History is going around the impeccable march of such turning points and democracy, or it is delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Director of the Prosecutor, a man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in boiling water since it was announced that last year he proposed the secret recording of the president and speculated the incompetentness of that position.
Rosenstein says The Times' statement is inaccurate.
“How can we react if the investigation of Brett Kavanaugh by the newly requested FBI is not complete or fair - or if it is confirmed by the State Court despite reliable allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, do we vote for the Congress in the middle elections if Trump should be responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy goes on a long winter vacation.
But I think we won't fail because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jew in Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over and used our ambassador home.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me a sabbat candle light on a table with a hooker.
With such a legacy, how should I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans is a Rapid Vienna Battle optimistic
The Rangers organise Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Australia, followed by the impressive fiction that was received in the beginning of this month against Villarreal in Spain, will put them in a strong position to become the European League of G.
Knee injury did not allow the middle player Graham Dorrans to show up the first time of the season before 2 : 2 viigi ended the game against Villarreal, but believes that Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for better results.
“This was a good point for us, because Villarreal has a strong opponent," said the 31-year-old player.
“We went to the game, believing that we could achieve something and left the game at a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but in general it was a fair result.
They were better in the first half of the game and we were back in the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but since the people support us, I'm sure we can get together and get a good result.
Last year was difficult, because of this, I was injured, and there was changes inside the club, but now we all have a good conscience.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can move on now, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Women cannot sleep because of the fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family.
Approximately half of the Nationalwide researchers said that they would talk to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said he'd talked about it with his children.
“The people want family members to take care of them, but they do not talk about this matter," explained Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationalwide life insurance activity.
But that should start.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless they know your wishes in advance.
Work with your counsellor and family, discuss where and how to get care, as these choices may be of paramount importance in terms of costs.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan to pay for these expenses.
Your funding opportunities for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance policy, hybrid life insurance policy with financial value to help cover these costs, or financial self-assessment - as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles already on the east.
You need to have a healthcare mandate to identify a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your request when you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the trustee with regard to your funding.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapable of doing so.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about medicines and allergy?
Write down these things so you'll be ready if you need to.
“This is not only the financial side but it is also important who would be doctors?", explained Martin.
“What medicines are needed?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Put it all in place."

earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami, which hit Palu in Indonesia on Friday, reported by officials, adding that the number of deaths is still increasing.
Since the connection has been broken, the saviors have not received any information from the Donggala regimen in the north, which remains closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated after the disaster.

Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for charges of domestic violence.
The oldest son of Track Palin, former Governor of Alaska and Vice-President Sarah Palin has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Tropers, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, in respect of suspicion of domestic violence, intervention and resistance to the report on domestic violence.
According to the police report, when a female person tried to inform the police about the alleged crimes, Palin took his phone.
The Palin is kept at the Mat-Su Pre-Investigation Institute and is held against an unprotected bail of $500, reported by KTU.
She appeared on Saturday at a court where she declared that she was “no guilty at all,” announced the news network.

He has also been accused of class B misconduct, punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking Father Todd Palin.
Regarding the alleged attack, the police called his mother Sarah Palin.
The case is now discussed in the Alaska veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of attacks at home, interference in the home violence crime report and possession of a weapon, all of this in drunken state.

The veteran groups criticised Sarah Palin in 2016 when she associated with the violent behaviour of her son with PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake followed the tsunami: hundreds of victims
At least 384 people have died since the earthquake in the Sulawes island of Indonesia on Friday.
A 7.5-grade earthquake fired a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.

In NYC, federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death penalty for Sayfullo-Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, which has killed eight people, and this rare sentence for federal crime has not been executed since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used Home Depot's rental car to attack the bicycle roads on the West Side roads on the Lower Manhattan road in October, both pedestrians and bicycles.
According to the request for a death penalty in the Southern region of New York, the prosecutors must demonstrate to justify the death penalty that Saipov killed eight victims deliberately and also caused serious physical injuries.
In both cases, on the basis of legal documents, there is a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury filed a 22-point accusation to Saipov, including eight murder charges with extortion, generally used by federal prosecutors for organised criminal offences, and the charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack was expected to “intelligent planning and planning, ” the prosecutors said, describeing the activities of Saipov as“ tremendous, cruel, and dishonest. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and damage to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’s family and friends,” says the intention.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the last death proceedings in the Southern District District Court of New York.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers, but as a result he was sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in 1953 in a federal case in New York City, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, when a married couple was executed after a conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an indigenous usbekk, reported in court records, showed a lack of regret in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators he was happy about what he did.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack on ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also wanted to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
For a 22-point charge, he hasn't taken the blame.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, said that they were “definitely disappointed ” in the procedural decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty extends the trauma of all those involved, instead of life sentences, without the possibility of being released, to the death penalty," said Patton.
Previously, Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Mr Tory said that NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised during the protest at the Tory Conference today to “mobilise the public army”.
The former Head of UKIP said that politicians had to feel the "hotness" of the Eurosceptics because one of Theresa May's own parliamentary members recommended to lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone said on Mars in Birmingham that UK “was already outside” if Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
However, Mrs May is facing the problem in conciliating its deeply fragmented lines, which were emphasised by the Conservatives in favour of staying, joining its protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is in trouble with keeping the path of his Chequers plan in the midst of Brexit's supporters, the remains and the EU's attacks.
The allies demanded that it continue to deal with Brussels despite the counter-attack and that Eurosceptics and Liberals were forced to choose between their package and the chaos.
Mr Bone said at the meeting of Mr Leave Means Leave in Solihul, he wanted to give up his plan.
He recommended to take Farage as a partner and to give him responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
'In his responsibility, we'd be out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough added: “I stand outside of Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers' plan.”
In reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to create our own laws in our own land."
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that the public opinion has changed since 2016: “The idea that British people have changed their minds and want to remain is not true.”
Andrea Jenkyns, the supporter of Tory Brexit, was also on the march and told the reporters: “I only speak one: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“Chequers’ plan is not popular among the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists who actually walk across the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave Chequers' plan and start listening."
With a message to May, he added: “Peace Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said that the politicians at the gathering should be “hiddenly” when they plan to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now the question of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We're not gonna let that happen."
He added to the enthusiastic audience: “I want you to put our political class on the edge of Brexit’s betrayal.
“We mobilise the nation's public army that gave us a victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, municipal, proud UK.”
At the same time, the remnants marched through Birmingham before the two-hour gathering at the center of the city.
A handful of activists flew the "Theories against Brexit" slogans after the group was formed this weekend.
The Liberals Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives about the security issues that were involved in their party's application at the opening of the conference.
“These are people who say that they can place IT systems and take all technology to Canada and more, for smooth cross-border cross-border trade in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a whole tail.
Something like good Brext doesn't exist," he added.

Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after the team bill gave him a victory over Sebastian Vetti
From this moment it became clear that Valteri Bottás qualified on Saturday in front of Lewis Hamilton that Mercedes' team's sequence plays a big role in racing.
Battas started a good start and left Hamilton almost forgotten when he defended his position the first two times and invited Vetti to attack his teammate.
The water was first on the bus stops and left Hamilton's group behind in close traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the box stop circle later and came out after Vetti, but Hamilton went to lead after being side by side, when Ferrari’s leader deficiently left free to pass the inner side after the third curb tried to protect it with a double movement.
Max Verstappen started a competition from the back of the square and was at the end of the first round on his 21-year-old birthday in the seventh place.
He then led the race for most of the time, driving the rubbers to the finish and passing by Kimi Räikkonen, taking the fourth place.
He finally went to the box stop on the 44th round, but he couldn't increase speed in the last eight rounds, which gave Raikkonen the fourth place.
It's a tough day, because Valteri has been doing a good job all week, and he was a real gentleman by me.
“ The crew has done a great job to have one of the two, ” said Hamilton.
It was a very bad language.
President Donald Trump smuggled at Senator Diane Feinstein's meeting on Saturday because he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused the nominee of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the Western Virginia Summit, the President did not directly address the testimony given by Ford in front of the Senate's Legal Commission, but instead commented on what is happening at the moment in the Senate, which shows that people are “bodies, disgusting and lying. ”
“ The only thing that can happen and which is happening at the moment that has occurred in the senate for a few days is that you see anger and angry, wicked, disgusting and lying people, ” he said.
“ When you look at press releases and leaks that are said: ‘ Oh, I did not.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question, ‘ Did you leak a document? ’ — “Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added with the look of the senator.
In July, Ford sent a letter to Feinstein about the charges against Kavanaugh and leaked at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his workplace.
The Hill reported: “I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leak his story,” said the Feinstein Committee.
“He asked me to keep my confidentiality, and according to his request, I did it.”
But his denial was not suitable for the president who commented on the Saturday meeting: “You know what, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but it's one of the worst body languages I've ever seen."
By continuing to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court who has been accused of sexual abuse of three women, the President insisted that the Democrats use these charges for their own purposes.
“They have decided to withdraw the power without selecting the resources.
You see this evil and disgusting thing, and they don't care who they hurt, who they need to take over to have power and leadership," he forwarded what the President of the Media said.

A pilot dies to save hundreds of people from the earthquake
A flight leader in Indonesia was declared hero after he gave his life to ensure that hundreds of planes transported safely explode.

The region is struggling with strong backwards, and many people are trapped under the ruins of the town of Palu.
Despite the fact that the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled the fluctuating tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, he refused to leave.
He remained on the job post to ensure that Batik Air's flight No 6321 was safely on the same route.
Then he jumped out of the tower, thinking it was falling apart.
She died later in the hospital.

At the same time, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths can increase to thousands. According to the National Destroying Agency, access was restricted to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the Agency, said: “The number of deaths may increase, because the bodies of many victims are still ruined and have not been saved.”
The 6-metre waves destroyed the town of Palu, where massacre takes place on Sunday.
Military and travel aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News: “The ambulance brings every minute new victims.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “Indonesia Red Cross rushes to help the survivors, but we can't tell what they can find there.
It is already a tragedy, but the situation may get worse."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at the Call on Sunday and said to the state army: “I ask you to work night and day to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready for this?" said CNN.

Micronesia air accident: Air Niugin airline claims that one man has disappeared since the lagoon crash.
Although it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crews were safely evacuated from a sinking plane, the air carrier now claims that aeroplane crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is lost.
Air Niugini said in her statement that since Saturday afternoon, they couldn't find one male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find him.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to passenger details, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed on Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy said that the plane landed far from the lagoon airline.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was crossing the plane.
Bill Jaynes, a American passenger, said that the plane was landing very low.
“ This is very good, ” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to tie on a drowning plane at a belt height to an emergency exit.
He mentioned that the cabin staff had panic and screaming and that he had a little head trauma.
The U.S. Navy and sailors, who worked on a nearby cavalry, also helped to save people by using full - blowing boats to get people to the shore before the plane fell about 30 meters underwater.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in the last two decades in aviation accidents involving air carriers registered to PNG, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
The analyst prepares a schedule for the evening when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the Attorney General closed the case against a man who was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the US Department of Justice, spent several hours as an expert observer in analysing intelligence data.
He brought to the jury how he used cell phone extracts to revisit the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to the previous claims of the young man.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford came to the courtroom on Saturday and admitted that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said that he had been in Sanford’s car, Sanford said that Tellis “speaked because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another problem was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers before the girl died for about two weeks.
The phone extractions showed that the females had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett argued that a while after Chambers' death, in Tellis, the Chambers messages, calls and contacts were erased from his phone.
“ He erased a girl from her life, ” said Hale.
Defense plans to make his trial on Sunday.
The judge said that he thinks that the case will go in the later half of the same day to discuss the jurors.
The High Breed: What is aware of hiphop?
Hiphop trio wants to fight negative genre definition by adding positive messages to music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hiphop has gone away from the foundations of its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the hiphop roots and make a conscious hiphop popular again.
Bands like The Fugees and Common have re-established popularity in Britain recently thanks to bands like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
New York's babysitter sues a racist message for a few courts.
New York’s nanny appeals to the court for discriminating dismissal after a couple of accidents in the family, where the mother complained that the babysitter is “a black one. ”
Couples deny that they're racists compared to extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed his disgrace when he learned that their new laser service provider Giselle Maurice was black when he came to work for the first day of 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband, saying: “EIIIIIIIIIIII, MANY MUSTANAHALINE.”
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, the uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman fired after his profound understanding of Miss Maurice, claiming that their social babysitter, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and had waited for a Filipino in his place.
Miss Maurice was paid one day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice appeals to a couple courts to get compensation for the dismissal, which he wants to receive on a daily basis in the amount of 350 dollars for the next six months, and the same work he was initially hired, but without a contract.
"I want to show them to look, so they do," he said to The Post, adding: "I know that this is discrimination."
A couple have rejected the claim that they are racists, saying that the closure of employment with Maurice was reasonable because they were afraid that after the insulting of a young lady they could no longer trust him.
“ My wife sent her something she didn’t think about.
He's not a racist.
“We are not racists, ” said her wife’s wife, Joel Plasco’s newspaper The Post.
“ But would you allow your children to hold on to the person you have been rude to, even if it was inadvertent?
Your newborn?
Come on."
In commenting on the comparison with blackmail, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from the baby’s birth and was “in a very difficult situation. ”
“ Would you mind going against someone like that?
That's not very nice right now," added an investment banker.
Although the case continues to apply, the public opinion has quickly condemned a few in social media, where they are severely judged as a result of their behaviour and thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington were afraid that the readers would not be in contact with the speaking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born right after the book was adopted, said in the letter: “It is difficult to put itself in the shoes of a person who read it for the first time before publication.
It's very fun now to know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He said that his father, having inspired him to write a children’s book about a small game bear, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic after rejecting his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was a puppet shadow because of the death of his father last year.
On Paddington, which he described as a “a very important member of our family” he added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
“ He was a rather quiet man, and he was not a splendid man, ” he said.
“But since Paddington was so real for him, it was as if your child would achieve something: you are proud of them, even though it is not directly your achievement.
I believe he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always acknowledged Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On his way down, his daughter was rushed to the hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors worked for nothing to save his life.
“ They regularly called to say that the daughter’s condition was very bad and that they do not believe that she would survive, ” said Mrs Ednan-Laperous.
“ Then I received a call from Nadia, who said that my daughter would die within two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
See you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medication that the doctors gave him to keep his heart open and quietly disappeared and left his body.
He was dead a while before that, and now all the systems began to stop working.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what would happen.
I couldn't cry, scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who now mourned her daughter, went on a plane with other passengers who didn't know anything about her experiences.
“No one knew that, ” he said.
“ I kept my head down, and the tears flowed all that time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outbreak of compassion for Nadia on this flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Postcards of a grieving woman prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their beloved suicide are working together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have tagged cards on the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davise's son Tyler was 13 when she suffered depression, and 18 years old when she killed herself.
“ I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day, ” he said.
The 45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“ Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile would make the whole room shine."
Yet, before his death, he stopped working because he was “in a very bad place with his own. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs Davis said, "I worry all the time that it has a domino effect."
Ms Davis created these maps “to let people know that there are people to approach and to whom to talk, even to a friend.
Don't shut up, you have to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who's been a friend of Miss Davis for years, lost Mark, a partner of his 15 years, not long after his mother died.
“ He didn’t say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything, ” he said.
“ We noticed a change in his behaviour a few days before Christmas.
He was at the bottom of his first Christmas – when the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact or nothing with them."
Ms Humphreys said that the man’s death was a terrible trauma for them, but they have to cope with it: “It will rip the wound into the entire family.
It's gonna rip us apart.
But we have to keep going and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on his hair while the FBI starts an investigation.
“I believed that if we could actually get something that he wanted – a limited time and a limited range of research – we could perhaps achieve unity,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Committee would "stop" in the midst of a permanent congestion of the partisans.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his republic supporters want the FBI to investigate it?
Their oppression was due to time.
The interim elections will be in just five weeks, on November 6, and if the Republicans do not go well as expected, they will be deteriorately weakened in their intentions to get the man wanted to take the supreme court of the world.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call the senators, making lobby work to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happens after the FBI's report?
The vote will take place in the Senate with 51 republics and 49 Democrats at the moment.
At the moment, it is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice-President Mike Pence to give a decisive vote and to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea's military runners “decaying” under Kim's government
South Korea's legislation has said that the number of North Korea's troops to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting the data of the Ministry of Convergence in South Korea, said that their number has declined in comparison to the 2011 military runners (2706) last year (1127).
Mr. Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China, and a greater number of traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
South Korea's citizenship has been offered to a large number of North Army Walkers.
According to Seoul, there are more than 30 000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean war in 1953 to cross the border illegally.
Most of them escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarised area between the two Koreans.
China takes military runners as illegal immigrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back to their homeland with power.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still in war, have improved considerably over the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the destruction of ceased nuclear weapons.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of the United States, in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for lack of progress in sanctions.
“Untrusted the United States of America, our country lacks security, and in any way, in such circumstances, we do not agree to make ourselves unilaterally first disarmed,” said Mr Ri in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that the man was inappropriate to judge the Supreme Court.
The opposition leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, appointed Judge General Brett Kavanaugh as “hysterical” and said that a man is temperamentally incapable of working as a judge at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi delivered an opinion on a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I without doubt noted that, if a woman had been in this way, she would have been called hysteria,” said Pelosi on her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denyed the charges that he had attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both teenagers were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening speech, described by his family and high school years, he occasionally almost screamed and sometimes left out of word.
He also explicitly condemned the members of the Democratic Party in the Committee by referring to the allegations against him about the loss of the Presidential elections of Hillary Clinton in 2016 as “grotess and co-ordinated fame murder” of the angry liberals.
Pelosi says he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that a man isn't fit to judge the Supreme Court because it showed that he's against demons.
“ I think he disqualifies himself with their statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats, ” he said.
Pelosi remained modest when he was asked whether he would try to withdraw him from office if Kavanaugh was confirmed if the Democrats were to have a majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
“I say so much – if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, he will not only be a judge of the Supreme Court, but he will not fit in the court where he is currently working," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now the judge of the Columbia District Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about the decisions against Kavanaugh's possible Affordable Care Act (health law — remark of translator) or Roe v Wade (representation of abortion – translator) because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
At his confirmation session Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would cancel some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not a time when a hysterical person could become a judge and expect us to say that it is not nice,” said Pelosi.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair word, a month-and-years-long profound anger, and he can't get away with it without crying.
“ We cry when we get angry, ” said Ms Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
He continued: “I got help from a woman who was headed somewhere; she said that she also wept when she was angry, but she developed a method that was that when she got angry and wept, she said to the person she was talking about, “You might think I was crying because I am sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tenders are partly accepted as a output of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is one of my early jobs in the office with a majority of men, where I once found myself crying in an unpredictable grievous when one older woman — a rigorous leader I had always feared — grabbed me and dragged me to the staircase.
“ Never show them you cry, ” he told me.
“ They don’t know that you are furious.
They think you're sad, and that's what they're happy with."
Patricia Schroeder, then congressman of the Democratic Party in Colorado, had worked together with Gary Hart for the presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on a hunt called Monkey Business and the campaign ended, he thought deeply upset Schroeder thought that there was no reason why he shouldn't think about being president.
“ It was not a well - designed decision, ” she said, laughing at me 30 years later.
“It was seven candidates, and the last thing they needed was joining someone else.”
Someone said it's like "The Snow White and the seven thumb boys."
Since the campaign was about to end, he was too late to collect the money, and he promised he would not apply if he did not reach two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, gave him only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he meant.
When he held a call that he said he did not launch a formal campaign, the feelings of gratitude for the people who supported him were irritated against the system that made it difficult to raise money and turn to voters instead of the delegations, and hatred for sexism — he was so overcome that he had tears.
“ You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown, ” recalled Schroeder’s reaction to her.
“It could have been thought that Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking about what they're writing on my tombstone.
"He was crying?"
How the US-China Trade War can benefit Beijing
The opening gaps in the US-China trade war were deplorable, and although the battle is far from over, experts say that the intergovernmental gap could benefit Peking in the long term.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, made the first warning fire this year, introducing taxes on essential Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs relating to the value of USD 200 billion (150 billion pounds) by imposing, in essence, taxes on half of the goods arriving from China to the US.
Peking has always responded to the same answer, lastly distributing between five and ten percent tariffs of 60 billion dollars on American goods.
China has promised the United States a shot to respond, and the second largest economy in the world will probably not be blinked as soon as possible.
Retreating to Washington would mean surrendering to demands, but publicly worshiping the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that when Beijing’s cards are correct, trade wars with the USA can support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that cause the loss of control over the economy in another country is in fact much more dangerous than the advisors have previously recognised,” said researcher Abigail Grace, who focuses on Asia's research at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready to return refugees
According to Syria, the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for the rebuilding of the country after more than seven years of war.
In speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and safer in the country's territory thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to restore the destroyed areas of terrorists to bring back normality.
There are now all conditions that refugees who have left the country on a voluntary basis could return to the country because of terrorism and their everyday life and living as a result of unilateral economic measures.
The United Nations forecasts that 5.5 million Syrians have escaped since the beginning of the war that started in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to receive assistance for the rebuilding of the devastated country.
At the same time, he stressed that the State would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe took the Ryder Cup race in Paris
The European team won Ryder's Cup competitions in 2018, undermining 16,5 vs 10,5 in France at Le Golf National golf course, near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on the European surface and has not won the Ryder bell in Europe since 1993.
Europe again received the crown when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team received 14,5 points needed to win the United States.
During the whole tournament, the US star Phil Mickelson swept a wing in the par-3 in 16 waters, giving the victory to Francesco Molinar.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all its circles, becoming one of the four players who have started the tournament in the current format of 1979 with a result of 5 : 0 : 0 .
With a result of 5&4 of the American Jordan Spieth, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen, at the lowest level of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, was 2 and 1 in England, Ian Poulter, who might have been the last of this Ryder's cartoon competition.
Eight of Ryder's cologne veteran, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the greatest European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
“ I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the cup back.
It's a team spirit, and I'm glad I was able to help," said the emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
He's going to pass the torch on to Jon Rahm, a fellow countryman who won a single game on Sunday in the United States golf club, Tiger Woods 2&1.
“I feel exceptionally proud that I won Tiger Woods – I grew up looking at him," said the 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four fights in France and now he has a career in Ryder's cartoon competition result 13 : 21 : 3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players in the world who's won 14 major competition titles, leaving only Jack Nicklaus behind.
The U.S. team was on the whole weekend's fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf during the whole tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the United States said after disappointing the team: “I am proud of the guys, they were hot.
There were moments in the morning when we pressured the Europeans.
We fought them.
The hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did a very good job.
Let's get together, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and go on.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to raise your hat.
We were better played."
