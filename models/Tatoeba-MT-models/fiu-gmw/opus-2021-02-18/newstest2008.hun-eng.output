European inflation slipped on food
The accelerated inflation in the euro zone is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The price increase in November was more than expected in the 13 euro zone countries, with an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent after 2.6 per cent in October – reported by the Union’s Luxembourg statistical office.
The official forecast was only probable of 3 percent - reported by Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian Banks, did not cut the basic ceiling, saying that the reduction would lead to inflation spiral, along with rising raw materials prices and reduced unemployment.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate close to two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in its twenty-two traps, "we need to talk" inflation, so that he does not have to act on this subject later.
In Germany, the figure of 3.3 per cent of the November inflation is 12 years of record; in Spain it has risen to 4.1 from 3.6.
The eurozone inflation has been high by the sprung food and energy prices.
The deadline quotas for wheat increased by 88 percent, and the soybean price has reached the highest value since 1973.
Food and dairy products also had to be paid significantly more in 2007.
The world market price of petroleum increased by 52 percent this year, and last month it cost almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation is jumping from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
The 12-month inflation levels remain at around 3% for the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, it is expected that ECB has decreased its interest twice in 2008.
You see a government crisis in the Gallup
After the long stagnation of Fidesz, Fides' support has increased significantly by the beginning of December, so since 2002, he has now had the largest camp, while Gallup had not previously measured such low socialist support of 13%.
For the Commissioner's party voters, because of the greater determination of opposition voters, the difference would mean more than two-thirds (71%) support against the support of the MSR of one-five (20%).
According to the survey, MDF and SZDZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the Commissioner's voters, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The economic public mood is further deteriorated to the previous depth - it has never been that high, 41 percent of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very bad, while, according to the other 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
The changes in their own financial situation are now more pessimisticly judged after more hopeful prospects in spring and summer.
For the following year, the majority of the population will take account of further deterioration and only ten years of improvement.
In December, more than any previous survey of Gallup, 71 percent of the people asked thought that the Prime Minister would rather be wrong than doing his job well.
In Ferenc Ferenc, 13 percent of the people asked trust or trust very much, while at Orbán Viktor, 38 percent of the supporters.
54 percent of the head of government do not trust him at all, 27 percent of the President of Fides.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is the fact that society thinks that it is possible to deal with dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister without a change of government.
While 35 percent of the government and the head of government were welcomed after the disturbances in October last year, this ratio is only 20 percent at the moment, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees only the solution in the new elections.
The interest in referendum is that 60 percent of the people who have been asked answering the question of a willingness to participate will be sure to go, and another 20 percent says that they would probably go.
As a comparison, only 55 percent of the elections to be held on Sunday would be sure and another 15 percent would consider its participation probable. The result of the referendum would not be questioned on the basis of the current intentions.
The school fees for the people 74, the visit fee 79, and 84 percent of the hospital daily fee would say no.
If we only look at the same proportions among those who are promising their participation in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89% of voters would lose the introduction of school fees, visa fees and hospital daily allowances.
The most expensive in Auchan, almost a fifth lifted by Tesco
In the Budaörs trade triangle, hypermarkets maintained a price increase of 16 per cent average last year, with the difference that this year the VAT did not rise.
Article of the solar economy
During this year, there was an average increase of 16 percent in the traditional Christmas basket of the Day in the Budaörs trade triangle, but in all hypermarkets there was an increase in value of over 1,000 forints.
Since in December last, the prices in the food shops were "departed", a percentage of the previous high base was no longer present.
However, it is evidently scary for consumers that what they could have received last year, under nine thousand forints, they are not even able to do that for ten thousand.
The Napa basket of hypermarkets has crossed the 10 thousand forints psychological boundaries with the least of 91 forints.
The highest basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the basket cost 6800 forints.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost at the level last year, but the turkey filly, the nuts and the maize, has grown very much.
The KSH's data were followed by the price of flour and bread in the stores, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
Competitiveness did not print the price of the product below 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this business that the price of the two-litre convertible bottles Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so that, together with the deposit fee, only 257 forints were requested for the product.
This year, however, Auchan appeared to the most expensive in the Napale basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculation, Cora 15, last year's Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18-18 percent the prices in Napa's basket.
Compared to the most expensive basket of last year and the cheapest of the year, the difference was 12 per cent, whereas between the cheapest last year and the most expensive year, 21 per cent growth.
In Forint, on average, the increase was 1480.
Last year, the average price increase came to 1206 forints, so that last Christmas he felt the effect of price increases in VAT.
This process has dispersed trade, and it is obvious that the stores could not decide how much price they use for a product, because they were unable to calculate the impact of price change on consumption.
(If the trader is wrongly planning the speed of rotation of a product, the price adapted to the traffic intensity may have serious advantages.)
Due to VAT last year, the price increase in Napa's basket was so extreme that the price difference was more than 1720 forints in 2006, while only 844 forints were the cheapest.
This year, this extreme was not present, since the most expensive HUF 1630 today was more than last year, and the cheapest was 1284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, and in less than 20 months, daily consumption goods were more than 30 per cent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily justify the data of the CSH: the statistical office has reached a price increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months for some basic foods.
So, for example, besides the flour at the egg.)
According to the Day basket, this seems almost impossible in the latter, since the price level of the product already quite expensive last year has produced a price increase of less than 10 per cent in the worst case.
Fruit suppliers appear to be in a stronger position than eggs, drastic price increases have been beaten by multis.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypers don't complain, they keep reporting a good year.
Our experience shows that in the three stores we have visited, the number of customers is no longer interested in prices.
They buy a lot of everything, they take long-term foods in platelets.
Wednesday morning, all three shops developed serious rows before the money prices because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that traffic is more expensive in the countryside, that there are multiple complaints to research firms that even its plans are missing revenues, not only for food, but also for long-term consumer goods.
In many places they save on disinfectants
More than a thousand infections have been reported this year in hospitals, mainly due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of the hospitals, the tension of the beds, the overload of the staff do not favour the stopping of infections, says the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places they save on disinfectants.
A recent MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the traumatological class of the János Hospital.
After a severe accident, a male showed the antibiotic resistance bacteria.
The patient was separated.
Similar infections occurred at the beginning of the same year.
The victim of a severe car accident was released from the hospital, but soon afterwards he had to return to MRSA and had not been able to perform a major surgery since then because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said the Head of the National Epidemiological Centre, Böröcz Karolina.
This means that so many infections caused by multiple-resistant pathogens must have been registered in hospitals, and the rest is not known.
Approximately two-thirds (683 infections) of infections are caused by the MRSA, i.e. the methicillin-oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria are carried by one third of people without causing disease in their nose.
The infections caused by the SA (e.g. throat inflammation, almonditis, skin infections, wound infections) are well responding to antibiotics and can be well cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop highly resistant bacteria to antibiotics, which spread rapidly under inadequate hospital conditions.
In the first place, in patients with a weak body, elderly or low body weight, the immune system may cause severe hospital infections such as wounds or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the doctor at the János Hospital, there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, such infections belong to the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection shouldn't be mixed with the ride, the MRSA is not there, said Tibor Nyulisi, where the presence of the pathogen is not investigated.
Resistance to antibiotics
"These patients are separated, the nursing staff carry the patient in rubber gloves and masks and have the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulisi.
Patients entering the hospital will be investigated to see whether MRSA is present in their body, but it is not always possible to avoid infection.
Non-fashioned sampling
Most of the hospital infections caused by MRSA would be prevented, but the current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not favourable to the prevention of the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, argued by Böröcz Karolina.
Once this infection is typically occurring in hospitals, in elderly homes, hospitals should be monitored and patients receiving MRSA should be isolated immediately.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not in fashion.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Cash doesn't finance these studies.
Most cases are thus exposed when the patient is exposed to MRSA, said the head of the CDC.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are domestic directives to cure certain infections and diseases.
The aim should be to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological studies should be carried out in order to avoid the development of resistance to medicinal products, but hospitals do not always maintain this.
Microbiological samples are even rarer in the adhesive or basic supply, reported by Böröcz Karolina.
Spray on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that the MRSA is most frequently spread from one patient to the other by means of healthcare personnel.
Therefore, the use of the mask, gloves, and the use of the mask, plays a very important role, but there are significant shortcomings in hospitals.
The MRSA spreads with drop infection, contact, but it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient under domestic hospital conditions.
In fact, the hospitals are often overloaded, often the beds are very close, while patients from a epidemiological point of view should be at least 1.5 metres away from each other.
Unfortunately, it is also observed that Böröcz Karolina noted that in unfavourable financial hospitals they save disinfectants, few nurses, many patients, so there are even greater chances of infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz where appropriate precautions are taken, less such infections may be detected or the spread of the pathogen may be stopped.
Management programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA causes huge costs to health insurance companies, so they fight it everywhere.
In England, e.g. the government programme included the prevention or reduction of MRSA.
It appears that the programme is successful, based on the data reported, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) priorities include the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
He wasn't drunk with the police chief causing a fatal accident.
The official expert opinion on the death incident caused by the District Police Commissioner XXII has been drawn up.
It can be excluded that the 21st District Police Commissioner, who was retired of his post, who hit a pedestrian on Tuesdays, informed Morvai Attila, the spokesman of the General Attila of the Capital Attorney General, on Friday after the expert opinion on this.
The expert opinion supported the primary test result, which has already established that the former police chief did not consume alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
The former head of the XXII district was hit by a 55-year-old man in Kossuth Lajos Street in the district XXII with his own passenger car on Tuesday, who didn't want to cross the side of the road to the designated patrol.
(The latter, therefore, that the pedestrian did not pass through the Zebra, is otherwise not a lessening condition, but must also be given priority to the carriage of cars.)
The pedestrian lost his life after being transported to the hospital.
Because of what happened, he resigned his post and asked for his retire, according to the police report, because he was so shocked by the incident.
The case is being investigated by the Boedapest PD.
Morvai Attila also argued that the former police officer cooperated with the investigating prosecutors from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Three credit framework agreements were signed with János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday in Budapest, with a total of EUR 400 million.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million in 2006 for the financing of the Hungarian budget of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund, from which a 100-million loan agreement has already been concluded by the parties, the current signed agreement concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
Education-related projects also serve to finance the budget of the EUR 150 million loan agreement.
The EIB approved EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later by extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, a EUR 50 million contract has been signed by the parties, which is primarily used by the budget for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
The metro four was also mentioned at the meeting.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, it would return to the need for and how to amend the original contract.
According to John Veres, this may take place in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has funded 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion since 1990.
The amount of the loans shall be provided by the EIB with an amount of 8 years of volatility to EURIBOR and without a preservation fee.
Bulgaria the EU Real Estate Paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - whole Europe is focused on a small Balkan country mentioned earlier.
What, where and who are buying the EU's cheapest but fast-tracking market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most populated property purchase destination in eastern Europe now is undoubtedly Bulgaria with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the hills are the most popular areas of Banszko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the beach Albena, the Golden Coast, the Napospart, the ancient Sozopol and Nessebár, but more and more people are looking for property in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balcsik.
According to the Analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country will sooner or later raise the interest of investors - so Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more people will also be buying in the area of Russia that is quite cheap.
The capital, Sofia, also has attractive opportunities, commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, so alongside the summer and winter season, the other two seasons should be a priority.
Therefore, prospective investors are already buying large amounts, such as in the area of Banshee.
According to analysts, people buy real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present and there are traditional Russian customers in the Black Sea and ski paradites.
Foreign customers are classified into three groups – says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The residents or renovated real estates are purchased at a price of between €50 and €100,000, or old houses rested for €5-15 thousand, and then renovated.
They require good access and communication opportunities, and they are interested in the closeness of a large city, business and generally the local doctor.
The second category was listed as the first 10 German holiday destinations (Bulgaria in December).
The third group is made up of business investors who are buying in the hope of medium to long-term value gains.
The cost of the capital property is constantly increasing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union, the lowest real estate prices are in Bulgaria, the last five years have increased by 21 per cent.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially above the increase in wages.
Fodor and six Hungarian percentages
According to Mr Fodor Gábor's Minister for the Environment and Waters, the expert meetings will be concluded on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the Ministers will continue the negotiations of the International Climate Regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are discussing the Bali Roaderv, which provides for efforts following the emission reduction period established by the Kyoto Protocol by 2012.
At present, there is an intense debate on this between developing and developed countries.
The United States also indicated that they do not intend to negotiate accurate figures at the moment, although they are steered to reach an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another major question of the conference is whether developed countries will undertake to reduce emissions, but also to provide financial and technological assistance to the countries in need.
There is also an agreement on aid to developing countries.
The fund, which is provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by the 16 members of the Management Board, expected to be within the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF) - in the Market and Profile.
Six percent of Hungary
Mr Fodor Gábor supports, on behalf of Hungary, the EU's efforts to maintain the role of flagship in global climate protection efforts and to promote the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 2020, irrespective of the success of the 'post-2012 Convention' and is ready to take up up to 30 percent reductions in the case of other major developed regions in the world and developing countries willing to accept their responsibilities and abilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that in 1997 the total number of countries joining the Kyoto Protocol targeted a reduction of 5.2 per cent, including the EU - then the 15 other Member States - was minus 8 per cent.
The commitment in Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the period 1985-87, which will be fulfilled by our country. - The press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
High bet Bali, as the long-term international climate agreement should be put under the roof within two years, or otherwise its entry into force would certainly be pushed after 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately follow a new international emission reduction system, which would be necessary in its latest report by the IPCC, the UN's International Institute for Climate Change, on the Nobel Peace Prize, on the basis of climate change.
This would result in a delay in reducing emissions and become inevitable to increase the average temperature of the earth above 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
YouTube is recruiting the British Army.
Records of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan are published on the video-share by the British Army Units, with which they promote themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) received you to YouTube: the special forces in Afghanistan have spent videos on their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, reported by the BBC.
These miniature cameras with helmets are checked at the command of the air force in the harbour, and then sent to London, where the domestics upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
From the Air Force soldiers, 139 recordings have already been recorded in this form on the Internet, and their "channel" has been viewed by over 75 000.
The British Ministry of Defenceheadquarters registered in spring 2007 and publishes videos of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of National Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraqi international peacekeepers (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Mission in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally wanted to set up the videos for recruitment, and according to the Ministry of Defence, it is also good for the public to know the real purpose of the military's foreign presence.
The propaganda published in such a form is almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment promotions - he said to the BBC, the defence expert Gordon Mackenzie, but he also has inevitably received some political messages, as he demonstrates the right of military action decided by the government in a specific form.
The Americans made a game.
The army is also concerned that, along with carefully edited, censured videos, amateur videos are also transferred to the distributor, which, for example, show the death of soldiers: in a slightly hypocritical, "official" propaganda film, the officers speak maximum of losses, but do not show the bloody side of the fight.
By the way, from the Iraqi and Afghanistan military space, a number of videos have been released on the Internet that were made on sharp missions, but the British army has only recently received it.
The Americans are recruiting a little differently, the free-loaded Americana's Army shooter game, where the player can come straight into the hands of the soldiers in a more or less life-long simulation.
There's torching and poaching Christmas at the ministries
The Minister of Labour of Lamperth Monika does not seem emotional: instead of a Christmas party, he will hold a year-blocking meeting for his colleagues who have been owed by poach and coffee since 2007.
There's a ministries that have a live music party, where they're going to make Christmas moods in the hearts of officials with a tompo and a barbecue.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - so fun is power.
The state offices are ready for Christmas.
The biggest secretary Christmas party is held this year in the defence wall, but HM isn't waiting for the ministries.
The children of the fallen soldiers will be given a gift at the Christmas of the Ores, and the families of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions will be hosted, but they will also arrange a press reception.
The wallet is 25 million for the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are fired from the gum compared to the other wallets.
The GKM party is held in the Future House, with a total of 420 000 forints and about 300 guests from six hundred ministries.
At the wallet's celebration, they'll stick to the Christmas mood, but they'll be performing and devastating.
The NFU’s Christmas cost 4 700 000 forints and was organized on Wednesday - concerts and dinners in the National Justice Council (OIT) building.
The room rent cost a million forints, spent over 400 invitations for the remaining part.
We understand that one of the departments of the NFU is official for another Christmas celebration: this is arranged by a bidding company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development, from EU money.
The building of the Village Theatre was rented for the purpose.
The information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt since we failed to reach the competent.
You don't need a suit
The building of the OIT saw not only the NFU as a guest, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held Luca Day Ball instead of Christmas on 7 December.
They didn't ask for money to use the OIT rooms.
Five hundred people participated in the ball.
The party started with the minister's greetings and could be danced live after dinner.
The [origo] question was that the prom was not mandatory at all for the evening dress or suit.
Puritan party is arranged in the health, work and municipal wallet.
The Ministry of Health organises a show and celebration in its own building for 400 000 forints for workers.
However, the Minister of Labour of Lamperth Monika is officially waiting for his colleagues at the end of the year's work conference.
They're counting on eight hundred guests who -- the press department told them -- they're going to get coffee and poach, so they're gonna bring the party out of 350 000 forints.
On the other hand, Minister of Municipality Gordon of Bajnai will simply coke with his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry of Government and Rural Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas meeting in its own large room, waiting for 436 employees.
There are 2500 forints per guest for the Christmas party - the amount is a buffet bet and a buffet.
Ever since János Veres is a minister, the same is for the workers of the PM every year.
However, there will be no party mood, not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon date will strengthen the formality.
The farming wallet will give a new year's bet on January 20th, the Ministry Christmas is missing.
The bet is held in Vajdahunyadvár, the City League, and according to the wallet's announcement, they're offering 1,000 forints per 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple reception, which is only officially accredited foreign diplomas for Hungary.
These annual bets will begin with a short ministerial greeting and will be completed with a back-tracking.
There is no Christmas party at all at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs - they told [origo] in the competent press departments.
They couldn't tell the price of the environmental wallet's office Christmas at the press department.
After all, over 400 people were invited to the party organized in the Museum of Industrial Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are growing
On Friday, their Board of Streik Coordination on Mondays will be formed by the League Trade Organisations and the National Association of Working Councils.
They will hold a big protesting meeting on Saturday, and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act, will begin with the suspension of work.
The action will certainly lead to a significant crisis in transport, as rail transport will almost stop almost completely and will be striking by the BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Organisations presented details of the Monday strike organised together with the National Association of Labour Councils.
There will also be the LIGA - MOSZ Streik Committee, which will coordinate the activities of Monday.
They hold a big protest meeting on Saturday, and from Monday onwards, the organisations joining the strike will stop the work for an indefinite time if they cannot reach agreement with the government.
This means that it has not been marked - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act - the date of completion of the strikes that have started.
If the National Assembly did not accept the Health Insurance Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
However, if they vote for the legislation, the strike committees will come together and decide on the continuation.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will only be voted in late evenings or night hours.
As a result of the strikes starting on Monday, there can be significant incidents in transport: the railway will be stopped for an undetermined period, a part of the public transport in Budapest could stop, more than half of the Volan companies.
At the same time, there will be a halfway roadblock on many points in the country.
A number of trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the strike call and their list is constantly updated in the Liga's moondays.
Some organizations have reported strike for an indefinite period, while others have declared a temporary suspension of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, MÁV and the Free Trade Organisation of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on a sufficient service, but with Christmas holidays, more and more people travel on the rail.
According to the so-called communications, the BKV has been striking for 13 hours, between 7 and 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, with a four-hour strike from the LIGA Electricity and Heat Industry Organizations, and called for a 2 and 2 to 8 hours of work to be suspended by the Pedagogues' Association and the Democratic Trade Organisation of Pedagogues.
The Hungarian Medical Association takes a two-hour warning strike at nationally, changing dates, the Democratic Trade Organisation of Workers (EDDSZS) in the SZEF Health and Social Sector.
The four demands made by Liga are that the government withdraws the proposal for the reform of health insurance and forgive a new concept for social debate.
The second requirement is to gradually introduce the new pension calculation method due from next year.
The third is to ensure that early retirement has already been able to enter into the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the operation is that the Free Trade Organisation of Railway Workers (VDSZ) belonging to the League Trade Organisations does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport on the railway wing lines, and expects other offers.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has raised the country's risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard established in August of this year, with the support of Better Hungary, raised the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Policy Capital Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division).
In the company's "risk warning" it was said that in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "in the short term even violent ethnic collisions can occur with the intensification of ethnic tensions between the Hungarian gypsy and the non-cigny population".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's policy strategy is supposed to be aimed at provocating such an act, added the research institute.
As it was written, this can be led to one of the major failures of Hungarian political actors: "The public debate on Roma has been released by public actors to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could have built a political strategy on the opposite of the gypsy-Hungarian."
This deepens the problem, inevitably normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the Hungarian Garde's activities, under the influence of the major domestic and international media attention, "has significantly undermined the image of Hungary abroad, particularly as regards the belief in stability and democratic development of the country".
It is recalled that since the fall of 2006, the reorganizer of radical and extremist groups in Hungary has become a part of the reorganisation of more than one organization called "national self-defense" since summer 2007 in Hungary.
"The common nature of these confusions is that they define themselves as a civil organisation while openly proclaiming their members - whether armed - for defence (defense, defence, law enforcement), and referring to the incompetentness of the police, the army, the state."
It has been noted that all this is done in accordance with the method that seeks to place various political ambitions based on the political and impartiality of society in civil society.
The emphasis on civil society and the form of association therefore serves not only to avoid legal failures in the registration of courts in the case of these associations, but also to a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard's activity is also a risk-raising factor for neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, in several neighbouring countries, they also refer to Magyar Garde as a potential threat, while ultranationalist politicians in some neighbouring countries wish to demonstrate their own anti-Hungarian policies by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the creation of the Magyar Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Europe, so the political risks for the whole region have increased.
As stated, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Roma disruptions that occurred in one quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has made use of this by using the foundation of the Guard, saying that the organization's aim is "national self-defense".
For the past 17 years, they believe that there has been a 'citizent terrorism' in Bulgaria, but the state has remained unsatisfactory and indifferent - reminds us of the political capital.
They added that the initiative triggered a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it was written, there is an increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts that certain Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that resistance would create their own gang.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard has shown similarities to the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat by organising their own defenses - read in the risk warning of political capital.
Juhász Attila, Director of Political Capital Research, said that the risk analysis was one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they will issue their risk analysis annually, and if they experience something that may affect the change in risk, they will inform the public as well as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Not everywhere is a red-lettered holiday
In Hungary, the law clearly indicates the red-letter days, and around the holidays, the reorganisation of working days has become a general practice, which will be fewer next year.
There is no single holiday in the EU and in America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and holidays.
Work break days are mostly linked to church holidays, significant historical events.
We are celebrating the new year: the last and the new first day of the year, the last one, is just so that we can rest on the grassroots.
We have a total of 11 red celebrations all year long.
National holiday is March 15th and October 23th, the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, we celebrate the foundation of the state, on May 1, and on November 1 and 2 we remember our families and friends.
In addition, we have a two-day holiday for Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our national, national or even religious holidays are rarely falling by the calendar for the weekend, working day shifting has become a practice in cases where we would only work one day before or after the red celebration.
True, the price of extended weekends is that we do not stay away from work school on the previous Saturdays.
The fact that the day immediately prior to or after the holiday should be worked exactly, has been laid down by the Minister of Labour for years in a separate regulation.
The legislation covers all employers and their employees, both the public employees and the public service relationships.
However, without interruption, it does not affect service firms and institutions operating on holidays, as well as their purpose.
This year only end-of-year holidays are changed: from December 24th, life is almost stopping in the country, as the experience has shown that Christmas and Silvester days are "sleep" by the majority of people or used their saved freedom for this purpose.
Next year, we will have more holidays to the middle of the week or to the end, so there will be less workday relocation than this year.
First, the calendar will be converted around the holiday of the work, so that workers can stay at home for four days.
The Saturday of 26 April will be a work day in exchange for Friday 2 May.
The second transfer is linked to the 23 October holiday: on 18 October, we will have to work on Saturday instead of the 24th of Friday.
The end of the year, however, could take place in the event of a celebration next year, since, from 24 December, almost everywhere is a nonstop break even if it falls on Wednesday.
Six terrifying little things to piss off your colleagues
E-mails we forget to send, voice mail messages that we will never receive, innocent lies that we almost no longer notice: they "colored" every day at work.
The question is whether you get used to small discomforts or take the gloves and avoid misunderstanding, revengeable situations for others.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were looking for me about the marketing class," says one of your colleagues.
That's why you missed a meeting?
In the best case, you regret and try to make it right, maybe call the marketing department to tell you that you forgot to pass your message (that's the less usual solution).
Most of the time, with an apology, it's done.
Before an awkward apology is made, it is worth reflecting on what is to get unpleasant moments for your colleagues and willingly seek to avoid this.
Are you gonna borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritating than reaching out for a file, office or phone, and it's not anywhere.
Remember you put your firefighter on the table yesterday, but by morning, he's been on foot?
Maybe you'll find out your missing pen on the desk of one of your colleagues?
Without request, don't take anything from your colleagues, because they will be rightly angry at you to rid their property.
Don't put in a pocket of office envelopes, mail-it, 'cause it'll be unpleasant if you're out of time, and you'll need it right away.
Are you talking about the privacy of colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the rumors that are already spreading.
Who, who, what did you do?
Where and why?
Do not tie your information on your colleagues' privacy to everyone's nose.
If one of them shares the most intimate secrets with you, don't get back on his trust.
Be buried in yourself, and in his absence, do not discuss it with your colleagues, even if others know about your colleague’s affairs.
Are you inadmissible?
When you call in the office, you are a patient referring to snatching headaches because you have a bad feeling or feel you would rather rest that day; think of your work, your uninterrupted tasks, your scheduled work, you have to do something different for you.
Don't spot me with your colleagues.
If you know that you're not going to the office the next day, or there's something you need to stay at home to tell your colleagues and your boss not to face you the next day.
Showing, whining, calling
Did you get involved in the work, but is it hard to pull out the cheerleaders?
Did you become an involuntary ear witness to a phone call that would have been better than to hear?
Do not disturb your colleagues by smiling, singing, having a loud conversation (speaking above their heads), swinging your feet, continually blaspheming, loud dissatisfaction.
These can all be disturbing, even if they are not inclined to a project (writing, planning, organisation).
Are you blaming others for their mistakes?
If there's no time, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, no other reason for your memory.
Don't refer to any possible chaos in the office, your cheerful colleagues.
Admit it if you made a mistake, and it's the disadvantage of someone else, and get out of the barn.
Ask him how you can make your mistake right, replace the failure.
Are you feeling too comfortable at the office?
Snacks and slippers: comfortable dressing for home, but not in the office!
Don't wear comfortable leisure clothes if you allow your job.
Don't be shlampy, your colleagues, and respect yourself by going into the office in a ordinary dress - if your workplace requires it, in a pretty, elegant way!
If you want to answer, you're not interesting anymore.
Raspberry with the car in the usual morning stopper.
There's a special song from the radio, a violin voice that is associated with electronic effects.
I'll make the sound up.
Music has changed the tempo, and the bass arrives next to the previous sound colors, and then as a real jewelry, the female chorus is connected.
It's Zagar Wings of Love on mr2.
The domestic musical life has made us very much obsessed with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it looks like it's different when you're listening to the new Zagar record.
The presence of Yonderboi, a few new and exciting productions coming up from the home digital underground, slowly change the overall picture, and in vain fashion again the guitar guitar rock, the domestic electropop, proves that there is new under the sun.
He started with Bázs Balázs Pécs, and he played in Yonderboi's orchestra until, perhaps, because two twins didn't get away in a barn, he went on his own way.
With its project (Zagar) and its music, which combines the jazz, the electronic dancing music, the pop elements, but it began to break through when the film soundtracks were requested to compensate (e.g.
(Turkish Ferenc sedan).
The formations played in smaller clubs were known by a broader audience when the first album of the Wan2 magazine in 2002 was listed as the 50 main domestic album, and he called Zagar, in Yonderboi's company, almost the only domestic trenders that seemed marketable in the West.
No doubt, Zagar and the music box became "trendi", but of course no one asked them if they were willing to wear the label.
The band reacted as it should: he made a new, better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, which is now published, can open new ways for them, although the title itself intends to create continuity in the early Pentecost years.
That's because Zúszer Balázs was one of the lines of an old band there.
We would be in place with airline, flying references, but alongside the airlines of music, it has now appeared - according to the spirit of the age, trend - the louder guitar, the rock and roll effect.
In these songs, György Ligeti, a singer who is currently working with the Puzzle band in England, showed himself at the Millennium Premier.
The album also produced a real radio recorder, the newly played popular music from the morning to the evening, mr2 Petőfi started to smuggle into the ears with the six domestic singers 'underground Divas'.
So everything is fine (?).
Hvg.hu Zússer Balázs asked.
Hvg.hu: With this new scar, how many layers do you play?
Zúszer Balázs: The definition of layer music, does not mean much to me.
I think there are two types of easy music castles; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commerce and honest.
Alternative, underground music can also be flat, nonsense, and can also be prepared to sell only, which makes them a communist.
But it can also be a good pop for sincere inspiration.
In this spirit, the host's attitude also works independently of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see the difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences for your music?
Zs.B.: In the foreign country, especially west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There's not only the age-to-year-olds that go to concerts, but also the older ones.
They monitor the light musical changes around them much more, as it is also considered to be part of a contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
The music here is born for some reason, not for purpose.
The audience's role is more perceived in concerts where the impact is already working on each other, but this only lies in the untangible changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed that if you want to answer to the audience, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works solo, and he built his career west of us.
Zs.B.: We're not really on his way, no matter how sometimes they try to explain it to our music.
We're more of a team player who trust in the other musical presence and let it go out.
At first, it was, of course, inevitable that our works were compared with Yonderboi’s musics, as more of us were created from his band and left another way.
hvg.hu: On the top of Mr. Petőfi, the Wings of Love is the first place.
Many of them first heard the name Zagar.
Are you aware of the more popular style of opening up towards a wider layer?
Sz.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a scarf, and then we'll sell the record.
This song is more than that.
We were supposed to be the finale of the album, which we were trying to solve the hangorgy and the harder topics on the record until then.
Hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly them - what was the principle?
Zs.B.: The idea was to be a gospel-like choir.
That's when the idea came to build this choir from our own musical musical musicians with sound voices.
This was the case with the six-member choirs - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Peterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], German Juci, and then we were baptized by Underground Divas.
Hvg.hu: Did the song be designed or shaped by the girls?
Zs.B.: The number has been in the instrumental version of a long time, and then when the record was compiled, we thought that this number needed something else.
I was attracted to singing.
That night, I was singing the song that the girls later learned.
It was almost first and terrifyingly spontaneous.
I remember that he was very evolving back then, but of course, I needed the Divas.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked that hard.
Hvg.hu: All the girls on the record and at the concert seemed to be in the background.
There is no solo (except Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they sing completely together and they're not louder than music, so music is not just accompanying their singing.
They were on the back of the stage.
Is that deliberate?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were behind was just because of technical problems.
But it's conscious that we didn't want to share solo strings.
The number is also about forgetting our ego a little from where it came from, where it goes, just let those certain wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric condition we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: What was most of the work?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the musical composers actually had harder pieces than mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play at a competition piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work the grood for a long time, and then slowly everything was in place like a puzzle game.
Hvg.hu: What's your favorite number about the new album?
Zs.B.: It's always changing with the concert and by "I've let down" the disk.
Now the Prophet Is A Fol, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
The traitor broker risked billions of dollars because of a feeling of minority
Unfamiliar.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French Sociétée Générale bankerias, Jerome Kerviel.
Because Kerviel lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that it was not a talentless Kerviel, rather than just a big player who wanted to follow his colleagues.
Contrary to other banks, he recognised the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
"Reduced mental capacity," he said to the police officers.
However, as the French Le Monde reported, Kerviel's statement shows that it has earned a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from its business at the end of the last year.
It's not only in America, it's a coincidence.
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In summer, the American crisis managed to search half a billion euros.
He already felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there have been news that there will be problems with the so-called subprime mortgages for low-income customers or clients with repayment problems in the past.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe in it and made me a good horse.
The annual profits reached EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I searched for the first half billion, I didn't know how to report," he admits Kerviel and adds that he didn't hold anything for you.
In his testimony, he admits that he faked his reports in such a way that it can't be discovered.
He's got his bosses tricked, even when the Eurex stock exchange started to be interested in his transactions.
The risk was profitable
Was she afraid we'd find out?
I'd rather not.
"I thought it was just the fact that I was looking for 1.6 billion for the bank to calm them."
Where did you have the will to risk so much?
He's gradually gaining his position.
He worked at the Société Générale Bank since 2000 after the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already brokerist, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with $90,000 per year.
Yet he knew he would never be looking for as much as others.
"In 2005, during my first conversation, I knew you were looking at me with the wrong eyes.
My end, my professional and personal development, too," Kerviel told the detectives.
Not long after he entered, the first great success came.
Allianz's shares have been searching for a half a billion euros for the fall of these shares during the London bombings.
And it started a lavina -- he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses are supposed to know everything, or they're more likely.
"By the time I earned money, they were blind."
Except there was a hit at the beginning of the year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
He wanted to do a shower in the middle of January this weekend.
When he started working on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank announced a few days later that she lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
He became suspicious about his freedom.
"I've only taken four days in the last year.
The broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn't want anyone to look into his reports," Kerviel finished.
Chances of obtaining 365 billion in Czech Republic
The Czech Government’s ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, from which the Czech Republic can receive EUR 14 billion (approximately EUR 365 billion) in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount available from Brussels from 2007 to 2013.
Some 125 billion of the seven operational programmes are costing regions.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain a sum of about 100 billion kroons from the Business and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion crowns, is for transport.
The transport programme represents the largest operating programme and 22 percent of the funds available for the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base of transport infrastructure, which will take place by 90.8 billion kroons next year.
The Business and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and firms to win their assets for innovation companies.
Companies should also obtain resources for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is the least successful in winning funds from the EU funds in the new countries.
Ex-Chairman Nicaragua's 20-year prison has been approved by the court
On Thursday, the Nicaragua Appeal Court approved a 20-year prison sentence to Arnold Alemán, the former president of the country, for the financial fraud of 100 million dollars (approximately 1.8 billion kroons) in 2003.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in domestic custody near the capital.
The fact that the former leader of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 is going back to the bars, according to the AP news agency, is not yet clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Perez, it will depend on the head of the prison whether Aleman's punishment will be discharged at home or going back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that government funds were regularly transferred to foreign companies in Panama.
These fictional companies and their account numbers were actually related and closest supporters.
These funds were subsequently executed by some of the foundations founded by Alemán to finance the election campaign in 2001.
Approved our budget
That's right.
They accepted the state budget.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government, adopted by a coalitional majority, without the support of the opposition.
This was passed this year with the support of social Democrats last year, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party were unable to accept the non-acceptation.
Unlike a loud debate on the lack of confidence in the government before the vote, no drama has happened this time.
The House of Constables has generally ignored this law, although the most enforceable.
That's a certain contradiction.
Each government begins and ends with a number of chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the powers of the government and the opposition.
This is more appreciated in the press, which is why you get much more attention in the media.
Discussions of politicians are much more interesting for the public than just numbers.
The state budgets of the Social Democratic Governments in the past have faced three deficiencies which the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of them is the high proportion of the statute of compulsory, so-called trustee expenditure, which represents not only pensions, but also social benefits approved last year by the quiet 'coalition' of ČSSD and KSČM before the elections
The second is the first failure as a consequence of defective management.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficits of the budgets for cities and flights.
However, the highest risk is not the deficit of the public budget.
This is publicly and relatively controlled.
Timed bombs are the deficiencies of the city and flight budget.
Many mayors would be able to make money for other investments than taxes, taxes and bank credits, often insignificantly issued bonds with which their city houses were disproportionately sold.
In recent years, these debts have been settled by the massive sale of shares in energy and other distribution networks received from the State from privatisations.
Now they don't have that source.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we conclude that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase like the rest of the world, with which the Czech Social Democratic Party continues to praise.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to regulate public funding.
Instead, however, the country was increasingly put into debts.
The other countries, with two exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, the Czech Republic, were much more rational than they were.
This is primarily a huge shame for previous governments.
We belong to countries that, in global terms, are the least threatened by poverty.
For this reason, there is no need for huge social programmes, which, unfortunately, have grown to a gigantic size in recent years, completely unnecessary.
Although this year, it has been possible to eliminate the part of the unreasonable populist expenditure approved before the elections this year, even if it will not take place in the near future to set the border on retirement and pension reform, any policy in this country will actually end, and whoever governs it will be, it will only be officeing.
A little overexacerbation indicates that the majority of the money taxed by the governor politicians generally become pensions and social benefits are their mechanical distributors.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the limitation of normal expenditure by the authorising officers.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments had not disbursed everything that could have been done in the past decade.
If we do not really want to be in the process of becoming purely governor politicians, we need to be patient and wish for rest in the preparation of the further reform laws, this not too strong, well-known coalition government, that the state can only issue as much as it can obtain from taxes and taxes.
Only these will allow a balanced budget to be achieved progressively.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada's central banks have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
The money markets are thus cost more than $100 billion through stock exchanges.
On these stock exchanges, they raise the interest rate on the bank for which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the American Fed gives 40 billion dollars to the stock exchange and makes further twenty-four available to the European and Swiss Central Bank.
After the 11th September attacks, it is now the first time that the central banks of each country agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the greatest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow," wrote Bernard Baumohl, a consultative company in the Economic Outlook Group in his report.
"The coordinated action of the central banks in the United States reduced the likelihood of a recession from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost 60 billion dollars in the United States for unpaid loans.
Estimators are still counting on billions of losses.
"Central banks can really be afraid of what might happen if they have decided to take such a procedure," said Kieran Davies, the general economist of ABN Amro.
Looks like it's really bad," he added it to her.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will give more money to their customers.
This would reduce the need and the US economy with possible consequences for global economic growth.
The central banks decided that the so-called LIBOR, the interbank offer interest rate used on the interbanking market was not reduced.
This meant that the banks were constantly afraid of reciprocal money lending, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain also reduced their interest rates a few times during the autumn.
"This will have similar effect on the further reduction of interest," said Greg Salvaggio to the Reuters News Agency from the Tempus Consulting company.
Some analysts do not believe that the steps of the central banks contribute to the resolution of the crisis as it does not solve the basic problem, the fall in the US real estate market.
Klaus: The Incredibly Discussions of Economists
Global climate change threatens most developing countries.
President Václav Klaus reiterated his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticised the international conference of the United Nations on climate change in Bali.
The book Blue presented in Vienna, not the green planet, made it impossible for ecoologists to argue.
Klaus believes that not only the conference structure is unacceptable, which is a special mix of representatives of governments and civil society organisations, but also the fundamental difference between rhetoric and reality accompanying it.
"The debate there is absolutely indispensable for the structure, it is only a vocabulary, which is a substitute for the resolution of the current problems," said Klaus.
In the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that his subject is very important and therefore he is so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction in addition to the fact that the book was published in German translations, since, as he said, "I often only meet the caricatures of my opinion."
So now interested people can read their opinions that are not distorted.
Klaus reminded me that, although not a climatologist, he believes that he has sufficient foundations to write such a book.
Since he was experienced as a academic and economist capable of monitoring and reviewing professional activities.
To conclude the book, it was noted as a thesis that the climate is constantly changing, that its changes are normal, and not all scientists have the same opinion on the warming of the planet that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious, so they do not pose a threat, and the efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and inadmissible.
In addition, as a person experienced in totalitarianism, it considers that it is unacceptable to use unproved opinions on others, which it considers dangerous freedom limitation.
He repeatedly explained to the questions of the present, 'not against a reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant envirentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits'.
Klaus has already spoken about a similar topic in Vienna two snowdays ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand of them couldn't change their licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and couldn't change their old license at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can still apply for the exchange, so that the offices will be able to issue a new licence in due time until the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the new year, 100.000 drivers would leave their journey without valid entitlement.
According to the offices, the licence was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the flights represent a heavi fall in interest in the exchange of licences, the main city offices have been exhausted by applications for licence exchanges, for which interest has increased this week.
The Central Citizens' Office receives around 2 000 customers a day.
It's about half an hour in line.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers did not change the licence.
It takes 20 days to issue a new licence.
However, a new licence may also be required with a reduced period of five days.
However, in such a case, the driver must pay an additional 500 kroons.
The drivers who cannot make the compulsory licence exchange by the end of the year and are leaving with an invalid license are threatened by a penalty from January.
The guilty one must pay up to a maximum of 20,000 crowns.
However, a police officer may also arrange the quarantine by means of an agreement.
In the event of a public administration deprivation, the penalty is 2 500 crowns.
On the basis of previous information from the City Hall, the person who is not traveling anywhere will also receive a fine.
They say you can pay up to 300,000 crowns.
The Ministry earlier called on the offices to be despairing and to impose fines of up to a thousand crowns.
According to Karel Hanzelka, the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, however, there are no tens of thousands of fines that threaten anyone.
He thinks the license is a document where people can decide whether or not.
This is not an ID which must be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive, they should cancel the license.
It's enough to take you or recommend sending it to the appropriate office.
By the end of the year, licences issued from 1964 to 1993 no longer valid.
However, drivers must gradually replace other types of driving licences.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 may be replaced for three more years.
The validity of licences issued from 2001 to 2004 will only expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the punishment for Berdycchel cooperative detectives.
Joseph Opava and Petr Koňařík were ex-policy officers who were suspected of conspiring David Berdych's cooperatives, and were sentenced to threeteen and ten years of prison.
As a result, the Supreme Court in Prague determined a final effect, which thus reduced one of them for one and the other for two years.
Detectives of the Prague Organisation Crime Division were originally threatened by a 14- and 12-year-old prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today’s decision, but only the Supreme Court may request a review.
Although Berdyche is also suspected in this case, he is waiting for the first sentence.
In other procedures, he has already been punished for more than 16 years.
You can't get any more.
In January, the County Court found 19 mostly guilty of the participation in robbery attacks, of which 16 appeals were dealt with today by the Supreme Court.
Most of the defendants rejected the charges from the start of the investigation by the fact that it was a speculation case.
According to the Senate of Central and Czech Republic, after the agreement with Berdycch, the police members also provided criminals with information from police sources, covered individual robbery attacks and helped the gang to avoid criminal prosecution.
The band therefore gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Koňaří.
The prosecution is about the crimes of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
This is mainly about robbery, which has often suffered serious health damage, but also abuses of civil servants' powers and non-authorised weapons.
Because the police found illegally holding guns, steel-seed bullets, laser control or machine gun.
The gang was accused of exploiting tens of millions of crowns with robbery.
Without a block of 20 members, the courts have already recognised Berdych's other robbery and many others as legally guilty in this case.
Other members of Berdych's environment before the court will testify in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first trial so far has avoided Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are in advance arrested in Ireland, waiting for a final decision on their release to the Czech Republic for criminal proceedings.
Account for child exchange: 12 million
For children exchanged in maternity, Igor Veleba demands 12 million kroons of pain plus court expenses from the hospital in Třebíč.
Three million for mothers each, two million for fathers and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200 grand as a parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostal Veleba, disagrees essentially.
"These claim is rejected because it's too much," said Dostal after today's trial.
"In order to deliver an opinion on the anti-competitive proposal, we need an expert opinion drawn up by the opponent.
We'll find out if there's any useable value.
But we maintain our view that this will be measured by hundreds of thousands for everyone," he emphasised Dostal.
He thinks that the sum should move between 10,000 and 200.000 Kč for four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for every month until she raised her own biological daughter.
Veleba served the expert judgement on the basis of the compensation negotiations, which was prepared by the University of Motol in Prague.
Children’s parents, according to psychologist and psychiatrist experts, suffered different degrees of mental damage and stress.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even if they met with such an eyelash that they didn't stop the newborn change.
Women struggle worse with the actuariality of the trauma and what is happening right now, Veleba summarised the content.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses on 9 December at the birth of Třebič.
Last week, the children returned to their birth parents - Nikola Čermas in Přibislavica, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloňov.
Vysočina’s travel manager, Miloš Vysstrčil, gave families at the end of October 100.000 crowns to replace their expenses, which were made by the fault of the hospital in Třebičské, which is controlled by the course.
All hospitals in Czech Republic have compulsory damage insurance under the law.
In the event of a mistake, they must enter the reserve fund, in exceptional cases they may request the founder's help.
The courts so far have granted relatively low compensation to the people, the amounts have been calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, exceptionally, a few million kroon tables.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Visesko
Bolek Polivika lost the case for the title of the Vášisko Kingdom.
According to the Ostravai court, he first used the Valachi King's name, but the project was developed by a team of Tomáš Harabish, who cooperated with the actor, with many years of work.
Politka has not participated in the trial today.
However, according to the legal representative, the case is probably not to end and the customer will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabiš and his team revitalising the popularity of Bolek Polivika," said Polivika's lawyer after the trial.
He thinks that the Valachi Kingdom is the actor-comic to everyone's mind.
This opinion is shared by Harabich.
"There's almost a ten-year-old job behind us.
Searching for money and imaginating actions," he said.
He thinks the reason for the debate is money.
"Years later, they found out that the project was successful and they could win something.
They want to reanimate from our work," he added.
Profit-making business
According to the court, the Valachi king first used Polivika's television program.
In 1993, Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned it.
However, at that time it was not linked to the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing Valachi passports.
The original student stunt action was formed into a business and profitable entrepreneurship which was then founded by Harabiš to create a society of the Vaisisko Kingdom.
In 1997, Polítka agreed to indicate its name and signature in the passports and even to visit its owners' farm and theatre performances.
Who takes the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabiš himself was using the idea, which Politivka made public to its company in Maneseses.
"Bolslav Politivka's popularity has certainly helped the Valachi Kingdom project," said the judge.
However, he added that the spirit of the project was Harabiš and his team involved in the intensive process.
The cooperation between the parties who have been confronted today continued until 2000 when the official coronation of Harabiš Politka was organised in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there have been controversial discussions between Polítka and Harabiš, which have stumbled into the rescue of the "Everlasting King I. Boleslav".
On the initiative of Harabich, Jarmila Šulaková has taken the leading role in the kingdom as queen of mother.
In 2002, Polítka Harabich and his associates filed a court appeal, which was rejected today by the court.
The battle planned by Harabiš could bring light in the debate for the throne and half the queen.
This fight should be a new king.
He didn't want to tell you the details and the time yet.
"We don't want to catch anything.
This should be something like a Slovacko Kingship.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr. Politka can apply freely," he added Harabiš.
207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot test: excellent judgments
Honestly, I never liked Peugeot 206.
The quality of change, driving and manufacturing are often below average.
But the successor already present on the market, the Peugeot 207 is significantly better.
And the combination called SW goes a little further, so there's nothing left for me to think more about.
When I tested the 207 classic Hatchback of Peugeot, for example, I complained at the back seat on the head.
This time, the complaint is now over, because the cartoon of the combi means that the two-metres high giants are no longer suffering in this regard.
Urgently in the world
I can get through the inner space soon so I don't repeat myself many times.
It's a relatively successful design where I have the only objection to the poor console.
There's something I'd appreciate more designer inventory if the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and where are the times when we complained about the short bottom of the seat or scratches.
Side management has also improved significantly against model 206.
As far as the space is concerned, there is an increase in the size of the carosserie.
After that in the combi, the head disappears from the few places that have been mentioned.
I'm in the trunk.
The main area of the package is therefore on this vehicle.
This is very well accessible (also thanks to the rollable rear window) and I have to assess a large space.
The empty spaces are equipped with tanks, which are ideal compromises.
They're not in the way, they can be scattered, and they can handle harder objects.
But let's stay with the volume.
On the basis of the tables, the base is 428 l, which is more of a average value compared to competition.
However, in the Czech Republic, not the most wanted car of this class - Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of boleslav in mlada, we find that Peugeot is far behind a lot of 52 litres.
In the case of a foreign holiday or a baby car, this value is almost critical.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I should even mention the almost straight floor after the back of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was driven by four cylinder-ignition engines with a voltage of 1,6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's how it should look like the 1,000-six hundred who drives the family hatchback.
It's quiet, it's low-consuming, and it's pulling.
If we compare Škoda's equipment, which often works as if they're ragged into his exhaust, so I can only enjoy it.
Price breaks
Car prices are not cheap.
However, we must remember that we have tested a car with a large internal space and a very good engine.
The car still leaves for 329 900 Kč with a four-mile alien engine.
The car starts with 410 990 Kč, which is enough.
The tested Premium equipment will throw the equipment with an additional 80 000 Kč.
But we even had head airbags, automatic climate, automatic window wipers, back windows, electric remote control...
Which means the car costs 531 900 Kč.
This is a lot, but counts Fabia's accessories and receives very similar results.
So there's nothing left but a decision on the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is unsuccessful
In British schools, more and more children in Eastern Europe are concerned about further development of local school affairs.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases when the discussions between immigrants and children of domestic residents became violence.
The problems related to the integration of children in eastern Europe are well illustrated by a case in the northern region where discussions between their seats and Slovak immigrants are intensified.
Disputes and bonds between students are already characterised by the relationships between parents.
The situation ran into the fact that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who said a ten-year-old student with iron.
The sinner defends him by insulting him with racist secrets.
The police had to go after the attack of two 12-year-old girls in Slovakia on immigrants.
The girls are supposed to be male with racist remarks and thrown with stones.
"When we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop this, he hit us with apples and pears, then exposed his naked back," he wrote the mother of the Slovak students' new unpleasant event to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the local residents considered the debates on East European immigrants to be a survival fight.
The above cases indicate that the mood between local and immigrants in British schools is becoming tense.
In Great Britain, 70 grand job searching for Slovaks are reported.
About 30,000 Slovak students go to British schools.
Cuba's most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is a island of freedom.
Whatever you're expecting from your vacation, this can be achieved if you're right.
The golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, are calm as a fisherman.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or marble cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean islands, you can find this in a full and richer list.
On a island, however, you can find much more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the bravest of their American exorcisms.
Columbus called the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havanna became a treasury store and a transhipment rod that was robbed by the Spanish in America and transported to Europe.
Then the American era was followed.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, was built because everything that was considered guilty in the United States (mostly the festival), was welcomed in Cuba, and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
For example, they were among their guests.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
There were tower houses in Havana, cars that became a symbol of culture in the 50 ’ s of the past century on wide strata.
Ernest Hemingway purchased property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojímar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio are decorated by the signatures of the stars and politicians of the American Showbusiness.
What about today?
The village of Bodeguita in Havana can also be provided by you.
They're mixing cocktails in the bar of the dear Nacional Hotel for you.
And the cars of the '50s cult are still driving in Havana, as the frogs and sons that once were exported have long been rotated in these salt and wet airs.
Although most of the oldest parts of Havanna are significantly rested, there are no such beautiful colonial monuments anywhere else in the area as there is.
Other places are becoming more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Given that tourism ensures the money that is so necessary, the development of it has a green path.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels were built in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of the Province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers a world-wide reaper, which is primarily appreciated by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, sugar cane was transported to the sugar plants by steam and motor trains.
Their motor park has not been renovated for decades, so the machines operating there are visible, whose contemporaries have been seen only in museums.
Where should we go?
Most of Cuba's visitors do not avoid the most familiar places.
So there's no need to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should remember that the Hemingway Library, mentioned above, has a museum and who loves the writer, shouldn't miss a visit to this museum.
The Viňales Valley is one of the most painted parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
Freak vegetation grows from the massage.
Forests, cabbages and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soils are gathered in their larvas, which also covers scattered circulars with a thick vegetation.
The valley is a place where the best quality of Cuban tobacco may be produced.
The final form can be met when visiting a cigar factory in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that Major Zeman's Chile episode was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the colonization of the Spanish islands.
The slave and sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy has spent a body in the beauty and monumentality of the city that is not too large.
In four centuries, the Spanish architecture of Columbia, which was significantly influenced by later French residents, had almost nothing changed.
The Trinidad between the plane of Escambray and the sea is such a misleading place that even in the 50s of the previous century, there were no roads that would have connected this region to the rest of the country.
That certain isolation helped to stay outside.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't break down. Everyone was happy that there was a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon in Trinida, it's worth looking at the interesting locations of the area, such as the Playa Ancón coast or the Sugar factories Valley.
And tonight, it's good to go to Casa de la Música, which, after darkness, will wake you up, where the music will only be quiet in the morning.
Baracoa
Some people consider the city located in the eastern part of Cuba to be the most beautiful city.
I'm sure this opinion is already influenced by the road itself.
Both roads from Guantanamo have to fight high and pertinent mountains, leading through the nature of human activity, which is barely affected by human activity.
Thanks to the unrelated nature of Cuba, UNESCO recorded its eastern country language on the World Heritage List.
This is where the best chocolate is made, the church has the Columbus cross (in reality it was 100 years after Columbus was sailed) and the hill where the former castle was standing and today the El Castillo Hotel is located, some of which are the most famous ones in El Yunque.
The coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Meastro plains, the Disznó Bay and Isla de Pinos island, the tropicana cabaret, the Cuban patronus of Caridad del Cobra, the Santeria, the African religion, which is professed by the offspring of former slaves, can be written.
I mean, as they say right, it's better to see it once.
Afghan allies are passive, claiming Americans
A few soldiers and the lack of equipment are also influenced by the process of the United States mission in Afghanistan.
Minister of Defence Robert Gates said that NATO should present specific plans for the coming years.
The Afghan mission is not taking place according to the ideas, agreed by the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, whose units are in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the increasing resistance of the Taliban movement, eight participating countries are also consulting on further plans and coordination of allies.
While the US Minister of Defence, Robert Gates, has been called for greater activity this week to the NATO troops, the United Kingdom considers the strengthening of the Afghan government and the strengthening of development aid as a priority.
"Development in Afghanistan can be tampered, but military forces can only be part of the solution.
The other thing is to enable the population to start further economic and security development by themselves," he told BBC Des Browne British Minister of Des Browne.
Ninety percent
According to the data of the US government, Afghan's uprising activity has been the strongest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 percent compared to last year and 60 percent in Helmand South.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, about one quarter in the southern regions.
According to the United States, the allies also reached their borders in the organisation and equipment of the teams.
They specifically asked for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We have to think very much about the specific objectives of the future and the methods to achieve them," Łekl Gates.
He spoke in a similar spirit today, Jaap de Hoop, the NATO Secretary-General.
"I'm not glad what's in Afghanistan on earth and in air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's not enough," he told the Reuters News Agency De Hoop at the end of a three-day discussion with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Out passive
There has been debates between the participating countries over the past few months about whether allies will deliver the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticised for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively large in Afghanistan.
However, they were placed in areas where the least of violence and combat requirements are thus not as high against them as we are against us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The Sun Brittle Post called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"The Afghan diarys have discovered: The Germans are playing while our sons are fighting," wrote Sun in a material supplemented with a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild was attacked and a photo was published by a British team in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt reaches the unit in 2009
Every Czech has 84,000 crowns of state debt.
The total debt reached 842,7 billion kroons by the end of September.
The government intends to take a loan of 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by EUR 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of the public budget.
The Czech Republic’s state debt reached 842,7 billion kroons at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion.
But from June, it fell by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed today its state debt data from the beginning of October.
There are more debts than 84.000 crowns in each Czech Republic.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion kroons.
"For now, due to the lower deficit of next year, we could only cross the single-milion crown limit in 2009.
The next year, debt will move around 900 billion and a billion crowns," he mentioned the Analyst of the iHNed.cz server Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the Next Finance analyst, Vladimír Pikora, sees this: "In 2009, we can pass a billion pass.
That exactly when, for now, the unknown depends on the next budget.
If it proves that the situation would change in policy areas, the politicians would be willing to save more, this could take place until 2010.
But I'm not expecting that change," he mentioned.
Increased debts
State debt is formed by central government debts, which is mainly formed by the accumulation of public budget deficits.
State debt is financed by cash tickets, public bonds, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
In this year, the state’s internal debt has increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion.
The foreign debt of the state has now increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion.
The so-called ‘saleable state debt’ reached 803,3 billion kroons by the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion from June.
The average maturity of the government debt increased by 6.5 years.
"Budget between the whole year has risen by 13% in the first quarter, which is indeed enough for the economic progress.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated in bonds with a 20% increase.
The bad thing is to increase debt, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be what to trade if there will be a pension reform," commented Pikora on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of public debt in 2007 show that the government planned to raise a loan of 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by EUR 152.8 billion due to the improved development of the public budget.
This amount is primarily the deficit of the public budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion kroons this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion kroons.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency is talking about the planned maximum amount of 13.3 billion kroons, the payment of pensions ten billion reserves, the financing of 43 billion kroons of public bonds and the repayment of loans worth 1.8 billion kroons from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher presents today before a carum court because of the name given to a pluss bear
On Thursday night, a carum court sentenced the British Teacher in Sudan to 15 days in prison and expelled the country because of the violation of Islam.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6-7-year-old students to call a plus bear Mohamed. However, Islamic religion forbids the illustration of his prophet.
Such an act can be punished by skulling.
The 54-year-old British woman, who was arrested on Sunday at the University High School, was accused of Islamic violations and repression, according to paragraph 125 of the Sudanian Penal Code, after several complaints were filed by her parents at the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September, when the teacher asked his 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's blonde bear.
"The children were proposing eight names, including Hassa, Abdullah and Mohamed," says the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, from 23 to 20 children chose the first name of Mohamed.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the prophet of Islam, but also a very common first name in Sudan.
The kids then made a diary with the picture of the bear and the label "My name is Mohamed".
The problem lies in the fact that the illustration of any prophet’s image is an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues in the same school said that she knows him well, and that the teacher would never have done anything that would harm any religious belief. She thought it was just a 'indebted mistake', "I'm only sorry that she voted the name with the children."
Many of the teachers agree with this opinion, and they believe that the teacher is "he treats children very well" and "he never talks about religion in the class".
Remember, Mohamed in Great Britain is the second most popular first name and there are 14 different writing methods in English.
This is one of the ways of showing respect for the prophet so often chosen by Muslim families. (Gyakran is the first child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of a first name?
Can you, for example, get that name in a game?
It's obviously a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement at the last Vienna trial in Wednesday on the future status of the region.
The outcome is a failure.
Without approaching these positions, the discussion between Serbian and Kosovo Albanians ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, on the sixth and last future status of the Separatist Province.
"It is unfortunate that the parties have not reached agreement on the status," said Wolfgang Ischinger, EU diplomat at a Vienna press conference.
The American Ambassador, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was at risk, and urged Belgrade and Pristinia to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
"No need for violence in the near future, but a very difficult period will come," he added, emphasising "the existence of obvious tensions".
The mediation ends on December 10
On Monday, the last visit to Serbia and Kosovo is a mediator troika involving the European Union, the United States of America and Russia.
In 90%, the future of the Albanese lactic region can be clarified after Ischeger, Wisner and the Russian mediator, Aleksandr Bocan-Harcsenko, submits its report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, announced its sixth and last meeting since the UN gave the Troika a new mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans consider their mediation mission to be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already vagued the matter of Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, are holding on to continue negotiations after the deadline has expired.
"Russia was committed and remains the negotiating solution in favour of the compromise," stated Bocan-Harcsenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of Kosovo under the leadership of the United Nations, the Western authorities believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina stated that she was willing to declare her independence unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide on her behalf.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"Sorry we failed to reach an agreement," announced the president of the independent state of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden, where "the negotiations of the last chance" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion, and the future Prime Minister of the Province also expressed his regret.
He added, however, that the idea of an autonomy in Belgrade would be "the continuation of the past of murders and deportations".
Domino Effect
The Serbian President, Boris Tadic, believed that the compromise was still possible, and the majority of Kosovo's Albanians were warned about the consequences of the unilateral call for independence.
Belgrad is still in an unstable area due to the independence wars of the nineties.
"For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of a compromise," said Tadic.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation once again said that the decision should only be the Security Council, where the Russian alliance has the vein right.
"The House of Kosovo will have the last word."
"For Serbia, only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable", stated the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"The negotiations took place for two years.
They must end the same place where they started, in the Security Council."
Fatmir Sejdiu said to journalists that "the last word will be the House of Kosovo." He added that the unilateral exclaim of independence from the Albanians is based on "conciliation" with the western powers.
Bush calls for an agreement between Israel and Palestina
On Tuesday, President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestina finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
Bush stated that the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmúd Abbas agreed that they would immediately take a negotiation between their peoples in order to settle the debate for 60 years.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush made a promise to support them in every possible way in order to sign the 'conciliation treaty' in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians have to eliminate the 'terrorist networks', and Israel has to leave the colonial activity - Bush announced and reminded the two parties of their commitments in relation to the 'Frieden Plan' adopted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that Abbas led the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel aimed at "the signing of a peace treaty that solves all the problems of the dependants, including the central issues".
The latter concern three delicate problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestine debate: the future borders of Palestinian, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who lived in the territory of the Israeli state today during the 1948 conflict.
Abbas, who was speaking after the American President, held in addition to the future negotiations "global and profound" and touching all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, Asylum, National Borders, Colonies, Water and Security".
After that, Olmert, entering the platform, promised that the future negotiations "will be open and continually", and he will strive for them to end in 2008.
By the end of 2008, Bush set out the achievement of the 'waterways of two states' between Palestinian and Israel.
Saudi Arabia stated that Bush had a promise to this before he decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (which was recorded as the success of Washington's Annapolis participation) initiated a plan with the support of all Arab countries, which guarantees peace to Israel if it is withdrawn from all the Arab areas in the 1967 war, including the Eastern Jerusalem.
Annapolis "responding the history of the Middle East, especially because he takes the problem with the root and focuses on the central issues," says the Saudi Prince in his interview with the Saudi Arab newspaper.
The D.A. says the police aren't responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As usual, being with such news, the official position and the rumour contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of the investigation initiated by the national police general inspection body (IGPN), a police car traveled on the Louise-Michel street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, a few minutes after 17 hours.
"The car was patroled, so he wasn't in action. He went 40-50 km/h without sirening," we learned from a police source.
The young without the two helmets was driven by a green, "not registered, so not to be used on the road" (see below) with a branded engine of Kawasaki.
"Because they didn't keep the right hand rule, the engine crashed on the left side of the police car," says a police officer.
The results of the alcohol test on the passengers of the vehicle were negative.
It shows the strength of the impact that the front of the car has been swept in, the windscreen is shredded in the shape of the star, and the bumper is broken down.
The State Attorney of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, stated in his extraordinary announcement yesterday morning that he was commissioned by the IGPN and Val-D'Oise County Public Security Directorate with the investigation "initiated in the absence of human murder and help from evil".
During this afternoon, the attorney said at a press conference that the police's responsibility can be ruled out at the current stage of the IGPN investigation.
According to the attorney's report, three witnesses interviewed on Sunday night confirmed "the police report that the scooter came relatively quickly from the left side of the police car".
On yesterday’s day, from a strip, which undoubtedly was pulled by the footsteps on the road, they showed that the two vehicles were stuck and went together for a while until the police car was able to stop.
Vehicles have been booked for technical examination.
The bodies of the two victims were investigated yesterday.
What happened immediately after that?
Yesterday, the rumour of Villiers-le-bel spread as a run-fire, saying that the police quickly left the scene without helping the two young people.
In this regard, IGPN is cautious, but it excludes the police from making such a serious mistake.
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which is a more thorough investigation and requires greater caution in this context," we learned from a police source.
Liberation met a witness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of his residence looks exactly at the scene.
"My cousin, a hospital nurse, we went straight away to try to revitalise them," says the eyewitness.
"We couldn't do anything."
Then he noticed "a cop who was completely confused and hurt.
The other two tried to revitalise one young man, and the fourth one called."
The tension among the present is increasing, as the hopeless situation of the two young people has become apparent, so the police are moving their colleagues from the scene by car.
We also know from the witness's report that the ambulance arrived about 20 minutes after the police left.
Heart massage was also applied, but in vain.
"I wouldn't say that the police didn't try to help young people.
Young people were given help.
The firemen arrived at the scene immediately.
They've done everything they can to save them," the D.A. emphasised.
Women's tension in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police prevented the first demonstrations of the need condition introduced two days earlier by General Musarraf.
According to the witnesses, about 20,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken in the state's eastern part of Lahore, were wounded from the tear gas bombs used by the law enforcement forces.
In response, they threw stones to the police, most of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
Similar events occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and wounded the lawyers.
They've produced more than one person.
In Islamabad, the Attorneys of the Supreme Court called for general strikes, and demonstrations were announced for arresting around 500 opposition members, human rights warriors and lawyers in the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Multan, located in the central part of the country, and Peshawar northwest, there were several demonstrations.
Since Monday, the lawyers' movements have been supported by the great Deathida Majlis-e-Amal alliance combining religious parties. His leader called the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the need and garbage to those who have sworn before Musarraf.
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure notified on Saturday night.
The Court must state in the coming days the lawfulness of the re-election of President Musarraf by indirect vote of 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from his office and was replaced by another.
"Andaz, which we witness, is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court," said the President to the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise that he would leave the military for the purpose of fulfilling the role of the civilian president after the emergence of the state of need, he announced on Monday, Deputy Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem.
Musarraf had to separate him from his military uniform until 15 November, i.e. until the end of his first presidential mandate.
The Deputy Minister for Information also confirmed the news of postponement of the January elections.
By the way, the Pakistani government contested the rumour throughout the country that Musarraf would have appointed a forced residence as President.
More than one third of pregnancy has not been planned
This result involves unwanted (24%) or inadequate or unplanned pregnancies.
Even today, more than one third (36%) of pregnancy has not been planned - from the French National Institute for Demographic (Ined) study, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act which liberalises contraception.
This result involves unwanted (24%) or inadequate or unplanned pregnancies.
Ined estimates that various methods of contraception such as tablets or bee spiral are still failing in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the Institute, liberalisation of contraception has made birth control more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women aged 20 to 44 took contraception pills in 1970, but now that ratio is 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
Each fifth of us is planning a few months of accuracy, and if possible, it will be spring, as this is the most favorable season to receive the child.
spectacular repair at the space station
Scott Parazynski's astronaut and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work in space for more than seven hours to implement the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel that is essential for the scientific activity of the station.
This dangerous spaceway proved to be a record in many respects: the repair lasted for a very long time, very little time to design it, and far from the housing modules, the astronauts had to do "smoking" tools.
The problem came on Tuesday when the astronauts separated the Harmony module from the Discovery. It is a giant cylinder-shaped element, which will soon be the location of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see the framed section).
This module is a way to get to the laboratory modules.
However, there is a need to look after their supply of electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to relocate one of the modules producing electricity, which was already on the ISS with the use of the 17.5 tonnes solar panels, to its final position.
The crew then began opening the module’s 76-metre broad solar panels.
At that time, one of the harmoniously contourable tables was injured by a cable stuck in about 1 metres of length.
In order to avoid further injury, the plate has not been opened.
Astronauts originally had to take a check-out walk from the Discovery Space Cycle and then fix another malfunctioned rotational panel. Instead, they had to spend their full time fixing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski's choice was to do the stunt by hanging on the 30-foot robot arm of the space shuttle to the crane of the station.
He's one of NASA's best space-deporter.
He has a high, strong, highly skilled, muscular upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old doctor had to "makeoperate" the damaged sunset.
After thoroughly assessing the damage caused, he cut off the defective cable and fixed the damaged area with a few "bridges".
He also helped another "spacer" who stayed near the safe doorway and the other astronauts, including the captain of the crew, Peggy Whitson, from inside.
The tool he used, a mini hockeybot that was used by the insulation of hundreds of volts of solar panels, was swept out by the astronauts of the station and "swept" together.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until his associates fully opened the board and then packed up his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts held a half-day rest, and then today the Week returned to the Discovery space chlorine to begin the return planned for Wednesday.
Reduction rate of EADS shares
The price of the EADS shares in the Paris Stock Exchange has fallen, after the company making aircraft and defence equipment announced that the prolongation of the development of A400M aircraft would result in an additional cost of EUR 1,2-1.4 billion.
The rate of EADS shares is currently at EUR 21.96 after a decrease of 4%.
The company had to review its forecasts for the 2007 operating result as the development of the A400M engine is delayed, which is evidently the delay in the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in the transfer of a combat aircraft, which was announced in October, will cost a sum of €1,2 billion to EUR 1.4 billion, more than 1 billion to Airbus', reported by the parent company of the European EADS manufacturing company.
As a result of these expenditure, the EADS has to report new plans on its operating results next Thursday, when reporting quarterly results - the company added, but no further figures.
The group also indicated that the six-month delay was taken into account in the preparation of its new cost estimates.
In 2006, the operating performance of the EADS decreased by 86%: this was largely due to the delay in the development of another programme, the A380 giant machine, which also caused a high financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to transfer A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Stay on status quo
There is no big surprise for the Sunday elections: a large majority of Russians will vote for the Head of State of Putin, the United Russia.
In this Russia's need for stability, to say arbitrary governance, will appear after a powerfully manipulated campaign.
Today, i.e. three days before the parliamentary elections, the Russian Head of State Vladimir Putin speaks to the constituents, which have already been recorded, but the content is still secret.
Putin leads the Kremlt support party, the United Russia candidate list, which is expected to win a grand victory at the elections.
When foreign ambassadors were adopted yesterday, the state-owned conduct said nothing: he only made a further burst against the interventions of the Western countries, which was the topic he liked during the campaign.
"We know what the price is for true democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections without any violation," he added.
However, according to the opposition, this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign in which they think they have pressured the electorate.
The leader of the Communist Party, Genmaij Zjuganov, says, "that dirty election in Russia was not even in Jelcin's time."
After last weekend's protests were defeated, the former chess champion Garri Kaszparov was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstrations, and his attorney claims that he would still not be able to visit.
"Russians are still thinking as "homo soziotics"
The predictable electoral results raise two more obvious questions:
Who's following Putin in the head of state?
The date of the first round of the presidential election was published in the Official Journal yesterday, which will be 2 March 2008, and the candidates may indicate their intention to leave until 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, its mandate will no longer be extended.
There's no other successor on the spot.
What role does Putin play since March?
You're going to be Prime Minister?
Or will the Almighty Party of Russia or the Head of the majority of Parliament decide on the government and the President?
Whatever happens, the power to leave wins at both parliamentary and presidential elections.
This is now a tradition.
"Russians are still thinking of a 'homo socio-ethics': they don't feel that they can control their fate," says Lev Gudkov, sociologist, director of the independent Levada Centre.
Nikolaj Koposov, the Historicalist of the University of Saint Petersburg, goes even further: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later than Europe, so there is a delay in the development of civil society, and the traditional community spirit has hindered the development of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the '90s, "She has returned to the paternalist model, which was perfectly suited to the people. More, since this new kind of paternalism was not intimidating, but involved with certain economic well-being," she says Maria Lipman, a worker of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "refuge the personal responsibility of their own," which quickly showed us after the breakdown of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all the layers of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of united Russia are led by 65 Governors, who are from the leaders of the 85 Russian region.
Freedom imported from the West is often embedded by chaos, as it was in the 1990s.
The public opinion favours stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extreme parties.
Tamara Cserednyenko, a 54-year-old teacher, says, "Why should we think?
The people in power aren't so bad, so why should we replace them?"
Depressing memories
After over 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive has become public, documenting the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime.
The 47 million archive papers, which contain 27 kilometres of sculptures in Bad Arolsen, Hessen, were so far only available for 'humanitarian' purposes, i.e. they gave only unique and name-specific insights to the victims or their descendants.
In May 2006, 11 states that handle the archive, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open the archive to researchers and historics.
After every state ratified the convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen archive enables historians to conduct research on "relocation of imprisoned persons, camps' residents and the health status of forced workers," explains Reto Mastern, director of the archives managed by the International Committee on the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, opposed the publicisation of documents, as they contain names and thus confidential information.
For example, the presumed homosexuality or mental disability of certain deported victims may be such.
The aim was to search for civilians deported or sentenced for forced work and to provide evidence of their internship, which would enable them to receive compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently dealing with the processing of tens of thousands of individual needs.
Some of the scientific community, however, does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive of great importance.
"These documents basically do not contain anything new" stated in 2006 Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre of the University of Berlin on Antisemitism.
The EU and India Free Trade Agreement would be signed in 2008
The annual turnover of bilateral trade in Indonesia is now at EUR 60 billion.
The EU's first trade partner in India is 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India are hoping to sign the Free Trade Convention in 2008 - Peter Mandelson announced European Trade Commissioner and Minister of Trade in Kamal Nath in India.
The EU's foreign ministers already approved in April last year to launch negotiations with India, South Korea and the South East Asian Association (ASEAN) for the signing of free trade agreements.
The EU's first trade partner in India is 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also the main foreign investor in India, but India is only the 9th largest trading partner in the EU, according to the European Commission's figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement could have economic recovery for both parties" and "India could thus increase its presence in a 450 million blooming market".
The 10 main products exported by India are the primary or secondary importer of Europe, added by the European Commissioner. Each year, the two giants, Europe and Asia exchanged "EUR 47 billion" and "EUR 10 billion" services, announced by Danièle Smadja, the Head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, and, at the same time, regretted the fact that the bilateral trade "has not always reached its full potential" in the EU and India, in the eightth diplomatic summit in New Delhi, which will be attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and José Manuel Durao Barroso, President of the European Commission.

Answer to concerns: Bank of England offers 10 billion pounds to the financial market for five weeks of maturity
The Bank of England wishes to alleviate the anxiety of credit conditionings, so on Thursday, it announced that it would pump 10 billion GBP on the financial market, which is made available by a 5.75% base ceiling and, unlike usual, five-week maturity.
"We want to improve the concerns that the money market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we would also like banks to plan their liquidity position more safely for this period. Therefore, from 6 December, a significant part of the bank's reserves will be offered in the framework of a five-week open market operation on the international money market" is in the bank's press release.
According to the bank, 10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 p.m. local time.
This is the first time that the Bank of England issues liquid funds for five weeks in the framework of an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In a press release from the Bank of England, it added that "is ready to take further measures" in order to adapt inter-bank loans to the basic interest rate of the banking bank.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate exceeded the level of 18 September: currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the start of the summer financial market crisis, the Bank of England has calculated a significant criminal interest on the amounts pumped on the financial market, which has brought banks back from taking them.
According to the rumours (which is only reinforced by the evolution of the price of the pound compared to the euro) many would have been more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which could have been achieved with more favourable interest and more discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and the Nouveau Centre group closed themselves from discussing the socialist articles of the proposed purchase power legislation, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
The text negotiated at the Socialist meeting included about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the Socialist Party's national office, including an increase of 50% in the employment allowance, the restoration of variable fuel tax, the introduction of a travel check and the limitation of rental fees.
Since UMP and NC voted against examining articles in proportion to 180:115, the discussion of the government party and the opposition, sometimes in sharp speeches, was interrupted. This was only a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy’s television speech on purchasing power.
Jean-Marc Ayratt, Head of Socialist Delegation, announced that all its proposals would be submitted again in the context of the amendment of the draft corrective financial law, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A New Festival Is Born
A number of rumours about the new Philadelphia music festival to be organised by C3 Presentations. Now, the event organiser and promoted company announced that the Vineland music festival will be held in cooperation with Melvin Benn’s British producer company, the Festival Republic, in New Jersey.
"It is an honor to work with a man who is the launcher of today's American festival" said to Billboard.com, Charlie Jones from C3.
The C3 organises the festival of Lollapalooza in Chicago and the music festival of Austin City Limits.
The Vineland festival in New Jersey will be held in the summer, so there will be a way to tent.
The festival is held between 8 and 10 August in a 500-month private area about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, formerly known as the Mean Fiddler, is one of the most respectful festival organizers in the world.
In 1989, he started organising the British Reading Festival, which attracts about 80 000 visitors every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn continued to expand his palace with the Leeds Festival organisation, and in 2006 the Festival invited the Latitude Festival to life in Henham Park in Suffolki.
Since 2002 Melvin Benn has been a co-owner in the production, license and organisation of the Glastonbury Festival. This festival has already been able to take up 177 500 people.
The C3 colleague Charlie Jones called the Glastonbury Festival "the most inspiring event" to which he ever participated. He added that his company and Melvin Benn's company work parallelly to a European-style festival.
"The scene in Philadelphia was chosen earlier, and the Fairmount Parks Committee and I worked hard on it to settle this festival in the centre of Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We continued to negotiate with the city, and the Commission showed great enthusiasm for our plan.
But unfortunately, because of the political maneuver of the city leadership, the organization was drowned," continued Charlie Jones.
"We've been able to talk about this with Melvin Benn, and now we're preparing for a huge festival at another unique location, which ultimately serves the interests of the people of Philadelphia."
The C3 Presents re-established the Lollapaloza festival in Grant Park, Chicago, after having already proven its talents in 2002 by exceptional festival organizers of Austin City Limits.
The gross revenue of the two events in 2007 was 9.8 million and $11.3 million.
Both festivals were held at city scenes.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is built on a rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way and create both the rural atmosphere in Europe and the life in America.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland's population, and even the mayor himself, is inclined to support the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not talk about the details of the agreement, he says that "the conditions are favourable enough to allow investment in such a event at a place that hopefully gives the festival home for a long time".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival is going to be a "horrial" size, its capacity to receive is largely equivalent to the capacity of 80 000 people at the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennasse.
The bands have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
"Vineland is going to be a rock festival, but we're planning a variety of music offerings that everyone finds a pleasure in it," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles At, are together with the company C3, which received the most recent Billboard Touring Awardson's "best independent event organizer".
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to seduce Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight the Terminator...
"training" is one of the tasks of the people sent by Montreal.
The mission promises "politically difficult" as the governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger is opposed to the rotation of his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight "Terminator Governor"?
"We have to be careful, because the film industry itself decides which is the best place for it.
If he finds that the conditions are favourable in Montreal, he'll go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions to choose for us," says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for Festivals
Denis Turcotte, however, is now most focused on promoting Canadian films.
Because the competition for the Oscars has started.
The goal is to present and promote more quotec films at every American film festival, whether the Sundance Film Festival or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The L'Âge des ténèbres film was welcomed a few weeks ago at the 30. Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, they're going to play at the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake Hands with the Devil is also presented in Santa Monica and in November 30 at Starz Denver Film Festival.
Quebec also represented himself with four short films and four play movies this month at the American Film Institute Fest event.
Will the end of the year be a rally on the stock exchange? Experts share their opinions in the "subprime" crisis
Less than five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already shaking their hands and looking forward to the end of the normal year.
However, this year, it is not clear for experts that this is really going to happen.
According to Banif, "in statistical terms, in December, the stock exchange usually behaves positively.
However, only statistical forecasts are not necessarily correct, and in the current situation, uncertainty is characterised by the market, at least in the short term."
The experts are not at risk of arguing the growth of the stock market at the end of the year, although they say that "the presence of the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, this will give the opportunity to invest, as there are no alternatives with a guarantee, in particular the fixed yield, which is negatively affected by the return to quality securities, as long as in the short term".
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will be characterised by side-side movements, not free of volatility, "mainly because the effect of the Fed-rate reduction is unknown, because the price of raw oil is high and is also a threat to inflation."
Javier Barrio, responsible for the sale of BPI in Spain, agrees with this, which means that it would also be risky to declare that it would be a rally.
The expert says, "It's definitely not a rose situation."
Ibex's loss is almost 4% compared to the highest values registered on November 8, when index is closed at 15.945,7 points.
Despite all this, not all experts are so ugly.
According to Juan Solana, Intermoney's analyst, Ibex 35 can close the year closer to 16.000 points due to the reorganisation of wallets and the payments to the usual pension fund at this time.
On the other hand, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, since the Rally will be delayed for the second week of December, after the long weekend of the Constitution's holiday.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, the Inversi Banco analyst, we are close to the technical level and we can see "the fall in the stock exchange index, which may also rise, depending on the news from the USA, as regards the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on what will be the securities to achieve Ibex's new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, stresses that "the big securities are on line this year."
The expert would list the two large banks and some construction companies, "when the electricity sector will be very expensive by then".
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco states that the rise is due to the banking sector and the industry.
The Rally can also be positive for construction companies, of course, if it does.
"ACS has been trying to recover its positions for several months and we hope that Ferrovia and the FCC builders will follow this road," says the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be the main factor for the remainder of the year due to the increase in sales during Christmas sales.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies can also be good, although the representativeness in the Spanish market is not too high in this field.
Five times in seven years
Over the past seven years, only two times a December exchange occurred.
The end of the real year was observed in 2003 when the stock markets ran out of the crisis caused by the extinction of technology bubbles.
This year, when Ibex regulated 28.17 percent, a 6.68% jump was registered in December.
So it is still open to whether the fifth successive year of 2007 will be (approximately Ibex shows 8.36% growth since January) and whether the final rally may occur.
Banco Popular Español opens a account open for 12 hours from 200 Mondays to Saturday
Banco Popular Español decided to rebuild most of his accounts.
In total, it concerns 200 accounts located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and make a big change for the bank.
However, for the other Spanish institutions, it is the first group whose accounts are kept open in an orderly manner until 20.30 p.m. and even on Saturdays from 10 p.m. until 20.30.
The other group, the BBVA, which also repeatedly said that its accounts were planning to maintain extended openness, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's just about to make an agreement with the trade unions to close 75% of his accounts to open it in exchange for one afternoon, although not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions, as they will decide on this basis whether they will join a more favourable initiative to support business opening.
This is exactly the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
I would like to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local business in these places.
Overall, the Bank wishes to operate 200 branches of Spain with the above mentioned open-keeping for 18 months, because it is not a new opening regime, but an existing restructuring.
To this end, the institution modernises its branches in commercial zones according to the needs of customers in each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening time is accompanied by a new concept of the nature of the accounts, a more modern, more colorful design.
The responsibility of the commercial banks, Ángel Rivera, points out that there is no need for high investment in restructuring, but more employees need to be involved, which means eight or nine employees per branch, instead of the current six.
The branches in which even the negotiators established for SMEs are located will also sell non-financial products.
Favourable experience
Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in three Madrid accounts.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experience was positive.
In Madrid, Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets were selected, and Rivero found that the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2.500 accounts.
More 60 Mundocredit works under the name, specializes in immigrants, and also has very favourable opening orders, even on Sundays and holidays.
The units mentioned by PopularMax do not use the BBVA model where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our clients," says Rivero.
At the moment, they have agreed with Telefonica and will sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco first doubles rivalisa, Antena 3 stock exchanges
"We did it."
In this sentence, Paolo Vasile, the commissioner of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the end of the market, when it found that the TV provider led him doubled the value of Antena 3.
Yet one thing impeded his joy: "It only hurts that it is not because we have risen more, but because we have fallen less," he said.
He has even placed great emphasis on "we have fallen less on the weak market".
Telecinco closed with a 2.54 percent increase yesterday.
This increase places its annual loss to 15.66 per cent.
52 percent of the company owns Mediaset, 13 percent belongs to Vocento, so the stock exchange value is EUR 4.488.88 million according to Bloomberg's data.
Rivalisa, the Antena 3 lost 1.52 per cent yesterday, and since January, he could account for a fall of 40,5 per cent, so yesterday half the amount was 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other registered communications companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; the value for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Dias) is 2.518,53 million and for Vocento is 1.779 million.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is a similarity between the two companies.
The question is just how much we can accomplish on the same market, with what costs and how to repay all of this in terms of ratings.
Telecinco announced last week that he would like to be the first TV channel that exceeds the gross 1 billion advertising revenues this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, Counsellor of Telecinco and Publicespaña.
If the declared fact is fulfilled, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6 per cent compared to 965.4 million recorded in the 2006 financial year this year.
The net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the financial year (which reached 734,4 million), while the net turnover of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630,4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors that triggered the volatility of Telecinco's stock exchanges is the high payout that has been maintained so far: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarría divided 100% of the profits of the company managed by President Echevarría.
According to Vasile, although it would be too early to decide, this ratio may change with the parent company, associated with the Mediaset after taking 33% of Endemol.
"We guarantee a minimum of 50% of payments, although we have always allocated much more.
I hope our shareholders will be satisfied this year, because we have already benefited them by the acquisition of 33 percent of Endemol."
According to analysts, the market is currently characterised by some deterioration.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced the profitability estimates for Telecinco by 4 per cent in 2008 and 2009 by 7 per cent.
They say that this is due to the estimated increase in turnover from 10,5 per cent in 2008 to 8.4 per cent and from 5.5 per cent in 2009 to 5.1 per cent.
According to the same company’s forecasts, Antena 3’s profits will fall by 4.5 per cent in 2008 and by 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
( See opening picture.)
Ibersecurities: proposes the purchase of both securities, mainly due to the high rentability of dividends and its long-term sustainable potential.
There are several ways that are redirected.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco is more favourable (purchase) than Antena 3 (reservation) due to its "multifold attractiveness" and business intensification.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, underestimation is proposed due to "like risks" (comprehensive market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approved the adoption of MiFID on 1 November
In parallel to the parliamentary session, which today ended with the Congress vote approving the amendments of the Senate, the government has launched a social dialogue on the regulation under the law so that both can enter into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups have consistently highlighted the efforts of representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements to develop the most favourable standard for investors and to provide detailed regulation of the business activities of companies in order to function effectively on the market.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, allows the modernisation of the financial markets, at the same time strengthens the protection of investors, broadens the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new direction allows financial advisory services to be established by specialised companies, but also by natural or legal persons, as well as with securities trading companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, a new form of financial service provider (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFIs).
Moreover, the law increases the number of systems capable of carrying out operations involving funds, thus adding multilateral trading platforms to regulated secondary markets and internalisation systems for the execution of mandates, which are competing with current stockholders.
In addition, the Law obliges investment service providers to provide market information on the specific aspects of their business profile, on risk management and on the risk management methods, and shall keep records of all operations carried out in order to facilitate the verification of CNMV.
The Economic Committee of the Congress has entered a number of amendments, of which it is of particular importance that securitised debts are treated as a "complex" currency, due to the high risk of investors. This is confirmed in connection with high-risk mortgages in the United States (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the direction was also used to legally circulate the scope of activities of economic and entrepreneurial qualifications, 30 years after the Royal Regulation determining the professional functions that only economists can carry out in 1977.
The Senate also proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as the intermediary agent who works on other accounts, does not need the authorisation of CNMV and can at the same time sell products to several investors or buy clients.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account for the calculation of the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for November.
Its publication is in line with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data comparable to data from the United States, both in terms of time and their nature.
The preliminary indicator shall be used to calculate the same method of calculation as the Harmonised Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs from the assessment of information that is not yet available at the moment of disclosure.
The Statistical Office stressed that the pre-definitive indicator is purely indicative and could therefore differ from the final data published on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index remains relatively high."
Pedro Solbes, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Government and the Minister of Economic Affairs, stated that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November is only "premature" but also predicted that the price index would be expected to represent a "reportable high" value in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not really favourable", the inflation rate in Spain has remained at the same level as in the monetary union in recent years.
He also added that the November month brought less surprises than the previous month when the government did not count with such great growth.
"Wait for a value of about 4 %" has been recognised by the Economic Minister on the data published today.
Under Northern Rock, Virgin wants to reach 42 billion euros over three years.
Northern Rock's deposits have been recovered by more than 50% and currently only 12 billion pounds (16 billion EUR 800 million) since they have been in crisis and had to take urgent credit from the English National Bank since mid-September.
Then he had a record deposit of more than 25 billion pounds, with a gradual reduction in the number of deposits over the past two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of customers, despite the fact that the government promised a 100% guarantee to the bank at the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial, commercial name, Virgin Money. Virgin will have to obtain about a quarter of the income of the British banks in the next three years to obtain the remaining 18 billion pounds and thus reach the 30 billion target.
Richard Branson’s group, a highly respected businessman, has become known by the high-ranking advertising campaigns in England, intends to spend about 50 million pounds per year (EUR 70 million) on advertising and marketing to reach the target set.
Northern Rock has highlighted the offer of the Virgin consortium this week as the most favorable to avoid bankruptcy, along with Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for a suspected corruption case.
He arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, located in Murcia, this morning, as the People's Party is suspected of being involved in the urban corruption scandal that was exploded this week.
Aside from him, one of the city hall secretarys and the local police chief were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo, a former member of the town council, took over Juan Morales of the People's Party in May, who, according to the official bodies asked by the SER radio channel, may have been head of the corruption network.
The police are further investigating the city's offices and the City Development Council and it cannot be excluded that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer was also investigated as the main suspect of corruption scandal this week.
According to the information from the SER radio station, the lawyer of the People's Party, Juan Morales, was arrested when he just left Morales with the documentation on corruption in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the presumed commission Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a Galician construction company to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are under arrest.
Mr Bono accepts PSOE's nomination in Toledo and the President of Parliament if they win the elections.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, accepted the proposal of the Head of Government and the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE's list of attendants at the next parliamentary elections and to complete the presidential office of Parliament if the socialists win the elections.
This was announced by the PSOE Organization Secretary, José Blanci, at a press conference and Bono himself confirmed the party in the federal center after a meeting with Zapatero at noon today.
The Prime Minister justified his election to the former Minister by "we have to count with the best" in politics, and Bono is among the best."
In addition, he added that "probably" the Manchai politician will be the candidate of the Socialist party to the President of Parliament if the socialists win at the forthcoming elections.
Mr Bono would take over the position of the current Parliamentary President Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he was not intending to go to the next elections and, giving up his political career, will fight climate change in scientific circles.
The former Minister acknowledged that the Governing Council continued to purchase to return to the political scene since he had ceased to be active politics two years ago.
He also added that since the electorates are aware of who will be the Vice-President in the event of the victory of the socialists, the party wanted to inform them who would be the President of Parliament.
If Bono is really going to fill the post, he would like Parliament to have "respect and not the color of insulting or screaming" and more similar to citizens' homes.
"Sometimes, unfortunately, Parliament seems to be the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to talk freely, there has been a 26-time interruption of the Prime Minister's speech in the Senate."
At the same time, he welcomed the current President, Manuel Marín, his "great work", but he did not want to make himself a President, not to be regarded as a "objective" by his opponents.
Campaign for the climate
Since the climate change movement is unbarmiliatedly pursued by both skeptical conductors against its forecasts and those who prefer political or social battles must be very strong.
In fact, you must put on your side a political leader like the Prime Minister Zapatero, who believes that movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and declares that we have to conclude a new agreement with our Earth.
However, this remark raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government contributed to Spain's leadership within the Union in the non-compliance of the Kyoto Convention.
Who are responsible for the non-compliance of the Convention, which sector is affected and why did the government not seek to avoid this?
In addition, the Spanish authorities should clearly explain what measures they intend to take to tackle climate change.
What companies will be affected by these measures, the habits of the population, the individual and social energy savings, and what economic consequences?
So who needs to sacrifice and who must pay to save our Earth?
But we didn't get or will not get any explanations for these questions.
It's because it's sacrifice and money.
Climate change has taken measures, actual measures are always unfavourable.
Cost, uncomfortable and cost-effective for both companies and the population.
Even the rising of PSOE would have been so unfamiliar before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrawn.
So the earth must be saved from nowhere, simply propaganda texts, empty passwords free of actual consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new offices.
The Earth agreement, as the Head of Government, who speaks so nicely in the election campaign, does not demand, attacks, even builds election meetings and raises tenderness in us.
You know what?
They arrested the mayor of Totana and the chief of police for a suspected corruption case.
The Church arrested the Mayor of the City of Totana, Murcai Province, José Martínez Andreot, the People's Party, the local police chief, the Secretary of the City Hall and a gastronomy businessman for crimes related to urban development, has been informed today by police resources.
The mayor was arrested in his home and then transferred to the City Hall, and is currently present with several police officers, many of whom are investigating in the City Development Council and the municipal body responsible for managing the Industries and Houses.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrest of six persons in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia last Monday in relation to a case where 2 hectares of agricultural land were reclassified to permit the construction of 4000 apartments to the Galician company Nuaria after illegally paid commissions to the leaders during their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation according to the information provided by the Court of Justice of Totala.
The first arrested six persons were transferred to the court.
According to official sources, the former mayor of Totana, Juan Morales, who today is also under investigation by the independent MEP of the People's Party.
The ex-wife, who is the owner of a property agency registered in Totana, is also investigated as well as the current friend of the previous mayor who lives in the center of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigeria (Pontevedra), along with the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company Pablo José M.G. This company is also a member of the Nuaria Group and has been compensated through it.
The investigation is carried out by a group of the Operational Central Unit, responsible for crimes committed at the self-government level, whose members carried out 11 house searches outside the arrests, in particular in companies related to arrested persons, which operate in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the area, who could have been a mediator in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in Totana, where 5000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels were built.
The company acquired 2,2 million square metres of area in Totana, which was reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the municipality with 25,000 currently residents.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Vigoban, Conycase, dedicated to the parking lots of Coruna, Venezuelan streets and the Catolian Ferdinand Square, specialised in direct marketing Hogartel and Preconiza for sale, promotion and installation of building elements.
Things that happen

If you agree, we'll put away the Month Book and see if we can learn some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already equipped one.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, everyone can figure something out for themselves.
There are several ways that are redirected.
Our Finnish correspondent found this comment in one of Finland's largest newspapers: (whether at the top of the PISA report on the world's educational level), in Helsinki Sanomat, referring to what was published at the same time as the Blackburn book on 18 November.
"The philosophical teachings came to the public after the tragedy of the Jokela high school.
He quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche in the messages of the killer, a student in the preschool.
The philosophical Council of Education, Pekka Elo, entrusted with teaching, called on the pages of the Helsinki Sanomat newspaper to examine Plato’s teachings with a critical eye and added that Nietzsche’s knowledge is not necessarily important in compulsory basic philosophic classes of secondary schools."

One of his colleagues will inform us that the Criminal Code contains a misconduct of downloads on the Internet:
A. Downloading a music number is a mistake, and you can be punished for a year from six months.
But if you steal a plate worth less than EUR 400 in a store, it's just a violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal 1000 euros in a store, stealing is already a crime, but the penalty still does not reach the level of penalty applicable for downloading the Internet (Article 234 BTK).
C. If you steal a car but return it back in 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the level of penalty applicable for downloading the Internet (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect less punishment if you get into a fight than copy CDs.
If you participate in a massage, you can receive a penalty from three months to one year (Article 154 of the BTK), but a penalty from six months to two years for CD copying
(Article 270 BTK).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as severe as downloading a DVD film.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected films without the consent of the authors is more severely punishable than the sale of pornographic materials to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague's right, somebody's got things out of their hands.
Amount to pay (EUR 4).
My doctor gave me an article on strange research with the title "The money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less."
So, the feelings of the employees on the day of their salary depend on how much the rest of them got.
The experiment was carried out at the University of Bonn, with the tomato measurement of magnetic resonances, and the results were published in the latest number of Sciences.
The author of the study and the head of the Group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, Bernd Weber, said: "The strongest activity was measured when the participant answered correctly, but the partner made a mistake."
Researchers found that if both of them were given the right answer and received the same money, the brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received a double amount, the activity also increased.
I have no idea why such a great science was needed for such a simple conclusion.
Attorney General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been chasing the Balkan war criminals for eight years from the Office of the Criminal Court of Justice on crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
His mandate ends at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a bit bitter mouth, as the responsible men of Srebrenica's assault, during which 8000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred, namely General Ratko Mladic and the Serbian Bosnian leader Radovan Karadsics are still on the loose.
Their names are on the list chosen by the Swiss director Marcel Schübbach to the title of his documentary: Carla's list (2006, not yet presented in Spain). The film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York as he tries to pressure the governments concerned to need the curtains around the fugitive sinners.
What kind of insurance does it match me?
Automobile insurance, which provides security for the owner of the car, is a significant cost against different accidents and also depends on several factors such as age, sex, date of receipt of the licence, family status, type of vehicle and type of use to be provided.
Getting the car is just the first step.
In fact, it is often harder to choose the right insurance than to decide what kind of car we want.
First of all, we need to know what this is about.
Car insurance is the agreement between the insurance company and the insurance undertaking.
This agreement is carried out in the form of a insurance contract, which states that the insurance company is to accept compensation for damages in the event of an accident in the course of a fixed insurance premium.
The insurance premium is practically the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, date of receipt of the licence, family status, type of car to be guaranteed, its use, and others.
Insurance companies shall determine the insurance premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. pay a higher amount to the higher risk of accidents.
That is why women over the age of 25 or less pay because statistics show that they represent a smaller risk because they are more careful.
Similarly, the findings show that insurance companies concluded that married people would cause less accidents than lonely people.
For the type of vehicle use, the frequency is the final.
More frequent use increases the possibility of an accident.
A number of factors are taken into account when determining the insurance premium.
Therefore, the owner must examine carefully to select the most appropriate insurance form of his profile.
The following are the most important elements of the choice to make it best possible to adapt to the needs of the provider and to create an acceptable price.
When the insurance contract is concluded, under the age of 25, people will have to report a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and the freshness of the licence.
Although the most ideal is that we are secured against all dangers, there are more economic solutions.
Precautionary leaders can make full insurance with themselves, thus guaranteeing all dangers, and the price will be affordable.
For such a type of contract, the insurer pays part of the damage.
"The level of self-assessment payable by the insurer depends on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the self-participation," says Luis Noguera, the manager of the internet insurance intermediary in Spain of First Europa.
Another option is the increased liability insurance for third parties when the client is providing itself against the damage caused to others, but not against the damage caused by its own car.
In addition, it will be secured against stealing, firefighting and the loss of the car.
It's a good advice.
If you are not yet 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents, as this has an impact on the bonus and can reduce the amount to be paid in the future.
The discounts granted to the insurance company in comparison with the basic tariff are called bonus.
Compared to the basic rate, the penalty which has been abolished is referred to as a marshmallow.
"The bonus and the amount of the marshmallow depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company had been a good year, you can afford to increase the bonus rate," explains Noguera.
Since they have exceeded the age of 25, it is easier for owners to make adequate insurance, as accident risk decreases due to experience gained over the years.
Then we advise you to make full insurance with yourself.
"Altaly, young people are not able to properly apply their experience during an accident or even driving," says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the leaders have already been beyond the fear of the starters.
If the insurance provider is already married but has no children yet, it is best to make a full insurance, of course, if his financial options allow this.
Insurers consider the child couples to be the least risky customers, so in their case the fee to be paid is lower.
In this case, full insurance is best (may reach 300 euros) or if they have a higher bonus, they may extend the insurance from the third year of the vehicle to the damage caused to others.
"They drive more relaxed, but at the same time they have a greater customer power and they can afford to have a higher part of themselves," confirms Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, we offer full insurance (approximately €150) or for higher bonuses to be extended to liability insurance.
Automobile insurance is very important, not only because it represents protection for the owner in the event of damages, but also because it means a high cost, and therefore it is essential that we choose a properly personalised form of insurance.
Celtic is trying to get a point in Milan to get into the eighth.
Milan and Celtic will measure their strength in the San Siro stadium to get the missing point when the League of Champions is closed, and the Italians may be the first to qualify themselves.
The Italians have a total of ten points and already secured progress in the fifth round with an indefinite with Portugal, but Celtic has nine points, but one more should be the six-point Shakhtar who will fight the four-point Benfica.
Two games of the D group will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play in Japan at the Club Championship, where on the 13th of the Preliminary, he tries to fight the transition to the 16th Final.
This group D will be closed sooner than the others, and although the most likely result in Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be the unfinished one, the two teams will seek to win because the Italians do not want to miss home, and Celtic can first start a better place in the eighth.
Gordon Strachan's team's defeat is enough to qualify itself if Shakhtar does not win, but can't be sure, because if there's a correlation, the Ukrainians are going to get on, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but have won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to frustrate the night of the Scots, who would like to enter the eighth of the League of the Transsolute Champions twice after each other, after a galle of Kaka got out in the previous season in the 0-0 final extension (1-0).
The Shakhtar winner of "Rossonerik" would be most pleased, because if you lose the Celtic, you'll be in the eighth and you'll stay in the UEFA.
Since Benfica, despite the fact that she is currently in the last place and is unable to stay in the European Championship, you can still get the third place with a victory to play in the UEFA.
20.000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of Spice Girls' tour.
Spice Girls in Vancouver (Kanada) started its tour, the first step was taken before 20.000 audiences since they split up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Geri Halliwell" were announced a few minutes before the concert organised in Vancouver GM Place was in the form of "rems".
Around 20.000 people changed their tickets to be at the concert, where a video has been presented with a huge success of the story of a band that has been created in the 1990s.
A new album was placed on the market in Spain, together with the reconstruction of the band and the tour, and the EMI, which also includes the larger slagers and two new songs "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five members of Spice Girls from the husband of "Push Spice", the British football player David Beckham, went to the stage.
The athlete was also at GM Place's viewer, although a few days earlier Victoria banned it.
When the performance was ranged, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "she hasn't seen our performing clothes yet, so I'm nervous about what he'll think of the performance."
"Sporty Spice" was the reason why the band split two years after he left the band in 1998, "because the members didn't understand each other." He seemed nervous during the press conference that was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings for Spice Girls changed.
I thought, why not, now I'm glad that I decided," said Chisholm about the band that was dispersed nine years earlier.
The singer also added that, in time, things were settled and we loved each other very much.
But a lot of things have changed since Spice Girls last started in 1998.
According to CTV TV information, Virgin Airlines has arrived in Vancouver on a special machine.
At the airport, a bunch of baby-sitters were waiting for them.
Five of them have seven children in total.
After the Vancouver concert, the team performs in California (USA), then in San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7)
They'll be in Madrid on 23 December.
Another fear of the Russian-Ukraine gas dispute
The gas charging between Ukraine and Russia, which may also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) will be passed through Ukraine and disputes between the two nations are always of great attention.
Kiev stated that if Moscow raises the gas price to be paid by the Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia with higher transit costs.
As a result of a previous debate that was exploded last year between the two countries, the supply to EU countries has decreased.
The most recent debate between Kiev and Moscow relates to the attempt to reach an agreement between the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly, Gazprom, on the level of the gas price to be paid to Russia in 2008 by Ukraine.
Gazprom stated that for the gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan, a 50% increase should be made in comparison to the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008.
According to analysts, this could lead to an increase of 40% in prices for Ukraine from Gazprom.
"It is important that we argue during the negotiations in line with one of the most important transit states for gas transport", said Anatoly Kinah, Minister of Economic Affairs of Ukraine, to the Reuters News Agency.
"A change in gas prices should definitely be linked to the debate on the extent of the costs of transit to Ukraine (and to Western Europe)."
As a result of the recent major gas supply between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas trap leading to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a dominant decrease in exports to Western Europe, which also raised high prices.
A quarter of the gas supply of the European Union is produced by Russian gas.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but most of these are still undetectable.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet States in Central Asia.
The NHS is "eligible to check foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS committees should improve the control of the criminal records of workers from outside Europe, said a supervisory body.
The proposal was made by Robert Black’s main accountant after a doctor with a foreign nationality in Scotland was linked to the attack on the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black was also concerned that NHS Scotland did not have accurate data on the number of workers in the overseas.
At the same time, in his report, through the model of five health authorities, he also pointed out key controls that have been carried out properly.
Following the attack on the airport in Glasgow, the main accountant checked the list of employees recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullah, a doctor from the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep drove to the main hall of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who were interviewed by the Old Bailey court in October on the charges of car bombing attempts in the United Kingdom.
In the case of their employees from overseas countries, the NHS committees should check the existence of the qualifications and experience of the workers concerned and the provision of licences for employment in the United Kingdom before starting employment.
Although the Scottish Health Committees apply Disclosure Scotland to verify the criminal records, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the territory of the United Kingdom.
The main accountant report proposed, inter alia, that the committees should introduce a guide from the Criminal Register Office, which facilitates the employer's inspection processes with different overseas countries.
"While we have found evidence of such checks among the personnel records, they are not carried out regularly," says the report.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS has been carrying out its own pre-employment examination procedure at a high level, adding: "The report highlights the areas that can be developed in order to provide up-to-date information on the number of NHS personnel from overseas. "
Dr. Peter Terry, President of the BMA Scotland, said that it is "experienced" to identify potential NHS employees who can commit terrorist acts in the future by means of pre-employment checks.
"The report states that the current pre-employment checks work well in NHS Scotland and that the value of the proposals is not yet transparent" added.
According to the Dutch health authorities, the majority of their overseas employees are 1161.
However, the main accountant pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, which is partly explained by the fact that it is a problem for the committees to identify workers on a fixed-term leave.
The investigation has also shown that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Arran area, in the Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, in Lanarkshire and in the NHS authorities in Lothian are highly coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, employment permits and evidence of professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the NHS directive and guidance on pre-employment checks for employees from overseas countries.
Nicola Sturgeon's health secretary said: "I was so glad that you managed to carry out this task after the attack on Glasgow airport.
In addition, he added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals in the report and will ensure that the updated Guideline on Pre-employment Controls for Full Employees, including Overseas, reflects the best practical application. The updated version is planned to be published in the following month.

In Saudi Arabia, 208 people were arrested for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia published yesterday that 208 militants were arrested in terrorist cells, who were designed to carry out a coming attack on the oil facility, and several attacks on churches and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one cell wanted to smuggle missiles.
The supporters of Al-Qaida have launched a battle against the monarchy, which has been active as an ally of the United States since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
According to the television report, eight-person cells led by a foreign national resident are designed to attack an oil facility in the eastern province.
After the 2006 attack attempt against the world's largest oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Al-Qaida, Saudi-Arabia began to build a power of 35 000 people with rapid response to the protection of installations.
According to a report quoted by the Minister of Interior, 18 of the arrests belong to a cell leading to a "specialized person for missile shootings" that crosses the country's borders illegally.
The report also reported that the warriors tried to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom territory.
22 of the prisoners had plans to commit attacks on church leaders and security forces.
The government has called on the church leaders to fight a harder action against the Al-Qaida warriors that flow to Iraq, who are fighting the allies and the US-supervised Sicily Muslim government.
The Al-Qaida warriors are viewed as being involved by the authorities in the policy of the royal family governing the government for a significant part of the Saudi Arabia.
The warriors of the organization, inspired by the call made by Al-Qaida's birth leader, Osama bin Laden, to target the government of the Western Friend Saudi Arabia, were targeted at attacks on foreign resident settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
"Safety forces have made great efforts in the past five months" said a public television spokesman at the Ministry of Home Affairs.
During the arrests, a 16-person media cell was also captured in Medina, which was intended to spread the "takfiri thinking". Takfiri thinking is the ideology of the sonnital Muslim radicals, which supports the violence against the Muslims that have been tainted to the unfaithful and deceased.
The arresters also included 32 persons charged with the financial support of the militants.
The Venus climate can provide a view of the future of the Earth
According to the Scientists yesterday, Venus could once provide pleasant living conditions.
The data of a European circular spaceship indicate that this planet is much more considered a world’s circulatory twin brother than we thought it was.
Venus is the nearest planet's neighbourhood on Earth.
The size of the two planets is almost the same and their circling course is similar, although Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
According to scientists today, several billion years ago, the Venus could have dominated very similar living conditions and even living conditions.
However, as a result of the exploding high CO2 glass houses, the atmospheric erosion caused by sunshine and the smaller rotation rate of the planet, Venus entered a different course of development.
Today the water has diluted from the planet, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and hurricane winds and lightning storms destroy.
The findings of the Venus Express Space Zone of the European Space Agency, based on the study of the planet for a year, reflect an exaggerating picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes can occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor of physics at Oxford University, who is one of the heads of the Venus Express mission, said: "Read to draw up why the Venus climate differs so much from the experience on Earth, despite the fact that the two planets are otherwise very similar.
"On the basis of our new data, it was possible to develop a scenario of the Venus a billions of years ago, when it could have had a similar living conditions as the Earth.
The police's booked "extended uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was taken yesterday by the Slovak and the Hungarian police.
According to a police officer, three men were arrested and the material was investigated.
The spokesman did not confirm whether it was an enriched uranium, but he declared that the material could have been sold for a million dollars (400,000 pounds).
Broad doors
According to Mitt Romney, he is not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
However, the candidates of the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate on YouTube, where ordinary voters put their questions on video and forwarded them to candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night 28 November proved as ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in his debate on YouTube from the other party.
However, the questions and answers were well reflected in the position of the Republican Party approaching the election for next year.
It is not yet known how the CNN manufacturers who co-financed the debate selected the YouTube clips submitted to the candidates.
The longest issue for the first half of the debate was immigration.
This is one of the Republicans' negotiating couples.
The CNN invited some uncertain voters to call a number if they were to hear a squeeze: the intermediary had a high level of agreement when the candidates strongly expressed the issue of the borders.
The most lively and long-term debate was between Rudy Giuliani at national level and the decisive pre-selection in Iowa and New Hampshire, Romney.
Giuliani is trying to change the image that she had developed during her New York mayorship to deal with the issue of illegal immigration too easily.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants from the former governor of Massachusetts to build his house.
The vocabulary between the two became particularly intense when the questioners asked about the support of "amnesty" (which would provide illegal immigrants with permanent status and the possibility of citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as Duncan Hunter and Tom Tancredo Colorado, have managed to get thoroughly into this issue.
And even though none of them consider it possible to be possible on the marking, their stay on the competition field may be explained by the fact that the other people started to cling the immigration bell faster and louder than the others.
At least there is broad agreement between candidates on the issue of immigration: the common objective is to strengthen borders and to take hard action against illegal immigrants.
This topic - just like fear of Chinese toxic games and other worrying factors from outside the world - helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the gap between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
However, when other kinds of issues were raised, the debate was very unpleasant.
Giuliani had to face the question of why she supported weapons control earlier.
John McCain and Romney were debating the question of whether simulated drilling would be regarded as torture.
Another questioner asked if the candidates believed all the Bible’s words.
In this matter, Giuliani finally stumbled at the point of view that, although her favorite book was viewing the Bible, Jonah and the whale might not be literally interpreted.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
This is what Mike Huckabee, who, thanks to his victory, has responded to the expectations that the death penalty is painful, but it is necessary.
When they were concerned that Jesus would receive sufficient support, laughing at him, he said that Jesus was more wise than going to the elections.
The competition remains unusually open.
The stimulus of Huckabee iowa is consistent with the libertarian Ron Paul's money collector's mission and the enthusiasm of the debate on Wednesday.
The sudden break-up of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet been able to launch a joint candidate from the more familiar and traditional principles.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who in time and convincingly stirred the victory message that proclaimed the greatness of America, and who found the joint voice with both wings of the party.
However, now the party is shared, and the consequences of this are inaccurate for the time being.
Working party pain
Another break-off before Gordon Brown; the way out is unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, it doesn't seem too frivolous.
No one sold his honor, no politician had received any hotel accounts in Paris, no one made a scandal outside of marriage.
However, the discovery of a wealthy businessman under the name of others for more than four years, with a sum of more than 650 000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) incredibly contributed to the Labour Party governing the Great Britain, and that the party did not report this, one of the things that the surrounded Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister escaped the election and, with his statement that public opinion surveys did not influence the outcome of the decision, he unwisely questioned the British intelligence ability, people were still hoping that Brown would provide a strong and effective governance.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the vice president of the liberal Democrats, noted that the feared Brown from Stalin was transformed into Mr. Bean.
The failure to save a bank called Northern Rock has crossed the regulatory weaknesses and deficiencies in judgment.
The patient proposals to change the tax law have encouraged business stakeholders to intervene with the government.
The loss of 25 million people's personal data by the tax administration has unthinkablely revealed a high level of administrative instability.
In the Lords' House, three retired generals who protested against the reduction of the army's budget, stating that the state minister's position was part-time employment.
And here are the mysterious gifts of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary-General of the Labour Party, has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way out.
At the same time, governments can reach the point after which control is inevitable.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually stop their infidelity.
However, as it turns out that the Prime Minister is very likely not able to advance things and perhaps not to stay on his post for a long time, the suspended infidelity ends: the civil servants' arm begins to leak out, the Cabinet Ministers will be briefed, the press will look after bad oral news; and the government will start to defend and cannot concentrate.
In a certain sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation, because, unlike other political leaders, he does not count as "fresh blood".
As much as he wants to deny his relationship with Tony Blair, he was still his right hand.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and tax administration records relate, for example, to decisions taken during Brown's Ministry of Finance.
And although the long-term examination of the relationship between Blair's failures, such as "cash nobleness" and political party funding, was not directly involved, the voters may have the right to assume the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is very unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it seems.
The shootings committed are not as scary as the towers indicate.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly on it.
Compensation, however painful, can always create the trends promised by Stalin in Brown: reliable, solid and a little hard-handed governance.
For example, it's a good service for a faithful man around political donation.
The garboian suspicious Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, stated that he did not want his goodwill to be revealed to the public.
Perhaps so, however, it was not his responsibility to make a decision.
The law prohibiting the anonymisation of major political supporters is clear and clearly justified: the public has the right to know who knocks on the gates of the country's leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, knew about Abrahams' action, but was not aware of the illegal nature of it, will certainly be sweated during the interrogation, just like Jon Medleson, the founding director of the Working Party, who was aware of the confusing donations in October.
For now, however, the lines do not lead to Brown: nothing indicates that he knew about these cables, not even that the huge sums were paid after the entry into office of Brown in June.
Until now, he has done half the role of the Prime Minister.
Although his party condemned the offences early, he blew his strength to reach a familiar instrument; he commissioned a committee under the leadership of a retired bishop and a judge to investigate the case, in the interests of security.
In this story, "the lesson to learn" isn't very complicated.
In the event of a breach, the police are responsible.
In addition, Brown needs to regulate other things, such as the appointment of the chairman of an independent committee negotiating administrative rules six months ago or the advancement of an effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard-fishing Working Party to cooperate with the tors and break up with special financial relations with associations - this would be a tough wall for the party Brown.
But you should face some of the facts of the party.
According to surveys, the conservatives are currently taking a serious advantage; Brown has two years to reap the voters behind itself; the only way to make victory is indecent integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Is the second-market credit market crisis jeopardising the American credit card market?
If blood goes into the water, it's natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the American housing market is weakening, the predators are focusing on the country's credit card market.
The Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of retail loans, the loss of the credit card market could reach up to $99 billion.
The signs of the voltage are clearly visible.
It has increased both the descriptive rate on the ratio of inadmissible loans and the deficit rate on late payments over 30 days.
HSBC reported a loss of 1.4 billion dollars last month in the American Consumer Financing segment, partly due to the financial weakness of card holders.
At the same time, panics are still early.
The proportion of descriptions and late payments remains low.
Moody's credit rating agency accounted for 3.89% late payment rates for the third quarter by a total percentage point below the historical average.
The decrease in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
Changes in the American rules of individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sudden reduction in the number of insolvency registrants, while a large loss in the credit card market; a recurrence of the number of bankruptcy claims (and thus the description ratio) is expected, regardless of whether or not the terms of the borrowing are deteriorated.
The payment rate, which shows the rate of monthly credit for consumers, is also solid on the market.
Moreover, trust in securities covered by credit cards is fairly strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney, at the TowerGroup research company, estimates that the volume of 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage market crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers increase debts on credit cards to offset housing loans.
At the same time, card publishers mainly monitor the movement of money and not the value of assets, so the fall in housing prices does not necessarily lead to a change in the creditworthiness of creditors.
For creditors, the situation that has emerged may be beneficial.
If the property is less than the hypothetical credit value, the incentive for consumers to repayment of debts on credit cards is reduced; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards is a priority priority.
By changing interest rates or lending limits, card publishers can adapt more quickly and more flexible than mortgage creditors to changing conditions.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of a sudden reflow of assets.
"It's unlikely that one day we'll wake up to completely reassess the loans," says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of gradual decline is far more likely.
If the decreasing prices on the housing market and the decline in lending leads to a recession in America, the industry has no doubt seen a tough future.
It's worth monitoring those predators.
British bankers have declared themselves guilty in the Enron case.
On Wednesday, he confessed to the three British bankers who were brought before the court to investigate their role in fraud with the name of Enron's former financial director, Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially declared themselves innocent for the charge of seven-range fraud, allegedly co-operating with Fastow in a secret fraud that was committed in 2000, with which they wanted to make money on the costs of their employer.
Your trial started in January.
At a court hearing, however, before the American district judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them confessed to their sins of a common fraud.
Three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Greenwich NatWest, became known in Great Britain during the two-year delivery process.
The closure of the investigation of the case initiated after the collapse of Enron in 2001 is still waiting for you in the United States.
The first prosecution against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation to expose Enron's bankruptcy.
The three brokers of NatWest, who had been baptized, were charged to travel to Houston in 2000 to prepare the fraud with Fastow and the Michael Koper, who was the best hand of Fastow at the time.
Fastow, responsible for planning a number of frauds in Enron's bankruptcy, also held the subsidiary of Enron in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any share in the subsidiary, but the three British men knew that the interest was very large.
A company managed by Koper bought the bank's share in the subsidiary of EUR 1 million.
The bankers paid Koper $20,000 to get a share in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company purchases a subsidiary share of $20 million from Greenwich NatWest.
However, the $20 million actually hit the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The prosecution believes that the bankers are 7.3 million, while Fastow, Koper and others got $12,3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed to his double guilt for the collapse of Enron.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently being sentenced to six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Koper's three years and a month's punishment in a prison in Texas.
The three English men could travel to the United States in the head of a $1 million bail, where they are during the trial.
Enron, the seventh largest American company, reported a bankruptcy in December 2001 after the accounting tricks that have been used for years, could no longer cover the millions of debt accumulated and the profitable, but actually loss-making companies.
Due to the collapse, thousands of jobs have disappeared, the market value is over $60 billion and the value of pension funds decreased by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling was sentenced last year for their insolvency.
Skilling is currently in prison for more than 24 years of age.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges imposed on Lay have ceased by the death of the man last year.
No poverty in Moscow
For 54 million dollars, a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine that takes a tank with no interruption of the road between Moscow and Los Angeles.
However, for some Russian rich ones, this amount is only small money.
"18 passengers fit in," said Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"No one has ordered so many seats, because the machines are purchased for private families or corporate managers."
Mr Firer was expecting visitors in the four-day exclusive, Millionary Vásáran, organized in a huge exhibition hall near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods supplier rental stands at the exhibition, in the hope that the Russian new owners are interested in everything, from the mahogany covered yachts to the diamond, 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully observed the bright orange Porsche on the stand next to him.
"Beautiful car, but no trace of our products," he said.
"Privacy planes have the largest market in Russia after the United States."
Looks like the Russian capital swims in money like Dallas did in light times during the oil price explosion.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were considered material here," said Marshall Goldman, the Senior scholarship of the Davis Centre of the Harvard University of Russia and Europe.
Like the Saúd Arabians in the 1970s and Japanese gamblers in the 1990s, the Russians have now promoted the most beautiful poets in the world.
The most exclusive luxurious brands demand their share of the gold waltz.
At another conference organised by the luxury industry in Moscow, the president of Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH, shared their views on how to sell high-value products on markets similar to Russia.
(The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times, organised the conference.)
According to Forbes' list of wealthiest people, 53 billion lives in Russia, with a total of $282 billion.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103 thousand, who can have a total of 670 billion dollars, has established a study conducted by economists of the Economic and Financial Research Centre, an analysis of personal welfare development in the former Soviet Union.
(World Bank data indicate that in 2005 the number of people living under the minimum was 15.8 per cent in Russia.)
"More than a hundred million people live in Moscow, which is why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, representative of the David Morris jewelry store in London.
Nicole attended the market for the first time with the Russian brand distributor, Soho Jewelry Group.
"Every woman has been treated indecently, and men are a real treasure mine."
In the rooms on Sunday nights, two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both themselves and their clients, were considered as millionaires.
"I watched the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said the young Yumatova, who poured into his unique design, like he's already used to this drive.
The fair was organised primarily for the new owners, for brand-oriented Russian customers who are willing to visit a cifran decorated location where Cadillac Escaleds can be found at the same time, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpic ice cream, regular biljart tables, apartments in Dublin and Gund plys bears.
For average people, the ticket costs 30 euros (€44.57).
"Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and best," said Mr Gijrath, who has patriotically placed a place in the Dutch porcelain manufacturer's Royal Delft stand, compared to a wall size, hand-made, blue-speaked rebrandt.
"Russians are more interested in outstanding things, of course."
Indeed, the sellers here said that the rich Russians, based on the Russian stands, have already been aligned with the banana logos with a limited number of brands that would not be able to enter a commercial market.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, and millionaires, spent the place every day to smash.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the director of the King Koil bed company, sold two mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton with golden shears.
Also on the night of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales worker of A1 Moto, who is dealing with a modern alarm for high-quality cars, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170 thousand.
Andrei Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, delivering luxury cars for individual needs, sold three refrigerators to Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon.
Reporters also showed a wheel made for the owner of a Russian casino, which Swarovski reported to be involved with crystals to create the appearance of a roulette wheel.
The price of a set of four pieces: $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants a picture of a circonium cube of wheels made from strip skin or the face of his wife, is not necessarily going to use these objects."
"In the garage of 30-40 cars, he'll keep them safe."
Despite the fact that many of his Russian clients are rich, Karapetian believes that the expression "Russian millionaire" is not a great privilege today, given the sharp increase in the prices of the property there.
"Who bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago, today is probably a millionaire, if not in cash, but at least on paper," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who aren't millionaires could at least have caused the appearance of wealth before the Russian wealth management company Alliance Continental.
The company built four English-style phone cabs that were cumulated with millions of fake dollars banknotes.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, told me that his team printed 500 thousand fake banknotes on the Milliomas Customer.
Many of the visitors stopped playing with the money. Many people took pictures of themselves with a mobile phone like they're in the ring of money, or they just put a few million in their pockets.
"He sees everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," said Karryev.
They suspect a surgical malfunction behind a death in New Jersey.
On the day before Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked out the window of a restaurant called "Such healthier" and saw a ambulance stop at Cape Cod with two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Shortly later, a police patrol came in.
Then another one.
"And then I saw the doctor's car stop," said Mr Livingston, one of the inspectors at the restaurant on Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities have learned that the dead woman is 41 years old, named Olga Arroyo, who used to work as the chief assistant of the head of the police in Newark.
The investigation is currently underway to determine whether death is caused by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon working at West Scott Avenue 212, unidentified by the police.
The authorities have not been able to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of toxicology tests that will become available in a few weeks will reflect this mysterious death, which has been severely affected by the high-ranked staff of the police in New York.
Arroyo, whose voice has been known by many in the department, has been working as an assistant since September 2006 with Garry F. McCarthy, the head of the police.
"He was loyal, busy and reliable," said McCarthy Arroyo in a phone interview on Wednesday.
". He was my housekeeper.
He was my protector."
McCarthy told me that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, who was a former police officer in Newark, who is currently working in the Audit Committee for Sescism Products, and that she left two, a 14 and 11-year-old boys and a siblings behind.
Eileen Walsh, the D.A. of the Union county, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the investigators were working to investigate whether Mrs. Arroyo was victims of an unauthorized surgeon.
"The probability of being up" said Walsh.
"The investigation is currently underway."
According to the reports of the authorities, they arrived at the house at 3 a.m. in November.
The 21st and Mrs. Arroyo were found on the couch.
He was already declared dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed, and the police have just been telling me a little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't tell me if Castro was heard by the detectives.
Participants in the study are examining whether some of the house has functioned as a medical professional.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Castro's home, where a rosebow was in the narrow front garden and a daunted bark from behind the house.
Beside the door to the basement, in the van, there was a blue container with the label "Etil Vanilin" used to replace vanilla in foods and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes hanged side by side from hooks.
McCarthy recalled the first time she arrived in Newark after 25 years of the New York police, Mrs Arroyo was incredibly helpful by helping her to understand the unusual and unfamiliar political culture of the new city.
"He always said, "It'll be better for you to take care of it!" he remembered.
"He was always here when I arrived this morning, and he was always in there when I left tonight.
It was confusing."
The anticipation of Fed's interest cuts leads to the collapse of the world's stock markets
The stock prices jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the reassurance statements by the Vice President of the Central Bank of America increased the hope that the Fed would try to make the investment opportunities more easy.
The stock markets both in London and in New York and across Europe have been gained after Donald Kohn, who claims to be the right hand of Prime Minister Fed Ben Bernanke, has to respond to "free and pragmatic" concerns on financial markets.
In addition to the clear objective of Kohn to reduce the markets in the middle of the renewing credit crisis, he stated that this anxiety “would partially revert market developments in late September and October”.
He said that if the increased disruption continues to persist, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on households and corporate credit conditionings.
The statements were interpreted by investors as being ready to inject fresh capital on the US markets or even further interest reductions in order to stabilise the credit condition.
The statements also reassured Wall Street, which has recently been seen by several bad news about the US economy, such as a negative record of the number of home sales in the United States.
The adverse effect of financial anxiety has also been confirmed by the announcement by the Bear Stearns Investment Bank that it will release 650 employees and 4% of its global labour force as part of the cost reduction to offset losses in the US second-market mortgage sector.
The above measure affects 20 jobs in London with 1500 employees.
In New York, the average industrial index of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, 2.55 per cent and closed at 13.289.40 points, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 per cent.
The London FTSE Index 100 increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 per cent and closed at 6.306,2 and thus increased the value of British blue chip companies with more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax increased by 2.6 percent while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
The lack of credit market anxiety has recurred after the high demand auction organised by the European Central Bank has taken place at a price of 4.7% of the three-month period papers which have been undetected since April 2001.
Since the interbank interest rate in English, Libor reached the highest level since September 6,59 per cent after the level of growth observed after 12 November, the Bank of England was under greater pressure to follow Fed and the ECB, and to allow additional capital to the money market in London.
In England they demand a decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
He gave me two dilemmas, one is more complicated than the other.
Who's got the 6th field of the British team in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And the first test against Sri Lanka in indirect context is not less important than who will make the decision?
The latter question is present, on the one hand, because David Graveney, the president of the selectors, who is temporarily performing this task, will assist the leading coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan in the decision. On the other hand, the account of the English Executive Director Hugh Morris' bureau will be completed with requests for national or at least one-time selection post.
Of the two players, it draws the shorter, which does not receive the sixth batch place, but as known, life, and especially sport, often unfair.
It's never easy to tell you what makes someone's profession peak, while other people can't get past a lower level, and it's often more fortunate than for talent.
It's not just cricket that it's hard to choose - often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if that happens?
The same question could be raised in other areas of life, for example, when we say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two wise young leaders with excellent qualifications would be placed before the decision-makers, while only one of them has room for one of them.
Who can tell you which level is a cricket player without being thrown into deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, data have a major influence on the decision, but options are equally important.
In a team, the player must catch the captain's look at the cricket gate at the right moment, and a batter must have a regular chance if he wants to become a big player.
It's more complicated to catch the look of the pickers.
For example, more than James Anderson played in the last season, but he still counts as a team member on the first test, despite the fact that Stephen Harmison himself says he's in good shape and he's doing very well.
Anderson fought his participation on the tour with 32 first-class gates and 33 runs.
Chris Tremlett just hit 29, but both of you have already had successful moments at the highest level, and they hope they'll be like this in the future.
Shah or Bopara will play at the Asgiriya Stadium, well, that will be decided on the basis of opinions.
This decision can destroy or break anyone's career, but it may also occur that it will not have a special impact on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankan Gareth Batty played all the tests and performed well with five gates and 40 useful runs, but Paul Collingwood, who was then on the forefront, became a prominent and definitive test cricket, who may even be underestimated today, despite the fact that he had obtained a double hundred points against Australians.
It is likely that their discussions in Asgiriya Stanley today will be taken against the young life force and dynamism of Bopara, following their conservative instincts in Graveney, Vaughan and Moores.
They're both on their side.
She speaks next to Shah, the bright and successful debutation of the 88 bombay test in the quarters, against the younger, 22-year-old Bopara six of her seven years, who, in other words, had an excellent twist thrown, she scored a hundred of 32 first grades.
However, the fact that the Middlesex player, Shah, was home in May, at the test in Lorda, ran only ten quarters against West Indies in two quarters, and that Vaughan, who fought for the re-employment of the next game, was facing the immediate resistance of the selectors, seems to have reduced the stamina that was still clearly visible in Bombay.
In contrast to him, Essex's universal talent is a life-saving and unreasonable player.
There's nothing to be upset about on the cricket track, but he was well characterized by his attitude outside the field, when he crashed at an exhibition with a four-wheel of the team's autosponsor, Volkswagen.
But the first thing he did after that was that he took Vodafone's phone (naturally sponsored) and called his distant teammate, Alastair Cook, to ask him, "Have you seen this?"
Bopara is a better team player with classics. It creates an advantageous drum angle for its struggling medium steps, and its punches are confident and skilled.
Choosing the right person is one thing and another is the right moment.
Maybe it's the real art of choice.
I would personally give Bopara a chance, which doesn't mean I don't think Shah would give you an excellent opportunity if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he would be the one who plays this weekend.
They're transporting the refugees home with buses to work and fight Al-Qaida.
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria to Baghdad with the Iraqi refugees who have lost their money or lost their visas, or actually those who hope that the city has restored order.
There are also men who came back to fight those soldiers who have been struggling them out of their house.
The bus station in Mansour was already filled with refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a 800-person, dozens of bus loaders, government convoy arrived from Damaskus.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Bagdad," said Dr. Sabah al-Qubaisi sunnita.
"I came back today because on TV and in the newspapers I saw what happened in Bagdad and that the city is now safe.
"The Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he added, referring to the Al-Sadr milicist pastor Moqtada, who is currently shutting down his Shiite army.
The 38-year-old skiite teacher, Qassim al Atwani, who lived mainly by sunnants, returned home with two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented the Iraqi to take a job.
The neighbors of Amaraji’s ski called him and rushed his home, saying, with the help of the American teams, he was able to squeeze Al-Qaida from their castle in the western part of the capital.
One of the first members of the Jordan was a tribe leader of Sunnita and Siita, who escaped from a grenade attack from the home in Sleih, North Bagdad, after he began to encourage his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, my friends called and told me that they created an anti-Qaida militia in Sleikh, and they need to support me and my sons.
That's why I came back today," said the 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many have talked about the fact that they have been seduced home by armed civil forces working with the Americans since their involvement in the capital.
However, more people were forced to return from Damascus because of visa and financial problems.
The 51-year-old, three-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai voiced a wide-ranging view among refugees that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian government to reject the visa application for refugees to force their return.
More than two and a half million people are considered to escape the country's death brigades.
"Everything was fine until Al-Maliki visited Syria and did not pressure the government to not issue more visas for Iraqi to move home," said the sunnita pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I escaped."
One of the reasons for the relief of violence is that sunnites have been banned from the ski areas, while the skies have also left the Sunnita alabouts, and the tension has been reduced in many areas.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will rethink the habits that may lead to even further fights.
Small Saarland - Neighbourhood Training
The smallest federal state plays a leading role in professional training, and its higher education is also internationally oriented.
Only in one field of training, the islanders face the same deficiencies as the rest of the country.
"Fifty-five times on the day I explained to an outside of the island that we aren't French" on this selfish slogan's posters from the 50th birthday of the smallest federal state.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the Saarland Education System, which can glorify the fifth place on the basis of the surveys of the German Economic Institute for Cologne (IW).
In this way, higher education institutions are working closely with neighbouring countries, not only because of traditions, but also traditions.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Students can complete their studies with a double and even three degrees so far.
As a result, the proportion of foreign students is high by 15.6%.
However, schools and colleges in the Saarland are also attracted to those who want to learn in the islands - many of them have no secondary schools.
"In the Saarland, the opportunities of professional training are utilised," explains Axel Plynnecke, an educational expert at the German Economic Institute.
Young people acquire training rights at more than a fifth-century vocational school, making the Saarland more than seven percent of the federal average.
The combined options for vocational training and higher education have also been well developed.
Infrastructure for dual studies is located in the second place within Germany, given the population number.
However, despite practice-oriented training and increased interest, the number of graduating engineers has declined by a third in recent years.
The Finnish Ministry of Education in the islands therefore required higher education institutions to enter a marketing battle with the focus of engineering sciences.
"In general schools, we launched a number of reforms after the first Pisa study," reported a spokesman at the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has carried out comparative tests throughout the country.
To start learning early, the last childhood year is free of charge. It is a model that, in the meantime, the rest of the federal state began to copy.
Only future comparative studies will give answers to the performance of the students.
Based on the Pisa survey in 2003, the risk-related learners rate rose from 29 to 20 per cent.
However, the overall performance of the Saarland has not improved to the same extent as the rest of the federal state.
Bajorans count more.
The biggest vengeance of the island countrysides during the Pisa mating is not taken into account the foreign language knowledge - otherwise, beards could be harvested in this area,
since the language of the neighbouring countries in the high schools is a mandatory subject - even if the islanders are not French.
Chavez changes the clocks
In Venezuela, hours are different in the near future than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will turn time meters back half an hour in the Latin American country.
In the meantime, Chávez became a laugh in Spain.
As stated by Venezuela's official paper, under a new law, the clocks will be rotated four and a half hours compared to the grenwich time.
In this way, the South American State will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
The anti-United Chávez, among other things, justified its decision that the United States forced the entire hours-based time zones to the world.
Chavez also announced on Wednesday (locally) the interruption of relations with neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage.
The nationalist on the left said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, neither the Head of State nor the Colombian government will be in contact.
"I cannot do this because of my own dignity," said Chávez, who calls for a constitutional reform on which the people of the oil country must make an opinion on a referendum on Sunday.
The reform would significantly build up its power in the country.
The cause of the debate was Uribe's decision to withdraw mandate from Chávez to negotiate the release of hostages with marxists in Colombia.
Uribe's decision was "fucked" Venezuela, giving a voice to her critics on Sunday of Chávez.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chávez.
In the country, a new cell phone-knock-knock-knocked out: "Por qué no te Callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut), that's how the sentence sounds, which has been filled by over half a million people on the Internet.
The sentence is derived from John Charles, King of Spain, who was so upset by the constant intercourse of the populist politician in Balold, at the last Latin America summit, that he cut into his voice.
In 2007, wage reduction threatens the Germans
According to a projection, real wage reduction is a threat to German workers this year, despite strong conjunctures.
Experts supported their pessimistic forecasts with abundant reasons.
According to the Hans-Brockler Foundation, in 2007 employees can actually account less wages than in the previous year.
"The reason for this is modest wage development, an increase in general turnover taxes and a rapid increase in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn, a member of the Makroökonomic and Conjunct Research Institute, to the "Bild" newspaper Gustav Horn.
Further burdens on unemployment insurance can also be on workers.
In his statement to the newspaper "Neue Osnabruck Zeitung", Mr Peer Steinbrück stated that in the current situation a reduction of the correct and reasonable unemployment insurance to 3.3% at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult situation as to request the alliance for credit or support, quoted by the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD politician.
Tuesday, it became known that the price exploding of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation of 13 years ago.
In an annual comparison, prices increased by a total of 3 per cent.
Venus is the Devil's Twin brother on Earth
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it is more similar to the Earth than it had been assumed to be: In the air, the European Venus Express piano has covered lightnings, and in the corners of the corners, it covers winds like those of the winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists assume that Venusson is lightning.
The European Venus Express has provided evidence - electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings in Venus are spreading from the cloud to the cloud at a height of 56 kilometres, reports Christpher Russell, a colleague of the University of Los Angelesia University of California on the belly of the Nature magazine.
According to the famous "extended soup theory", the development of Earth life has been caused by lightning: According to the theory, the ciders have triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the development of amino acids, the building tubes of life.
Not this way at Venus: "If there was ever a life there, it could have been in very early times," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
At present, there is hardly a living organism on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere on the wheel is 100 times thicker than on Earth, and sometimes temperature values reach 500 degrees.
"Maybe the Venus is the Earth's hell twin brother, but still his twin brother," he drew it to Russell.
The main question of Esa's mission is why Venus is so similar to the Earth in a completely different way of development.
The "Venus Express" start of November 2005 was a milestone in the Venus Research, since since the early nineties there was no Sonde on the way to find this planet.
According to researchers, the latest research results that have already been presented in several "Nature" articles are not just evidence of the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also show that the similarity of the neighbouring planet to the Earth is greater than it was assumed in the first time," said Esa.
In addition to the well-known northern Arctic rolling wind, researchers discovered a much faster cloud of clouds on the South Pole.
The phenomenon reminds us of the air flows of the Winter Hemisphere on Earth, the research team leading Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Istituto di Astrophisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second supreme planet of the solar system is almost the same as that of the Earth, and with its diameter of 12100 kilometres almost the size of the Earth.
The sky body called Esthajnalstar will avoid the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower around its own tent: a venus day lasts 243 ground days.
Although the 460 Celsius-grade surface temperature of Venus 92 bar is hardly resembled to Earth, scientists begin by the fact that both planets were created in a completely similar situation.
Both of them gathered water that remained as an ocean on Earth while the Venus left into the universe.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbon carbonate taps, the Venusson represents a large part of this atmosphere.
To protect Köhler, Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Köhler, the President of the German Republic, demands the conclusion of the dispute between the parties that was exploding around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellary Office.
In a direct way, he cried to the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after the bet in September.
President Horst Köhler of the German Republic is concerned about Germany's authority and called on the Grand Coalition to finish the debate about the Dalai Lama's bet.
"In this matter we should not appear as a divided nation towards the outside world," said Köhler to the Handelsblatt.
Köhler expressed his understanding at the same time that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) welcomed the Dalai Lama in September.
"Mensic rights are universally applicable to me even if I respect the diversity of cultures," Köhler pointed out.
Everyone is aware that Germany needs to take care of the foreign policy sensitive balance, but the President of the Republic stressed that Merkel was defended against the accusation that the Chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor didn't break up with the traditional "a China" policy.
China is aware of that," he pointed out Köhler.
Minister of Foreign Affairs (SPD) Frank-Walter Steinmeier, indirectly, gave a voice of non-reporting the Dalai Lama's betting and became a target for attacks in the EU.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's 'policy policy' in the field of foreign policy.
Following the reception of Dalai Lama in the Chancellary Office, there were severe disturbances in the German-China relations.
Thus, the Chinese leadership did not just return the invitation of the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but, according to SPIEGEL, it also freezed the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the Foreign Ministry of the two countries.
The Chinese Head of State of Wen Jiabao has now called on the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China rejects the official acceptance by European politicians of the religious leader of the Tibetans, the Chinese position was confirmed by Wen Jiabao.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama pointed out that he was trying to dismantle other Tibetan territories, including other countries today.
Schuble Protects from Disturbations Like France
Street conflicts with the police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schauble protects from confusions similar to those in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not lead to street violence, demands the Federal Minister of Interior.
Barricades were burning, randomists shot with a beer rifle on the police: after the serious disruption of young people in France, Wolfgang Schauble is concerned with similar developments in Germany.
"We need to make sure that social explosives don't accumulate in our house, and don't incite violence.
We need to take this seriously," she said to the newsletter "Neue Presse" in Hanover.
Not all young people are adapted to rapid changes in social reality.
Alliance, provinces and communities are currently working intensively to solve problems, said Schuble.
This does not only concern the integration of immigrants.
"from the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes have been shown."
However, it is too early to resolve the emergency.
At the same time, Schuble pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German precincts such as France.
During the last night in the northern towns of Paris, young people fought heavy street fights with the police.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
In view of all this, Kenan Kolat, Head of the Turkish Communities in Germany, demanded a greater degree of integration activity from the federal government.
With regard to the troubles in France, Kolat warned me about the "risk of a follow-up".
Although the situation in Germany is not as fragile as in France,
However, action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families is "higher than average".
There should be more educational places to be provided in front of all things.
Kolat emphasised: "We must give young people perspective."
However, the leader of the Turkish Community added that "social supervision within the family" is more present in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigrant families would not want to destroy what their parents built up here.
Kolat warns us, "We need to be safe despite this."
For young people, "as soon as possible the opportunity to have a job and to receive education" is needed.
Meanwhile, in the outskirts of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel had full rest during the night.
Hundreds of police officers were ready to take off, and a helicopter had a headlight on the ground.
The competent authorities reported three arrests and some flames and cars.
Since the report, a security unit of 1,000 people has taken care of the rest.
The police are ready to intervene as long as it is necessary, reported by Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie of Interior after his visit to the city.
During the Tuesday night, 80 police officers were wounded as a result of the Villiers-le-bel disruptions.
The next night, the troubles spread to Toulouse.
The revolts occurred in a traffic accident during which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the Public Prosecutor, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
Cloud Ride in Angela's Empire
The quest of the Chancellor's reality is the proof that the coalition will end - and nothing is expected from it.
Which country does the Federal Chancellor actually live?
After his general debate in the Bundestag's general debate on its content, it has to be determined that he does not live here - not in the country whose governance would be his business.
He rejected the accusation by Angela Merkel to focus too much on foreign policy.
It's province, responded, and in this way, it's just that he doesn't want to understand what the critics are talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, it made it clear to everyone how utterly utterly utter.
In the meantime, neither specific interest nor empathy was felt about the problems of the country.
Instead, Cloud's Angela appeared: a struggling politician who escapes to foreign policy and is only insecure.
The example of climate protection is: Heiligendammi has unrestly praised its decisions, but he listens to how the climatisation goals should be achieved in the country.
With regard to the self-preservation, this level of modestness would not have been afforded by the President of the CDU two years earlier.
Now he's getting into the frustration that prosperity is causing a positive effect on people.
This harms the good news he acquired as a pragmatic personality, which, instead of speaking flowers, provides a solution to problems.
However, in the Imperial Empire of the Cloudman Angela, internal policy problems are only related.
Children's poverty and the problems of low-income people?
It's just a few half words.
In this regard, it is a lot to say how often you are stumbled when it comes to a family replacement.
It's three times what Merkel's got to do to get a half-sized-foot sentence together.
If it's specific, it's in a foreign area.

During the debate of the Republican presidential candidates on Youtube, the two fans, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, have had a tough change and must be kept from an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already surfaced on the first topic.
Mitt Romney says to his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, that he made New York a "rescue of illegal immigrants".
He who controversises with serious facts on his own side, "I would say that his own house served as a refuge for illegal immigrants," he cuts Giuliani back and throws it into the eyes of the former governor of Massachusetts that he was working as a private person with no documents.
The candidates are attacking: Since the Republican camp still has no uniformly supported favorite, eight presidential warriors are using the CNN debate before all to underscore their counterpart's credit.
Online users have sent their own videos of 30 seconds via Youtube just less than short summaries.
"We have brought Hitler to power with this type of isolacionism," he tries to John McCain's opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one who demands the immediate exit from Iraq.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washed into Vietnam's veteran when he is reluctant to condemn the so-called Waterboarding as torture, the interrogation method in which he simulates the flooding.
The fact that the campaign's important topics are only overlooking Iraq and the debate on torture, shows the reaction of the public in St. Petersburg in Florida.
There is a loud applause in the room when the conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
In the meantime, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more visible.
"I was wrong," he regretfully declares Romney and apologizes in front of the supporters and the television viewers for the fact that he took his vex in 1994 in case of abortion.
Giulian, however, pours when he is asked for a literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first governs as a civilian
One day after the military retreat, it took place as President of Musharraf practising power in Pakistan.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, fell over another five-year term of office on Thursday.
The Pakistani television broadcasts the ceremony live from the capital, the presidential palace of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to the Constitution and to act for his people.
On Wednesday, he handed his military leadership office to Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus allowed international pressure from the United States to go ahead.
Earnest General now, eight years after he broke power in the form of a military bucket without a bloodshed, he is first governed as a civilian head of state.
Musharraf's retreat as the chief commander of the armed forces has fulfilled a fundamental demand from the West and the opposition.
Another important claim is the abolition of the exceptional state, which was announced by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Advocate General Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will cease the extraordinary state with which he meets a further demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, in which Musharraf, after the publication of the exceptional status, had embedded sympathizers in early November, has rejected every protest last week in relation to the re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal area, North Vaziristan, as a result of an attack on a military convoy, and four others were injured.
According to the information provided by the military spokesman, the bomb was exploded on a road near the border of Afghanistan.
The fathers of Klautrock return
The seventy-year German super team replays: The three band members of Harmonia have reposhed their instruments to the strength of a concert in Berlin.
On the occasion of the reconstruction, one of their light age, "Live 1974" shows a cut record.
They were better known abroad at that time.
The notified sensation was killed in the presence of three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
Before each, his own instrument, his own cable, and above all his own buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in the middle of your 63 years in snow white shirt.
Michael Rother, who is a young person in his 57 years, provides an escort in possession of a laptop and guitar.
From the right side of the audience, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius rolls and focuses on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, and once or twice a rhythm.
And all of this sometimes comes together into traditional music by accident.
However, all of this seems not to disturb the masters.
It was a great enthusiasm for the fans of the Klautrock music direction that the Harmony band was playing again.
What we can tell you here: As a result of proper post-posting, we can conclude that the name has collapsed through the collective pope, but in no case has left any lasting marks that are painfully missing this band after 32 years.
But why shouldn't I celebrate the legends of the 70s of the Germans?
Especially because what we call misleadingly Krautrock has always been appreciated more in England and America than in our own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Lifework to the members of the Cologne Can band in 2003, the German pop figures sat in the room with an incomprehensible face.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers gave thanks to the La Düsseldorf and Neu! bands, the admiration became unlimited.
At the concerts, Michael Rother was sitting as an old friend with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage.
Two sides of the same coin of domestic rejection and foreign acceptance.
The memory is overloaded by Harmony, because the trio existed for only two years, and in time it had a far lower effect than others in the past attributed to him.
Moebius and Roedelius have already played with Conrad Schnitzler under the promising Cluster.
At first, they played in the basement under the theatre in Schabühne, Berlin.
Then, in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, a record company funded by the Church.
Rother helped the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and parallel to that, the most radical German band, the Neu!, has acquired a reputation for himself as a guitar.
In 1973, however, Rother followed Clooster’s musicians to their exile in Weserbergland Forst.
There, at the Alter Weserhof, they lived in a 16th - century Ram as a communist escaped from the city.
Less ideologically than in Communicate I, where Roedelius was still a babysitter.
Their lives are more of an idyllian artist.
According to the garbage, the valley of Harmonia Ottenstein’s songwriter was found in this way as their art.
Some of these things were recorded by Harmony.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next one is "De Luxe".
Despite his loose and modest music, the band suffered financial needs.
The carpet collection alone didn't guarantee you to find yourself.
The CD on "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert held in Griessem, in front of an audience with a record number of fewer than 50 people, so someone remembers.
Harmony's excitement and occasional exercise at that time was Rother's idea.
This is an immortal claim for Roedelius and Moebius.
The band announced the division in 1975.
Rother was at the esoterics and kept herself from albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster was relived in the '80s, which has been more successful since then than Harmonia has ever been.
Thanks to Herbert Grönmeyer, the live album of griesem.
His record company, who listened to Grönland, set out its goal to care for the Krautrock as a special German additive in live music.
In this context, Neu! has been extracted as well as the solo creation of Roedelius.
The resurrection of Harmonia will be held in the house of the Berlin Cultures.
Public money within the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of our British ancestor and the handbook "Krautrock Sampler" is also present.
There's also Loveparade's master of ideas, Dr. Motte.
All of this is about circulating the impact of the Krautrock on the next pop musician era.
In this respect, Harmonia fills out the empty space reserved for the supergroup.
Brian Eno's finding with the most unusual sounds in the room, "The only true music is his future."
There are pictures of the producer with Harmony in the room of a farmhouse.
Other black and white photographs of cable-cabled equipment are designed for legendary construction.
In the front field, the three veterans are reservoirs with improvisation.
This only means that microphones are recorded for the organs and drum equipment with the intention of exposing sound effects from the instruments itself by means of sound effects which have not yet been heard.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three deep-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-thre
Even the circular doesn't change anything about this.
Under Barbara Morningstern's leadership, they cough and puzzle, and they sing "Aaaaaaaah!" with a lovely part of them insinuating "Aaaaaaaah!"
Klautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about the rock.
The roots were searched less in blues than in musical schools (Can), technical knowledge (Kraftwerk) or in excursions to artistic and social conventions (Clester).
If anyone here yells "68!" he doesn't go all the wrong way, and Harmony doesn't even let himself get out of peace.
Even the most understandable thing on the stage is thoroughly considered.
Where does music begin, and where does it end?
This can nervously make you mad or give you a gift with the moments of exceptional happiness.
Richard Gere isn't cynical enough.
Two films deal with the Balkan war again through "Fighting" and "Mörderisher Frieden".
But none of them are convincing.
The basic idea, or too much for action and shooting, is too emotional.
Even Richard Gere himself can't help in "Fighting."
First of all, the good news: Although the two war criminals, Karadsiks and Mladics are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, there, in the dark back of the Bosnian war, Richard Gere was found again.
We have recently lost sight of the most beautiful man in the eighties, since the role of many good boys in emotional films for women and the many press conferences on the topic of Buddhism even took our pleasure to look at it.
And here, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most profound argument in addition to perhaps we're looking at the "Filming" movie.
It provides a wonderful, smiling design: Simon Hunt, basically, is what Gere could have become when fate and the film industry weren't so gracious: a man who left his most beautiful years long behind, but his decay was still keeping a significant part of his former attraction in the ruinous monuments.
However, the "Filming" film and also the production of "Mörderischer Frieden" that started this week continues only the endless series of lost films on the Balkan war.
We don't have to waste much on the "Mörderisher Frieden" movie: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemel), who will save a Serbian woman from the Kosovo snipers, and one of them suddenly loves it as an add.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not once described as the only cause of all bad things, the film bearing the smuggling of TV films is too quickly lost in the shooting and event scenes.
"Cobra 11" means a war instead of a highway.
On the other hand, it is exemplary to consider why none of the really good movies about the Balkan war have actually been made.
The story of the three US military scientists, who are rising up to look up the Serbian war criminal who listened to the name "Root" with other directors, other scenario writers (the two of Richard Shepard's personal unions) in another age might have become a new "Apocalypse now".
For the stories show a surprising similarity: In both cases, small groups cut him into the woods to do what the army is unable to do, and then, in both cases, the trip to madness is rounded up.
One of the reasons for the failure of "Fighting" is that he simply won't let Simon Hunt be the cynical one who listens to his heart, as he first shows him.
No, and in the scenario, he even spent a romantic relationship with a woman who was later murdered by Muslim boshes.
The "Fighting" is going to slip forever when the reporters reach what all head hunters of the NATO, the CIA and the world were unable in five years: they'll take the war sinner and give him to the mohammedian bosns for fair revenge.
It's so bad that a person is most willing to turn to the Hague International Tribunal for the crime against his cinema's logic.
But the purpose of the film is deeply human.
He intends to put Karadsjis and Mladics on the ground and suspects the Americans and the French (they are supposed to be exceptionally united) that they do not pursue intensively enough persecution due to secret political deals.
But good and evil sometimes look so much like each other, that a man thinks of a famous Brecht poem.
In this poet says about the Asian demon on the describing describing: "I am staring at an asiatic demon, in the first place, the plumbing shaft, which tells me how exhausting it is to be."
Films like "Fighting" have masks of the same sized human head shape that show how exhausting it is to be.
This problem is not only limited to the artwork of the Balkan war movies.
Recently, there was a report in the newspaper that all the films about Iraq in Hollywood were ugly.
We can add: There has not yet been any good movies about South Africa.
It's almost always valid: If a star runs in the world's crises or minefields, it's like "The Ways of Freedom" with Patricia Arquette, with Angelina Jolie, or Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close to time.
They had to go for decades while Hollywood was able to shoot a good movie from the holocaust with Scandler's list.
Some films are probably still coming - because today's classical works about the Vietnam War, such as "The Horse hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated as a masterpiece in their time.
But nowadays, when all mass murders arrive in real time, right through two screens, we can imagine simply too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs scenario writers of ignoring reality that is necessary to tell the good stories.
I mean, "France or not to be" or "The dictator" finally got so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't go for the good if you're trying to make a good movie.
Maybe we need to put the novel writer Lawrence Norfolk in a sarcastically distant manner of artistic vision.
When his historical novel "Lemprière lexikon" and his parallels between the Balkan war, he said, "This only depends on the fact that certain things never change.
Big cities will always be awfully dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust is highly criticized for the olympiad's resignation.
The absconding of the mayor, from his offer to organize the Summer Olympic Games in Hamburg, has triggered intense criticism in political and economic life.
A lot of people want to keep fighting for the arrangement of water games.
However, Von Beust is highly alert to realities during his probation.
On Wednesday, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, he considered the withdrawal as 'incontributable to the economic environment'.
No other project has recently released such powerful motivation forces in the city than the Olympic idea.
Without this goal, we can't maintain a level playing field in sport policy."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative that starts from modified time coordinates.
Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his previous statements that the ambitions of Hamburg for the Olympic Games are not real until 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Association," said Von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
The Sports Association’s decision to tender for the winter Olympic Games in 2018 was expected at the beginning of December.
"The preference for this means that we will not have real opportunities within the 2028 period that we have thought so far."
However, we do not give up the dream forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sport Association (HSB) expressed its regrets over the statements by Von Beus.
This impresses me that Hamburg will not apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to burst a chance to bury our plans now," said Günter Plutz, president of the HSB on Wednesday.
In addition, the resignation from the application is contrary to the statement by the President of the Senate which was made at the General German University Sports Association meeting.
There, the offer submitted to the City of Beust Hamburg in 2015 was described as not a substitute for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The College Sports Association has only started Hamburg as a projected city last week.
The civil group of the SPD raised the Senate that it had left valuable time unused for building housing in Hamburg.
"Kleiner Grasbrook has been delaying the development of the Senate for years since he was standing next to the Olympics and ignored the building of the apartment," said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued to focus on the integrated plan for Kleiner Grasbrook in the Olympics and subsequent housing, the CDU unilaterally placed the emphasis on the "foreign factor".
At the time of the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, the offer was very enthusiastic in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg Lipcsen fell.
These aren't Warhol's crates.
Whoever connects the concepts of Sweden and the village with each other is thinking of Ikea and not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
The wallades currently manufactured in Sweden put dark shadows on the list of Warhol's satellites.
The ninety-four listed in this "Stockholm-type" Brillo Box is mostly forgery.
A few months ago, after the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" doubted the originality of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes, now the internal investigation of Stockholm Moderna Music came into question: Pontus Hultén, former director of Museum, has contributed to Moderno Museet by six copies of "Brillo Box" and most likely a hundred more "Stockholm" Brillo Box on the international art market.
The history is a long and complicated chain of artistic and confusional stunts.
In 1964 Warhol created the first "Brillo Boxes" in New York - painted wallades based on red-blue-white formats of "Brillo" soap powder.
Hundreds of Brillo boxes, made of papers, were produced at a exhibition held in Moderna Museet 1968, with the consent of Warhol: they were not from Warhol (for cost savings reasons) but were transported directly from the Brillo carton factory.
It wasn't about artwork, it was about their templates, their simple exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission to produce some Brillo panels in Sweden in 1968, which were not established in Moderna Museet.
The Witnesses of the age are now talking about fifteen boxes that were then certified as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the title "Stockholm-type" in the art and auction history.
Some of them were auctioned for over $10,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director, made false claims that in 1968 hundred wallads were manufactured and established in Sweden, which he then left Warhol.
In fact, the 105 boxes of Hultén were manufactured in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in Pétervár.
But at that time Warhol was dead three years ago.
Lars Byström, the main architect of Moderna Museet, has also examined three Swedish private boxes in addition to six Brillo Box in the museum, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The sprayed sheets were first lashed and crocheted, and the white oil paint was then removed.
In contrast, the structure of the copies from 1990 tells us that the paint was put directly on the spray sheet with a painter, without foundation, and it is not oil, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not certified by the artist, so they should be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Music: "If the "Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board" in New York decides otherwise, the Moderna Music will be classified as a copy/exhibition material."
Of course, the Authentication Board has already announced in June that he will investigate "serious accusations" in the case of soap powder boxes.
But since then, they've been in unquestionable silence.
Manila Rebel Soldiers Give Up
The rebel was surrendered in the Philippines by the soldiers who barigated themselves in a hotel in Manila and called for the failure of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, told the reporters their hotel manager Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud.
Before that, the hotel was collisioned by steering soldiers of tear gas.
The two dozens of soldiers have barricadeed themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team was before the court on Thursday, due to the 2003 puppy experiment, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly solve a wheel with 30 sympathizers.
The military police responsible for the man's guard obviously moved to him and joined the music.
They entered the Peninsula-Hotel and then called for the failure of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
steering units have closed the area of the exquisite hotel.
The president asked the security office for an extraordinary meeting.
Norberto Gonzales Security Advisor convicted the military process.
"They have enough for people," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, formerly commander of the Scout Rangers Election, declared that other units of the Army wanted to join the journey within a short time.
The judges of the government called for a strong protest against the President on Friday.
Your government has been shadowed by corruption accusations for several months.
Manila's financial district was already the main colour in 2003 of its attempt to protest against Arroyo, organised by 200 military members.
The uprising faded in the past of 24 hours when the army turned to join.
