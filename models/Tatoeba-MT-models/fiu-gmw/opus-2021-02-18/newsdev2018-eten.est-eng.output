Two powerful women share the secrets of their success
What does Barbara Corcoran and Laila Al have in common?
In the first place, these women come from two completely different worlds.
The New York real estate magnet Barbara Corcoran was able to convert a thousand-dollar loan into a five-miljard-worthy real estate company before using his expertise on the television screen, participating in the ABC real life series "Shark Tank" investors' panel.
Laila Ali has been following her father's footsteps, becoming the four-fold invincible champion of the most successful female fighter before the roles of the TV director, author and speaker were added to her resymble.
In spite of their unique career paths (or perhaps because of them), TJ Maxx recruited both women to help them to discuss the break-in of stereotypes and the achievement of high-speed goals for the halls.
Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in shops across the country and discovered that 80 percent of them feel that society has set them a stereotypically solid role and expectations.
As a result, they came out with the Maxx You Project to help women break these barriers.
Corcoron and Ali know a lot about it, but they may have been at the top of their field, but the journey was not smooth for each of them.
Corcoran scored D in high school and college mainly and had already worked 20 jobs when he was 23 years old.
Ali entered one of the most man-centred fields and, in addition, stood in her way by a trial to try to step out of the shadow of her father, who was a superstitious icon.
These two softly say, pack through the knowledge acquired by the difficulties.
That is why we sat down with these powerful women to talk about failures, success and confidence in business and relations.
What inspires you to do what you do every day?
Laila Ali: I'm inspired by my personal goals every day.
I have developed a habit of writing things I want to achieve.
And I'll look at this list.
I think I'm responsible.
Of course, my children inspire me.
My ambitions inspire me.
I wish I could be victorious in everything I'm doing in my life.
I understand that the achievement of my objectives requires hard work, but I am ready to do so.
My confidence comes from preparation.
So I spend a lot of time preparing.
Barbara Corcoran: Like Laila, the key to my confidence is too much preparation, but I don't get my inspiration from it.
Actually, I'm inspired by the curiosity of the truth.
What happens if I do it?
What will be without me if I don't?
That curiosity makes me get out of bed in the morning because I can't wait to see what the day brings.
If I don't feel like this someday, I'm just pretending to feel them.
Then I'm going to believe myself, and I'm getting inspiration again.
Tell us about some obstacles in your career, which have made you much better in the long term.
Barbara Corcoran: For me, the hardest thing was when my girlfriend left me and married my secretary.
I finished business a year later, but this year in my life - being a fifth bike - was terrible because I didn't have the confidence to leave.
I felt subdued, no inspiration.
But amazing things happen.
The hardest thing to believe is when you're hit.
The year that I spent was extremely difficult to run myself and start the business again from zero to zero - this time without a partner.
Laila Ali: I would say that the hardest time in my career was when I was playing boxing, I was at the top of my career and decided to break up.
I didn't just divorce my husband, but I also separated from the manager and the person who taught me everything I know about boxing.
I didn't think I could make it without him.
So I began to worry about the future of my career and I had to find a time to step back and say to myself, "You have all the knowledge and experience you need.
You have all these experiences in boxing.
You can definitely do that."
So I formed a new team around me and continued my career.
In fact, it was simply necessary to achieve the right spirit, as all the rest was driven from there.
I did what I had to do, I had to face fear and find the courage to get rid of my husband and manager and continue my career, and everything settled.
When did you feel that you really made progress?
Laila Ali: I felt that I was successful when I won my first championship title.
It was a really good feeling, because when I started boxing, I wanted to be one of the best, to be invincible.
I was able to achieve this goal, and I didn't win the title of the championships one time but four times.
Barbara Corcoran: One moment when I felt that I was successful, I was in the 11th year of my activity.
I had finally gained.
I had earned a profit of about $42,000 that I couldn't expect.
I went out right now and bought a new car for both my mom and dad, and they had never had a new car, and I let the cars go to Florida, where they kept their retirement.
I felt like the Queen of England.
I felt so cool.
I served much more in the coming years, but nothing has yet been able to offer an emotion like the opportunity to give back something to my parents and surprise them.
How could you keep yourself motivated for this 11-year-old period to continue working?
Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business by profit because it wasn't my goal.
I just wanted to see how far I could get.
On the first day of my life, I've made a dream to become the New York Real Estate King.
And I saw myself as a pope in the eyes of my mind, everybody kisses my ring, and they worship me.
I had such a small thought in my head.
So, when I kept trying every day, every hour, I didn't really think about making money.
Finally, I accidentally earned my money.
But all the money that came in I sent back to business right away.
I don't even think I had any depressing days where I would have thought that oh God, we don't make money.
I was just convinced that something would work.
The worst that could have happened would have been losing the company and becoming a waitress again.
So I'd make a good tip and I was happy.
I could be happy again.
That is why I do not believe that the great effort of many who have made success is money.
They have other motives that encourage them.
And the money wasn't one of mine.
Do you have any advice to anyone who has such great dreams, but who is held back by a financial factor?
Barbara Corcoran: When I began to earn a lot of money, I had money to invest in real estate, but I had no time.
I built a company.
And that's why I found five different partners that weren't even professionals in the makelaar business, but in different neighbourhoods of all towns who knew their streets through and out.
I approached them and said, "You know this neighborhood.
Find me the best building.
I'll give you the money and you'll be my partner. "
The lesson here is that if you have money, you need people to make money with your money.
And if you have talent, you can sell it to someone who has money and make money with it.
Here are two aspects: talent and money.
But if we're not both together, nothing's gonna happen very big.
Finally, I - and my partners too - have been very well together in all these years with those great investors I would never have had if I hadn't had the courage to find those who love to step.
You can always get money if you believe you have talent and know your part of the world better than anyone else.
What are the two or three things you do every morning that will help you succeed?
Laila Ali: I don't know about you, but I have a lot of moments in my life when I feel overburdend, being a mother, a businesswoman, a husband... all the roles we play as women.
I got to a point in my life where I really had to set up a routine in the morning.
I like to get up and just feel grateful.
Thankful for the resurrection, for your health, for your children, for your family.
I often write down every night, which is my goals for the next day, and when I wake up, I look at this list again.
Meditation.
Sometimes I write in a diary.
I always drink a cup of coffee.
And I always do first thing in the morning, because if I don't do it, it's not gonna happen.
For me, it is ultimately a matter of priorities.
These are things that are important to me: my spirituality, focusing on the universe and God, then training and putting my health first.
Because of this, everything else seems simple.
I feel like I can conquer all the challenges I face in the day.
Barbara Corcoran: I'm setting priorities.
I'm working on a list of my duties, which is endless and ridiculous.
And I'll set up what's most important.
What are real priorities?
I am trying to accept the achievement of these most important things.
What do you do to put yourself in the right mood for a big meeting?
Barbara Corcoran: I imagine I'm failing.
It's as weird as it is.
I mean, my God, I'm failing.
I'm scaring myself, and that makes me more effort.
I imagine anyone who competes with me - I'm very striving of nature because I'm one of the ten children and we never got enough of our parents' attention.
I could be very competitive.
And I'll always be here too thoroughly prepared.
Too much preparation will strengthen my confidence.
Laila Ali: Amazing how contradictory we are in this regard.
We are two successful people, and this shows how different things work for different people.
I like to imagine I'm a success.
I like to think about the end, which is success.
I imagine it in my mind, I see it actually happens.
I see a fight ring, a fight, myself as a winner of the belt and a return to the dressing room, celebrating the victory with a piece of cake, as I've always done.
The same applies to meetings.
However, I always prepare myself thoroughly, and this confidence is due to preparation, because there's fear in my head that I'm not doing well or I'm not saying the right things or not the information I need.
That's where I'm getting ready for the game.
But I always enter the end result by visualizing.
You've both been very successful in your career.
How are you going to pass it on?
Laila Ali: I'm very excited that I can be part of the T.J. Maxx project Maxx You Project because I feel this is a chance to do good.
A lot of women need inspiration, encouragement to pursue their dreams and goals.
There's a champion in us all.
In fact, it is about having thoughts and the tools that you need, surrounding yourself with the right people, people who have been able to achieve the things that you are trying to achieve.
Barbara Corcoran: One thing I think I do very well is inspiring people.
That is why I was very excited when I was asked to cooperate with Maxx You Project.
I'm trying to light up the flame of individuality and inspiration that we see here in the faces of all these people, and give them practical advice on how to move on.
Many people start with their dreams, but they tend to get lost at some point.
So we try to help them focus on the purpose.
Everything we teach is practical.
Business planning, even as simple as an elevator call, everything you need to set up a company.
What advice would you give to women who want to succeed in men-centred areas?
Laila Ali: I'm doing one of the most man-centred fields, which is boxing.
To come after my father, who was a global icon and the best of all time, was quite depressing.
For me, the core of the matter was actually finding its talents, courage, strength in itself.
The first thing I had to do was believe in myself that I was able to fight and be successful.
At that point, no one else was involved except me and there were no restrictions on my way except those I had put in my own head.
If you believe in yourself and find your passion, no one can stop you.
Barbara Corcoran: The journey between finding inspiration and having a attitude like me -- "New York Real Estate King" -- and crossing the finish line is hugely long.
And in this intermediary phase, which is every day in your career, a lot of talent is needed.
In order to need these gifts, there is no need for real estate make-up.
I am sure that in Laila's field, it was also necessary to decide what the right people, the right managers, when to start, when to finish, how much money you have, what you can put in, what not, how hard you are willing to do.
These are all subjective decisions.
I'm trying to make these efforts a little more supportive so that these women really feel, "Okay, I get it now.
Let me try.
Here are my three priorities."
If they leave with three main priorities to make things really work, I'm going to bed tonight, smiling at home.
What's on your closet right now?
Laila Ali: Too much cola.
Journals, books, little angel of prayer, my diary.
Probably a bottle of water.
Barbara Corcoran: My nightclub has a small green wake-up bell because I tried to break the habit every morning to look at the phone as the first thing in the morning.
That's why I got it.
That was sweet.
But it never worked.
And still standing there.
And my phone's still on my closet.
What book are you reading now?
Barbara Corcoran: The eighth or the ninth time of "How to win friends and influence people".
It keeps me on the right road.
I think it's still the best book written in this field, no matter what your dreams are, dreams can't be achieved without other people.
And it is possible to interact with it today exactly as it was in the past.
I like reading it from time to time.
This will help me get back to the right path.
Laila Ali: I'm studying at a diet school, which is why I read the book "Nestly Diet".
It's about eating cereals and how they affect our body.
I'm very interested in that.
What is your best advice to deal with success and failures?
Barbara Corcoran: Ignore pessimism.
They are encountered in all kinds of shapes.
You have to remove them from the vocabulary of your brain.
Stay away from the scumbags.
They're sucking you out of energy.
I think I'm like thieves.
They'll come in at night, grab your wallet and leave.
Pessimists destroy teams in any team situation faster than you can blink, because people who feel sorry for themselves want others to feel bad.
They're pulling good people into the hole with them.
I can perfectly avoid all negative people within a 50-km radius of myself, because my goal is to be positive and to take everything I can to take out of life, and to give up everything I have to offer.
So why would I want to spend a minute on such people?
Laila Ali: It must be consistent.
We'll start with many times convinced that we'll take this track now.
Let's do it, let's do it.
But people don't follow it long enough.
Sometimes they give up just before they reach the last hill.
So I think we need to stay on course.
If you feel passionate about something, believe in something, you have to be consistent.
And you have to do the hard work that success requires.
Barbara Corcoran: To ensure consistency, you have to work hard.
Do you know what it takes?
Finishing things.
If you start something, you stop it.
Many are good starters, but not very good graduates.
In Latvia, the most non-burgers live in Daugavpils, Riga and Liepaja.
In Riga there are 125 344 people without Latvian citizenship, 14 266 in Daugavpils and 11 909 in Liepāja.
Outside large birds, Latvian citizens live most in Jekabpils (2347) and Valmiera (1235).
At the beginning of 2017, 242 560 people, who did not have Latvian citizenship, lived in Latvia.
In 2007, there were 392 816 people without Latvian nationality.
Jürgen Ligi recently referred to Facebook as "Actate is a bad reason".
That is why I will not look back and try not to recall what has been done in history and what results have been achieved in order to transform human nature.
I do not assess whether these tests can be considered successful or failed.
I also avoid excessive source references, although I rely on the idea of my most important teacher, Thomas Paul: all my thoughts have been borrowed from somewhere if he only remembered where exactly.
The most remarkable attack in Estonia today is the regeneration of the citizens of the Republic of Estonia - the perfect man.
We don't raise her as we raise a child, in good faith, that she's gonna be a human.
We will raise him as the ruler class imagines it to itself - which one person must be to live in Estonia and speak publicly.
The censor is perfect.
Although the local governing class changed partly a year ago, some educational methods are as scary as those of the previous ruling class, now poored adorned, and their cruelty is no less than the previous ones.
They're just different.
Latvian beer is a brand of the new era's fine-tuning beer.
0.5 promillion compulsory to heads of state
The governing class includes not only those politicians who get paid from the state for their work, but also those self-conscious people who do politics voluntaryly (read: intentionally): write Mihkel Muti's design using opinion flags, racing on Facebook, how terrible people live around them in the obscured Estonia, picturing, bocoting, junking, sabotating them.
They agree to stay only in the Echo Chamber (English expression of people living in a room with only suitable opinions for them, such as their own Facebook friends, etc.), but this is not possible in conflicted Estonia.
Still, there is a companion who thinks or does something that is unacceptable to the people of the echo house.
And there's the war open, and the vigilante cannons mess up.
We have a lot of politicians who know exactly how much people can drink, sleep with, how many children breed, how to work, get a lot of pay, when to rest, think about what to eat, how to enjoy, when to be sick, how to die.
In very important places.
If their public speeches are rejected by anything other than what they said themselves, they are angry, insulted, hysteria.
The fact that people in a number of European countries "full of their heads" drive a car, and this is legally permissible does not divert their opinions.
The zero tolerance is the only tolerance allowed in all areas, but behind the zero tolerance is not care, but dam.
Class hate and racism - only people like me can do it.
Holy politicians can only open their mouths, but never open their hearts.
They believe that every "action" that they make better society works, and it is worth trying.
Fortunately, we have the cliques under the glorious attention of an adequate scale of card force, the crucifixes with a spiritual defect, jumping through every window - pain.
That is why it seems to us if some smart farmer opens his mouth and he is being beaten emotionally in the mansion for it, that is reasonable.
Some words that certainly send us to the mansion hall are gay, refugee, woman, violence, and so forth.
If you believe everything that selfish officials, activists and politicians (these are only a small part of all groups, but they are able to strangle so that the entire society is mourning) talk and write, the citizen is not only disgusting, filthy and unpleasant, but also brainless, without brains.
But let us not believe, do not provoke to tolerate, do not forbid to drink.
In any case, the Estonian person drinks as much as he wants, not as much as the country allows.
In any case, the Estonian person accepts more than he is forced to be tolerated.
Estonian people do not change their behaviour two months before the elections to turn their backs on their popularity diet, and not only in their mouths, but also to push out what is quickly restored to unpleasant cerebral fats.
Whoever does otherwise is not the right Estonian.
I don't think any people can be rebuilt.
I believe that you can teach a person.
To drink wisely, to love your family, to be a hardworker, polite, attractive companion, not only for friends but for society as a whole.
To teach you, you don't have to be fine, limited, banned, forced, invited, put in a corner, throwing dirt eggs in a media mess.
The teacher must be an example.
A smoker politician talks about the harm of tobacco?
A police officer who's crossing the speed at the free time's gonna make me fine for crossing the speed?
And then he gets caught up by a colleague with his head...
I have such a clumsy idea that maybe we should try to re-establish the dominant class.
Tell them not to drink secretly.
If you drink, drink in the public: at the place of the Rae House, in the eyes of all the people.
Pushing the speed only in the public - the rulers' cars, including private cars, be it all red.
If you rule, rule as you rule yourselves.
Maybe shame will be enough if words and actions don't work together.
Or we'll know that we want the hardest to rule us.
Because all of us, Estonians, are the kind we don't want to be.
Where to escape from yourself?
The leaking of Trump's trump's trump's trump's transcripts, according to former prosecutors, is probably a federal crime.
The one who leaked the transcripts of phone calls between President Trump and foreign leaders to the press was likely to commit a crime on Thursday, claimed by former prosecutors when the legislators called to identify the defendant.
"The unauthorised disclosure of these documents to the press is a crime," said former District Prosecutor Joe diGenova Fox News.
These different acts, including the disclosure of notes of discussions between the President and foreign leaders and their transcripts, are a serious threat to national security.
On the basis of the documents leaked, The Washington Post announced new details of Trump’s tense speeches at the end of January with President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull.
In the first, Trump told the Mexican Head of State to stop public declarations that his government would not pay for the border wall.
According to the newspaper, the transcripts contained notes suggesting that they have been classified by the Head of the National Security Council.
The Post said that they had received complete transcripts, "the staff of the White House" based on the records of the White House notes.
"There is a federal law provision that makes such classified information unauthorized for leaking a crime, a federal crime," said the former New York State Attorney General Doug Burns on the phone interview.
Although some of the individual things in these calls came to the public already in February, the disclosure of transcripts points to the White House, who seeks to reduce leaks.
The report was published randomly at a time when the management figures of Trump’s administration were preparing to take a strong stand in the public on Friday to show their commitment to the eradicating of classified information leakers.
Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions, State Intelligence Director Dan Coats, Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein and Head of National Intelligence and Security Centre William Evanina is expected to take a course to the public at the Department of Justice.
It's not clear if the Ministry of Justice is investigating The Post's leak.
In order to be charged for this, Burns says, "sure elements must be clearly proven."
He said that "somethings may occur on this subject," referring to the investigation and decision of former State Secretary Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
These considerations include the labelling and history of the document and its precise classification.
In the event of secrecy, prosecutors will examine whether the document was leaked to an unauthorised person in a way that has a negative impact on the interests of the United States.
"If all this is proven, people can undoubtedly be in a criminally defenseless situation," said Burns.
"No doubt."
Speaking of Trump's phone calls transscripts, diGenova, a public prosecutor in spionage cases, said that such documents are "usually classified as a secret and higher".
In claiming that these leaks would jeopardise the ability of the United States Government to pursue foreign policy, DiGenova's Prime Prosecutor called to convene a federal jury of criminal jurors to find leakers.
He also said that for the recordings of the Washington Post reporters and editors, a court order should be made - that's something that the reporters would certainly protest against.
Senator Mike Lee of Utah's Republic said on Thursday at Capitol Hill that there should be a criminal procedure for leaking classified information.
"We have to find the person who leaked them - he must be punished, and he must be fired," said Lee Fox News, "America's News HQ."
"This is unacceptable, and that should never happen."
Lee, who worked as a lawyer before he was elected to the Senate in 2010, said that such a leak was a "crime, a very serious federal crime".
"This action should and should be accompanied not only by dismissal, but also by criminal proceedings, given that there are classified information involved," he said.
Fox News was told that at this stage, the Friday announcement by the Ministry of Justice may rather provide an overview of what the Ministry of Justice hopes to achieve rather than explain certain procedures.
Last week, President Sessions was criticised and publicly expelled his anger on the Prosecutor, claiming that the latter has not worked enough to find leakers.
"I want the D.A. to be much harder on the leaks coming from the security agencies," said Trump on July 25th in the rose garden.
The sessions themselves confessed last week to Fox News Tucker Carlson that he was not satisfied with the leaks that have been made to the president since his inauguration repeatedly insurgent efforts to investigate.
"I have not been satisfied with criminal leaks in previous procedures and investigations," said sessions.
Even some people who are critical of the President have accepted leaks, saying that such a course is detrimental to foreign policy efforts.
"The leaking of a transcript between the president and the foreign leader is unprecedented, shocking and dangerous," wrote David Frum atlanticus on Thursday.
"It is extremely important that the President can communicate confidentially - and perhaps even more importantly, so that foreign leaders can understand that they can answer confidentially."
Senator Mark Warner (D-Va), the head Democrat of the Senate Security Committee, also told The Daily Beast that the leak is "resolutive" and that it should be examined by the Congress.
10 horrific advertising tricks to make the appearance of food more attractive
Since many foods are difficult to take pictures, the picture uses a different ingredient that deceives people, for example, a potato potato stick instead of a glue or an ice cream.
Youtube channel Top Trending makes an overview of what tricks are quite common in the advertising world.
If someone opens a popcorn pack in advertising or takes a hamburger out of the box, there will be a lot of good steam out of it.
In reality, it is longer and hot food does not damp during this period because the damp comes from a high water content that, for example, does not exist in soap products.
Therefore, cotton balloons put in the packaging or food are covered in water with the ability to absorb and keep water in it.
In the direct surroundings of the heat, they boil much longer than a hamburger or popcorn, and the product gets a freshly prepared appearance.
Potato powder is a great helper for photographers because it will not melt in the hands of light or heat or significantly change the consistency of many other foods.
For example, the cake may be a potato bottle instead of a cream full or ice ice cream.
A few colours and decorative elements, and the consumer is once again deceived.
The lime replaces milk.
Milk is also not easy to take pictures, because it may not look so white at all.
The foods served with milk are also quick to squeeze inside it.
Because, for example, morning flies or cosmetics must look crimpy and tasty in milk, a glue is used instead of milk, and no flame will pass through.
If restaurants can work hard to make meat so that the result is sausaged and quite mature, it will not be promoted.
However, the meat presented in the advertisement looks particularly attractive, as it came directly from a barbecue.
However, it is often fried on a ready pan, or made in a furnace, and draws grills for meat after shoe wax.
It's just as difficult to work with the shrimp as ice cream, because it tends to melt.
Fortunately, there is a product that is almost identical to the appearance of shrimp - a shrimp.
So it may be advertised on cakes or berries or inside the milk cocktail.
Even on the top of the fruits sold in the store, there may be a thin wax layer that makes their appearance shiny.
However, that is not enough for the photograph, and it is sprayed with deodorant to add a shiny to the fruit.
Also, the dews are not photogenic, because they are liquidating or dissolving water, for example, over time.
Here comes a wax with bright colors and a more permanent texture allowing you to make an attractive appetite.
Wash has probably been used in pictures where melting chocolate flows on cake or ice cream.
If you notice the ideal cross-sectioned cake in the ad, where the biscuit ratio is ideal, there are probably some extra layers or pieces of papi.
That's because by cutting off the cake, you can disperse in the filling and ruin the picture.
If after cutting the cake into the pieces of papi and spray them with a fuller filling, it makes a visually much more beautiful impression.
The priest and button needles are also used inside the hamburger so that all the ingredients there can be accurately arranged to keep them still.
That's why a burger doesn't look the way he's in advertising on the table.
The paper is a complete chicken.
Advertisement looks like a oven that looks like sausage and full, but it may not even be prepared for cooking.
To add a full impression, the chicken's full paper will be sprayed, if necessary, with the potato bottle mentioned above, and then the chicken will be sprayed with brown colour.
The pancakes are poured especially in American advertising with wax syrup, because this image creates a great pancoagism in people.
In fact, the cakes quickly absorb the syrup, and the flowing syrup will disappear quickly from the eyes of the photographer.
Therefore, each pancake is sprayed over the couch with a cleansing tool that helps to avoid rapid absorption.
Often, it is not helpful, and therefore, gold - brown engine oil is being used to help, which is poured on warm pancakes and presented as syrup.
A former soldier was sentenced to a prisoner for the murder of a suspected pensioner of sexual abuse.
A former soldier was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison for the murder of a man suspected of the abuse of his known wife.
Richard Cassidy (70) was sentenced to the High Court of Glasgow in June for the murder of David Farish (75) at his home in Tweedbank Roxburghshire in February 2016.
Judge Lord Summers called murder "particularly cruel" because the victim's body had 14 incision wounds.
Defense Advocate Brian McConnachie said that killing was caused by "a momentary madness," but he described the circumstances as "experienced".
Cassidy heard that Farish had been sexually abused by a woman for a long time.
His attorney said that the man went home to Farish and he was "friendly" with him in the hope to hear a confession, not to kill him.
Lord Summers claimed that Cassidy showed signs of intention on the day of the attack, and showed a social work report, which showed that the defendant had completed the training of Special Forces in the Army on how to infiltrate groups by making friends.
Farish had not been charged with any charges.
The court reported that after the murder, Cassidy contacted the police himself and turned himself in.
McConnachie stated that most people have a hard time to understand that Cassidy is capable of murder.
The defense attorney said, "He hasn't had any problems before this incident.
He lived a full life until the moment of his madness in February 2016."
Cassidy’s health is allegedly poor and has been hit by heartbeat and stroke while he is in custody.
According to Lord Summers, he took into account, with a minimum 17-year-old imprisonment, the fact that Cassidy had no previous convictions and what was allegedly told about Farish.
The Scottish police described the case as "a very scary murder of a male in his own home at a premature age".
Detective David Pinkney said, "Although this punishment does not make his cruel actions unwise, I hope it will give David's family some kind of solution."
On Monday, the last opportunity was to propose a nice name for the nose tail that was born at the beginning of June.
Animal gardeners now have a large box of names to look at the right one to celebrate on the birthday of the zoo on August 25th.
But a name can be given to the natives until the day of their independence.
From the beginning of August, a whole nose horn family sees side by side walking in the garden.
And even though Father Kigoma occasionally runs around and moves garden posts with horns, his mother will not be allowed to disturb Kibib, but the nose tails will receive valuable lessons.
Although the birth climax has passed, on August 1, the yoghurt and two homeboats saw the light on him.
On the rock hill, a warm summer day may be on bathing eagles.
On the cockins, the gits of their original appearance, began the running time.
There was another Vivacolor color day in the zoo on Thursday.
A large number of good helpers painted the new camel house, the garden posts of the bride’s large gardener, and the male elephant’s terrace.
In order not to interfere with the painters, the bridesmaids spent time with Fien and Draay again with the male Elephant Carl.
On August 9, on the second day of the classical day of the zoo, Aavo Otsa’s trompetianism.
The zoo can be used as a memorial for the acquisition of crucifixes and pears and other fine memories.
Benefits for charity sales will be supported by the relevant type-protection project.
On the tiger day last week, more than EUR 1000 was collected on charity sales.
It is worth knowing: how to calculate the amount of sugar in the dairy product?
"The food labelling standards of the European Union indicate the quantity of carbohydrates and the quantity of sugars, which is not equal to the quantity of white, so-called table sugar", confirmed Krista Kalbin, the marketing director of Valio Estonia.
According to him, three types of sugar in dairy products are in fact: milk lactose, natural milk sugar, glucose and fructose in fruits, and added sugar, or sucrose.
However, in the light of a few simple facts, according to Kalbin, the calculation of the added sugar content in the product should not be difficult.
Firstly, it must be clear whether it is a milk or an acidified milk product.
Normal milk and milk drinks contain approximately 5 grams of natural milk sugar, or lactose per 100 grams of product.
In acidified dairy products, yogurt or cherry strippers have consumed part of lactose during the acidification process, thereby oxidising in dairy products, on average 3,5g/100 g of the product.
"In order to calculate the quantity of added sugar, lactose must first be calculated from the quantity of sugars," said Kalbin.
It is now necessary to calculate the amount of sugar from the berries and fruits of fructose and glycose.
"In general, fructose and glucose flavoured dairy products have 3-4% common grain content of ca 0,3 grams, especially in fruit-containing products of a 15% fertility content of up to 1,5 grams per 100 grams", said Kalbin.
According to him, this simple calculation indicates that the proportion of added sugar in beet yogurts may be up to twice the percentage of sugar indicated on the packaging.
In the case of lactose-free products, the situation is slightly different as sugar content depends on production technology.
Comparison of the most popular spa packages: from nightclub tickets to sauna rituals
The customer delivery of the poster compared the cheaper packages offered by spas for one person for one night on 11-12 August.
"Spahotels have a different level and service option, so one comparison on the basis of the price is very difficult," said the sales manager of OÜ Spa Tours, Mario Sau.
Compared to accommodation contracts with spa facilities, it appears that the prices of the most favourable packages vary several times and that options are available for both more demanding customers and for more modest holidays.
For example, if a traveller alone can spend 51 euros in a one-time room in Värska Spa's water centre with a buffet dinner and breakfast and unlimited use of water parks, gyms and saunas, then a package of EUR 287 will be available for one person when visiting the Pädaste mansion in Muhumaa.
It includes accommodation in the Double Deluxe category room, breakfast restaurant Alexander winter garden and a half-day spa package "Train and moisture".
When selecting and comparing different packages, it should be taken into account that a friend or companion should go on vacation for the most favourable price, since overnighting in two rooms will be more advantageous than taking a single room.
However, if it is a desire to rest alone, special single rooms and double-digit rooms are offered to the visitor according to their place.
In general, if an unpaid traveller has to pay just a €20 extra fee for being alone in a two-digit room, it is possible to find more favourable options by compromise.
For example, Fra Mare Thalasso Spas, located in Haapsalu, will pay the package by overnight in a single room of EUR 86, but if you wish, you will also be offered a more favourable opportunity to stay in a double room, provided that, in the event of a lack of space, someone else is informed by the customer in advance.
In this case, the price of the package will be EUR 58.
It is worth being flexible to obtain the most favourable deal.
The prices of the packages are dynamic, or then depend on the day of the week and the performance.
"For the most favourable package, prices may vary from EUR 112 to EUR 248," explained Triinu Teras, Sales and Marketing Manager of V SpaHotel, Tartu, their price policy.
He also pointed out that the price in their hotels is variable, depending on the performance, and added that the customer generally receives the cheapest price by booking directly from their homepage or by asking for the offer itself.
Since the summer period is the fastest for spas, it is worth planning a vacation in time to avoid the situation where the desired place is sold out.
For example, on August 11, Pärnu Hedon Spa as well as Beach Spa and the conference hotel, only suites have been chosen for comparison of packages, and the Gulf of Vihula in the Gulf of Gulf has been sold out.
You don't need to find a way to spend relaxing holidays: you can find one or more spas in almost every larger Estonian city.
At the same time, it is worth examining before buying the package, and at the same time there are no major events in the vicinity, as it will immediately increase prices.
For example, until 11-13 August, Haapsala will take place at the White Lady events.
At this time, Haapsalu has a great number of tourists, demand for accommodations, and we have high prices at this time.
"We do not have accommodation at this time at a favourable price or favorable package", commented head of the spahotel Laine Irene Vääda.
The Chinese company from Mulu to Estonia made a turnover of EUR 100 million immediately
Agritera, the Chinese owned agricultural production seller, which only started operations last year, reached a turnover of nearly EUR 100 million.
The profits were earned by almost 2 million euros, writes business day.
The company’s annual report shows that Agritera OÜ’s sales revenue for the purchase and wholesale of agricultural production amounted to EUR 100.6 million in 2016.
Profit earned EUR 1.91 million.
A year earlier, there was no economic activity in the company.
An average of 3 people worked in soil, and in 2015 there were no employees.
The turnover per employee amounted to EUR 33.6 million, with an average gross premium of EUR 316 per month.
Jüri Kolk: rest all year, so you don't need any rest.
Of course, it was my fault that this vacation was unruly.
I guess I was also somewhat needed, but I think I was the only one who thought I was indispensable.
It's my fault that stupid sense of duty put me in my chest.
The quote at the beginning of the column is good for the fact that it is entirely true.
So the new agency I started in March that same year demanded a lot of work, but something was so much better for me that I recovered from a completely new life in three months, and I rested.
It's still summer, it's vacation time.
It's time to give new-year promises, look at what's happened in life, and what direction all this stuff is going to rip.
"It's Christmas for this and the change of the year!" now some decent citizen calls badly.
Maybe it is, but we all know from our experience that Christmas is not suitable for thinking about life and setting targets.
All right, all I'm talking about is for myself. I can't make any changes during the year.
It's too hard for me.
Of course, there is happiness and joy in the stages of Christmas: I enjoy knowing the rivals of the light that begins, enjoying Christmas revenues, and also Jesus was a most sympathetic, revolutionaryly-minded guy.
Nevertheless, during Christmas, I am mostly very tired and sometimes stressed - already because of this darkness.
Yeah, I'm doing a lot of work living on vacation, maybe more than I do in some fucking slaughterhouse, and I'm constantly resting.
Most of the time before Christmas, I have run like a squirrel on a bike - gifts, at least four Christmas parties, a little higher load at work ...
Taking into account the constant societal pressure to experience unconditional joy and peace in the heart, the difficulties of Christmas times are evident.
But a desperate and tired person can't make good decisions, long ago, improve them for a plan.
These things need to be done with a little bit of a clear head.
A tired person may blow up an empty and loud promise that will help to store the foundation of the future as much as buying a lottery ticket.
A promise that is designed to change something should be considered peacefully. It should benefit, it should be a plan.
The plan, so unlike the promise, contains not only the purpose of conduct, but also the direction of action, and it does not go down because of a few little relapses.
That's why I'm saying that the best time to drop promises is now, in the summer.
You just need to relax and find out why it is so fatigue (if it is).
If you do not oblige yourself to rap like a calve that escaped during your vacation, it will be enough for a couple of weeks to find a hook in your life that deserves to be straightened, and figure out how exactly it can be done.
I think it's important to live as much as possible so that I don't need a vacation, not one time a year.
So that vacation would be an additional service, not a bus stop needed to survive, where it is loaded so much that it can survive next year.
I recommend to everyone at least one simple summer promise - if you have to get up at a certain time next morning, get some sleep early in the evening.
I believe that if every ten of the Posters readers would respond to my recommendation, life in Estonia would be much better.
I'm going to follow my advice.
We already have a Thursday week of work, but not what we're waiting for.
Photo: Scanpix, PantherMedia / Wavebreakmedia ltd
Many Estonians have already found their unknown desire for Thursday's week of work.
But not as they would expect, business day writes.
It has been created by modern workplace planning, i.e. open office.
In the office of walls, a renowned management magazine Harvard Business Review reports that employees spend almost 1.5 hours a day, or almost a full day of work, a week.
However, if four working days and three holidays are meant for a Thursday working week, such a forced solution is worse than that.
It takes 1.5 hours of working time with the family and instead of hobbies or holiday recovery time, it has been decorated with concentration difficulties, mixing work, increasing irritation and anxiety and the loss of work.
The third festival day of Weekend sends a strong wind.
Thus, the imager of the evening leaves ahead of the camera eye, a troubled echo that tries to fly in the wind.
Due to the wind, many festivalists say that the mouth and eyes are full of sand.
How a man built a theme park paying his daughter $51 million
A Texas father discovered that there was no theme park where his disability daughter could play.
So he decided to build one himself.
Gordon Hartman just came out of the pool when his 12-year-old daughter Morgan approached other children playing in the water.
He tried to be friends with them, but they quickly left the pool.
Hartman thinks they were frightened because they don't know how to treat a disabled person - Morgan has a five-year cognitive understanding and also a certain form of autism.
This incident was haunted by him.
"Morgan is a lovely young girl.
Meeting him always brings a smile to the mouth, and he certainly wants to hug.
But there have been many times that we have not been able to take him to different places," he says.
Hartman and his wife, Maggie, asked other parents where they could take their daughter, somewhere where she would feel comfortable and others would feel good in dealing with him.
"We considered that there was no such inclusive place," says Hartman.
So in 2007, he decided to build it himself.
The former real estate developer sold its home construction companies in 2005 to establish The Gordon Hartman Family Foundation - a non-profit partnership that helps disabled people.
Then he started creating the first highly accessible theme park in the world.
"We wanted to create a theme park where everyone can do everything that can play for people with special needs and without special needs," says Hartman.
He invited doctors, therapists, parents and other disabled and disabled people to consult about the facility.
They were set up in a 10-hectar abandoned career in San Antonio, Texas.
A park named Morgan's Wonderland paid $34 million (€26 million) and was opened in 2010.
The attractions include a fully accessible spectacle, a adventure-providing game field and a mini train.
Visitors often tell Hartman that they were only able to experience such attractions for the first time.
There are also carussells with wheelchairs specially designed for wheelchairs that move up and down next to the animals.
But Hartman realizes that Morgan was in the first place afraid of driving.
"When we opened, he didn't dare go to it.
He didn't understand why it went around and why the animals move up and down," says Hartman.
It took me three years before Morgan agreed to go to the carussell.
"In the beginning, he just stood close to it, then he sat on the animal, but we didn't start the ride.
It was a slow process, but now he likes to drive it.
Overcoming something that frightened him meant a lot for him.
The small things that have been achieved in the games make a big difference."
Since its opening, Morgan's Wonderland has visited over a million people from 67 countries and all 50 States of America.
A third of the staff is disabled and entry is free of charge for all who have a condition.
"I realized Morgan was one of the happy ones because he had a lot of things to do with him.
I didn't want the price to be an obstacle to other people with special needs," says Hartman.
"We open up every year, knowing that we are going to lose at least a million dollars (750 000 pounds) and we have to earn it back with the help of collectors and partners."
This year the theme park was expanded by opening up a fully accessible water park in Morgan's Inspiration Island.
"In July, fewer people visited the park because the wheelchairs became too hot.
So we decided to build a water park aside," says Hartman.
In some parts of the island, warm water has been used to help visitors with muscle problems.
There are waterproof wheelchairs with motorised wheelchairs that work with pressure air, not batteries.
It's also possible to drive a boat on the river.
The water park paid a total of $17 million (£13 million).
"Gisteren, a man on Inspiration Island came to me and just kept my hand," says Hartman.
"He referred to his son, who has serious special needs, and started crying.
He said his son hadn't been able to play in the water before."
According to Hartman, three of the four guests in the park do not have trees, and the park has exactly what he expected to do.
"This helps people to understand that although we are different in certain ways, we are actually exactly the same," he says.
"I saw a girl in a wheelchair go to another girl without special needs, and they started playing together.
That was really awesome."
Hartman is not planning to open any more parks, although he has received hundreds of letters from people who would like to have a park next door and by mail.
Instead, he focuses on providing educational facilities for young people with special needs in San Antonio.
"I know there are many different organisations trying to build something similar to Morgan's Wonderland, and we will continue to cooperate with them," he adds.
He's still taking Morgan to the theme park to play - Morgan is there now some sort of celebrity.
"When he comes here, he's like a rock star!
Many people want to talk to him and take a picture with him, he can handle it well," says Hartman.
Morgan, now 23-year-old, is getting better at things.
"He's talking more now, and most of his physical problems have been resolved by numerous operations.
We're so proud that he's gotten this far."
When he visits Morgan's park, he likes to play the most on swings and sand, without knowing how much he's helped others.
"Morgan knows that the park has been named after him, but I don't think he understands what it actually represents and how it's changed lives," says Hartman.
"He doesn't understand that the way he's handled things in life has made him a real source of inspiration."
U18 head trainer Vaido Rego: Play-off game can decide one or two shots
In the Estonian U18-aged basketball group, a quarter-final of EMI B-divisjon, Poland 68:63, the main trainer Vaido Rego said it was a real play-off meeting.
The game was rude.
Both teams had done homework, points came hard.
It's a game with better nerves.
Play-off could be one or two whiskey game," he discussed.
Yes, but the coach is looking for something to fix first.
Nurisesa always does.
Some of our mistakes were not justified, the opponent received light free shots and lived on them.
That's what's happened before - if you're going to protect yourself aggressively, there's a risk of overwhelming.
Let's draw our conclusions," said Rego.
He used nine players today, and Robin Kivi was still on the bench due to the injury of some meeting.
These decisions are taking place on a running basis.
The stone carried out morning training and pre-game warming, but was not prepared by a hundred percent," explains the instructor.
Tomorrow at 18.15 p.m., the Estonian semifinal meets with Britain, who today defeated Bulgaria 76:73.
The winner of this game will raise the U18 age class of his country to the EMI A division next summer.
Video: Vasiljev already created a second penal for a new club
In the ninth minute of Wroclawi Slaski’s play on the homefield, the Piazzan had a loss, but 20 minutes later he was able to fig.
Vasiliev had a great opportunity to secure Piast’s first victory in the season.
Four minutes before the normal time was completed, the half-defense hit the penal.
The match ended with 1:1 fiction.
The market has gathered two points in four rounds and is located on the 15th of the predecessor.
How can you keep sex exciting when you're trying to have a baby?
It is therefore very important to keep the passion in the air even if you are trying to create a new life.
Female First advises how to make sex not seem an annoying obligation.
Don't consider it an obligation
This could happen to every couple trying to get pregnant.
Sometimes it may take years to become pregnant.
Sexing after a command takes away spontaneousness and romance.
Try to be spontaneous!
Women often feel that they can't enjoy "normal" sex at the end of the cycle if it is known that there is no positive result.
This creates tension in the relationship, which, in turn, leads to a reduction in sex and, of course, less sex means a even greater chance not to become pregnant.
Men, however, feel that they must be able to "go" when they are required.
If you know your fruitful days ahead, it can help you plan something romantic with a dear.
Be a special dinner or just spending time together - enjoy each other!
Consider the fruitful period.
From the point of view of reproduction, there is no point in having sex when ovulation has occurred, but in order for your relationship to bloom, try to have sex for fun in days that are not fruitful.
Although there is no evidence that pregnancy will occur more if a woman gets orgasm, do not forget it!
Remember, each pair is different.
Everyone can deal with baby stress differently.
Some men want to be familiar with the woman's cycle, but others prefer not to know that they don't feel pressure on "for demand".
No one knows better than you are, how you're best suited.
Find your own solution!
Studies have shown that a higher success has couples who have sex every few days, but not every couple can keep such a density.
The most important thing is to find a pattern that fits you as a couple best.
IAAF warns that frauds will be monitored sharply at the London World Championships
On Friday, light force world championships begin in London, and athletes are in more than ever in the light of doping candales.
These world championships are the first to be guarded by the new organ, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), which also monitors corruption, gambling and the counterfeiting of results.
"It is not possible to rule out that the nature of people does not allow such things to happen.
However, we can say that we have the best practices and the best anti-doping programme that can be at all, based on information and data collection, and we will see the outcome after the event," said David Howman, the representative of the AIU.
AIU has allowed 19 athletes to compete as neutral athletes for around 190 Russian athletes who have been caught with drugs.
Responsible: Levadia destroyed the Paide City Team on the homefield
Levadia has put itself in a difficult situation, because in the previous round, Viljandi’s future was surprisingly lost in the foreign world, and the table leader Flora took advantage of the opportunity offered by slipping seven points away.
From the back, Levadia has reached the same stump, but the Nerd Rock has reached.
Paide continues to miss the captain and the central emperor, Andre Frolov, who is constituting the summer transition window.
Of the last seven games, only two fig points have been pounded, the overtable is on the eighth place - Tartu Eimmekast four points down and the future in turn four points ahead.
Levadia has lost Paide in the first game between 0:7 and the second 2:5.
"My watch died, but I didn't," the actor Raivo E. Tamme shined in the face of Ironman's 70.3 finishing smile.
True, during the entire half-long triatlon, a smile didn't even come out of Raivo.
Even more, running 21,1 kilometers, he ran into a talk attack, "I talked to one person during the run, one man ran by and wondered, "Lord, you can still talk!"
At the run-off station, Raivo went to share energy even to tell you, a few times over to the high-speed.
At the coach's recommendation.
"Ain-Alar Juhanson said that the uphill can be walked so that there is no point in pushing away, because there are these elevations, and timelessly, it doesn't really matter whether you run or walk fast," says an actor that he took the advice from the triatleed guide.
At the same time, he was able to breathe the walking times, and after crossing the finish line, he was able to share unattended links and right interviews.
As if there weren't 1,9 kilometres behind the back, 90 kilometres of bike and 21,1 km running.
"I don't think that my training is such as to enjoy this competition," admits in January that Raivo has started training and lost 16 kilograms of its weight today, and he is happy to chewing.
And with regard to the interviews, it was my wish to be able to give me interviews after the finishing.
After every competition, I've been able to do interviews, and I was hoping it would be nice to be able to do it after Otepää Ironman.
I thought it would be all right if I weren't on the ground after Ironman. In contrast to the scary lenses in the country, Raivo offered a different picture by crossing the finish line: hands viciously towards the sky, and in the face, a genuine triumph.
There was also a reason: Raiva spent 1,9 kilometres to swim for 46 minutes and 24 seconds, 90 kilometres of bike for 3 hours and 32 minutes and 21,1 kilometres running for 2 hours and 18 minutes.
"My heart has now been given to the triatlon," confirms Raivo, who already called at the finishes, gave a finger to sport, and it took the ring's jackpot.
I have already registered my 20th August Gran Fondo - 230 km from Tallinn to Tartu on a bike!
So practice again tomorrow!
Disney's long-term advisor and manager Marty Sklar died 83 years old
Sklar, who died on July 27 in his home in the Hollywood Hills neighbourhood of Los Angeles, maintained a relationship with the company after retiring in 2009, which was exactly scheduled for the 54th anniversary of the opening of Disneyland.
Last year, he became the only member of the Shanghai Disney in China on the opening day (so the company calls his employees) who has participated in the opening of all 12 Disney parks worldwide.
And less than two weeks before he died, he attended the Disney fans' convention D23, sharing memories of Disneyland.
His death was reported by Disney Company, not to mention its cause.
He was 83 years old.
Sklar’s post as editor of The Disneyland News was temporary, but he returned to disneyland for U.C.L.A. in 1956 to work in its advertising department.
He soon became Walt Disney's main shadowmaker in writing advertising materials, dedications, souvenir leaders, speeches, slogans, presentations and short films, such as a book that helped the company to obtain approval for the construction of Walt Disney World and Epcot in Central Florida.
He also worked with Walt and his brother Roy on Disney's annual reports.
"These were quite dizzy times for a person who was nearing his 30th birthday and had only six or seven years of college graduation," wrote Sklar in his autobiography "Dream It! Do It: My Half-Century Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms" (2013).
However, despite the trust of Walt Disney in writing, he appointed Sklar to the Ford Pavilion at the New York World Fair in 1964, where Disney Company designed exhibitions and attractions.
Sklar wrote to Walt Disney a story about the attraction of the Ford Pavilion for Magic Skyway, where he could see animated dinosaurs and cavemen, which was their main link with large corporation sponsors.
It was the beginning of Sklar's second act in the company.
As a leader of ever-growing member and Imagineers, he was increasingly bound to Walt Disney’s legacy, who died a long time before the opening of Walt Disney World in 1971 and the opening of Epcot in 1982.
After Walt Disney died as a result of lung cancer at the age of 65, Sklar was put back in the writing world when he was told that the company's leading staff had not prepared a public speech, although "it was no secret that Walt was dying," as he writes in his autobiography.
Sklar felt frustrated that he had to sign a statement to which Roy Disney would sign, but he realized that deficient planning was a sign of Walt Disney's death being paralyzed by the company's leaders.
"Actually, they were all terrified to death," wrote Sklar.
Martin Adrian Sklar was born in February in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
Her father, Leon, was a teacher and mother, Lilyn Fuchs, who was a maiden name, worked in Johnson & Johnson, before the family moved to Long Beach to California when Marty was 12.
After high school he had a number of temporary jobs, for example, he worked in Douglas Airraft, as an ice cream compiler in hamburger restaurant Drive-in as well as as as a packager for postal services.
But in May 1955, when his third year in U.C.L.A. ended, Sklar received a message to call Disney's marketing and advertising director E. Cardon Walker.
At that time Sklar U.C.L.A. was the new editor of the Daily Bruin.
Walker asked him to come to a job interview for the creator and editor's job in The Disneyland News.
Walker said the theme park was about to open up.
And it needs him.
Walker hired him after 20 minutes of interviews.
Sclar had to prove to Walt Disney that he knew what he was doing.
"I had been working there for two weeks, and I had to give Walt Disney a page concept," reminded him of his pocket audio broadcast on Disney Avenue's website.
"If Walt hadn't liked it, he would have thrown me out of the door and hired a professional.
But fortunately, Walt liked it.
I was 21.
It was scary.
I've never worked at a professional level."
Sklar formed the lessons of Walt Disney (and some other people) at one point as the Manifest of the theme park Board.
The orders include, for example, the following.
Try to "get into the shoes of the visitors" to experience attraction like them.
Tell me only one story at a time for each attraction.
The topical entertainment expert, Bob Rogers, once called Sklar as a "trainer student" - the role Miki-Mir played in Disney's Film "Fantasia" (1940) - because he had intermediated Disney's philosophy to three designers generations.
His wife, Leah Gerber, her daughter Leslie Sklar, her son Howard and four grandchildren, leaves him behind.
Sklar was a dedicated leader of Disney.
He regularly wore the miki-hiire watch (which showed him time in Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo) and the gold ring of Miki-Hijre.
And he never forgot anything Walt Disney had taught him.
When Disney Company developed the childhood area of California Adventure Park, Sklar reminded the designers that they would add activities that parents and children could do together, as Walt Disney had requested.
"I reminded everyone that Disneyland existed at all because Walt used to take his daughters Diane i and Sharoni to the Griffith Park for a carussell," he said to The Los Angeles Times in 2002, "and Daddy had to sit on a park bank and eat peanuts and popcorn until the children were alone driving."
Police took over 200 people to the station during Weekend.
Over 20 crimes were recorded in the city of Pärnu in the days of the festival.
There is a reason to link around half of them to the music party, with the use of violence, a large number of drug possessions and two drinking managements recorded.
Hundreds of criminal proceedings initiated were mainly related to the use or possession of minors or prohibited substances who consumed alcohol.
The letter was received by some robbery and a violation of public law.
For various reasons more than 200 people were brought by lawkeepers to the police station.
About half a hundred of them were minors and mostly the reason for transporting alcohol to the police station was.
I had more than half the minors brought to the station.
Also, half a hundred people were taken, i.e. as much as last year.
Andres Sinimer, head of the Pärnu police station, is expected in view of the great crowd.
As in previous years, we were thoroughly prepared for the weekend this year.
We joined additional forces from other prefectures, police cadetten and assistants in order to ensure readyness to react quickly.
Most of the situations were resolved by a word and sufficient for the communication of regularists with citizens.
"I don't think there's a lot of bad things left out, because the police had to see and feel enough in the city," said Bluemer.
According to his opinion, it was extremely positive that the minors who had been alcoholic were evidently less, and the youths proved to be able to celebrate.
He commended the top-level security team of the security company who took care of the security of the festival.
I thank all the festival audiences who kept themselves up politely and partyed safely.
"I also thank the local residents who, with their understanding, contributed to the successful event of the major festival," said the police director.
At the Pärnu police station, the owners are waiting for items found in town and festival over the weekend.
According to Annika Pärna, the manager of Pärnu’s service responsible for returning findings in the festival area, the items lost this year were less than bubbles.
At the festival’s police tent, more than half of the findings were repatriated to the owners.
The highest number of bank cards, identity documents, mobile phones and keys were lost within three days.
"There are 13 mobile phones, three wallets, a laptop, a rope and several car keys waiting for the owner at the station," he listed Pärna.
A 101-year-old man jumped off the plane.
Verdun Hayes, a veterinarian of World War II, has recently received a military prize to celebrate his world record of parachutes.
For instance, a man of 101 years and 38 days of violence, making him the oldest man who made a parachute jump in the world.
Business group urges the government to agree on the conditions of the Brexit transition
One of the largest business lobbyist groups in Britain encourages the government to stop dancing around Brexit’s perils.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) called on the government to conclude a "accession agreement" with Brexit to make progress smooth.
It is desirable that the government creates a "Brexit Salmon" bridge between leaving the EU and setting up new trade agreements.
The group warned that, without such a contract, business was ahead of "a short-term chaotic rotsing at the edge of the rock".
They criticised the government for the involvement of "in all speculative disputes about the transition".
In recent weeks, government members have expressed controversial views on how long the transition period will last and what it will bring to themselves.
The IoD report "Brexit Salmon - opportunities for transition" states: " Instead of a long way to put the problem into practice, the government must create a strategic debate around this issue.
This could minimise the growing confusion and uncertainty in this area."
Gerard Lyons, economists and the group Economists for Brex, however, this week, he described his concern about "storey-sided" Brexit as "the story of panic-producers", which resembles Y2K's computer program error during the Millennium Change.
Deputy Chancellor Philip Hammond warned in June: "There are a large number of business investments that will be postponed until companies see more clearly what the likely outcome of these discussions is."
Allie Renison, Head of the IoD EU and Trade Policy, said: "Kantsler has the right to worry about the prolongation of business investments.
This is one of the most frequent changes that have to be addressed in relation to Brexit, alongside the relocation of operations in the EU.
The latter shall apply in particular to members in Northern Ireland who are currently considering joint placement or relocation."
IoD proposes a number of options, including the following: Extension of Article 50 Agreement from March 2019
Accession to the European Economic Area
Responsibility to remain longer in the EU legislative government
Establishment of a transitional Customs Agreement, similar to the EU Customs Union
Renison said: "IoD offered these opportunities with regard to the transition, in the hope that it would cause an appropriate debate on how it would be best to finish Brext.
Priorising interim arrangements and thereby mitigating the risks of exit from the EU means that short-term chaotic rots fluctuations do not diminish future opportunities."
Russian Railway is investigating the possibility of entering the Petersburg-Kaliningrad-Berlin passenger train
Russia’s railway is investigating the possibility of entering the Berlin-Peterburi train route through Kaliningrad, and informed Viktor Golomolzin Interfax Severo-Zapad, the director of Kaliningrad railway.
The passenger traffic monitoring indicates that from an economic point of view, it is hardly possible to reboot the Kaliningrad-Berlin trains.
And we offer another route - Berlin-Kaliningrad-Peterburi.
Technical possibilities for this are available for both infrastructure and rolling stock," said Golomolzin.
Golomolzin also noted that there are already Russian trains that can exchange track width and continue to move on the European track width.
Golomolzin believes that this direction is perspective, because now the inhabitants of St. Petersburg and the entire northwest of Russia must travel to Germany through Moscow and Brest.
As a possible option, the route is discussed through Latvia, confirmed by the Latvian Delfile Latvian railway representative Māris Ozols, who said that there is no specific decision at present, but the option is being discussed.
Latvia's railways, together with partners, including Russia's rail, are looking for an opportunity to increase competitiveness in passenger flows in order to allow rail transport to compete with road transport.
Pakistan's Hindus in India aren't a shelter.
70 years after the largest population migration in the history of the two countries began, Hindus are still moving from Pakistan to India.
Tens of thousands of people, who have no legal right to work in India, are already waiting for these camps at the border of two countries.
Thus, many people have no choice but to shave illegally near temporary habitats in stone breaks - the Indian authorities monitor the movements of the border in a very sharp manner on the other hand.
Most of Pakistan's arrivals can't expect that kind of reception.
No job, no house, no money, no food.
That's where we worked in the fields, we were peasants.
This is where people like us are forced to break stones to earn a living," said the 81-year-old in Jogda.
It's not over for us.
The Hindus are still trying to return to their country.
And when they come here, they have nothing," added the elderly man living in a field camp near the city of Jodhpur.
After India’s independence from British colonial power in 1947, over 15 million people lost their homes.
Dissolution caused a monthly wave of violence, in which at least a million people lost their lives because of religious hatred.
In the middle of the blood chaos, Hindus and Sikhs fled from the newly formed Pakistan, while Muslims moved in the opposite direction.
Despite the migration, Hindus are still one of Pakistan's most numerous minorities.
In different estimates, they account for about 1.6 per cent of the population of the country, 200 million.
Many of them complain about constant discrimination and fear robbery, rape and forced marriages.
"Retreatment began shortly after the divorce," said Jogdas, whose family moved only a few months before the divergence of two countries to escape from the drought in the current Pakistani territories.
Not even the day we could have lived in peace.
I wanted to come back to live with my Hindu brothers.
The national government of Prime Minister Narendra Mod of India has said that he wants to make it easier for those who are persecuted for religious reasons to find refuge in India.
Last year, the government began to allow immigrants to apply for citizenship at their place of residence, before all the business went through central government.
Hindus moving from Pakistan to India will open up the opportunity for fast citizenship after seven years of residence in the country.
However, due to bureaucratic delays, this process is often much more time-consuming.
The 64-year-old Khanaramji left Pakistan in 1997 and became Indian citizenship in 2005.
He said, however, that many have abandoned and returned to Pakistan because they see that they do not expect a good life in India.
The government does not provide any support.
We're like livestock without owner.
We're just trying to survive on our own," said Khanaramji.
But even worse than poverty is the scepticism of the authorities.
Those who do not have citizenship must suffer from harassment of intelligence agencies.
They're always being treated as suspects and Pakistan's agents," he explained.
In 2014, Singh Sodhal, a charity organization in Jodhpur, to help the Hindus coming from Pakistan, had high expectations about Mod, but has now been disappointed.
During the Modi government, tensions have increased between India and Pakistan and this has caused the most migrants to suffer.
"These lives are going to be hell," said Sodhal.
For many, however, such treatment is better than life in Pakistan.
Horoji and two adult sons fled to India two years ago because he had started to get murder threats from his Pakistani neighbours.
"To save our own life, we had to flee to India," said the 65-year-old Horoji, whose grandparents were from the current India area, but found themselves wrongly on the border when the country split.
My grandfather moved to the other side of the job.
But he told us to move to India at the right time because he knew the future could become dangerous to Hindus.
I think we've been pretty well.
We have done well with our work and work," says Andres Sinimer, Head of Pärnu Police, how the first two days of Weekend's work for them have been done.
Bluemer says that today there are patrol officers and fast responders on the streets, and they also communicate with people - maybe they have questions, and they want to know how to become a fast-reactor.
In two days, the police have had to deal with some fights and drugs.
"There have also been a few treatments of a large amount of drugs, but we'll make summarys when Weekend's over," says Sinimer.
About a hundred people have been through the Pärnu police station for two days.
Fortunately, the police didn't have to solve extreme cases.
By the way, Bluemer says if it comes from the sky, and it's horizontally raining, they don't have much work.
One of Haapsalu police officers has ever said that rain is like an extra patrol.
The Pärnu police have also made a staff in Weekend, where they can take the things they found, and from there they can demand their missing things.
By the way, the police even lost one of their necessary elements, which were delivered by good people to the discovery point.
Look at the video Andres told the Sinimeri dinner page.
A number of Emmy nominated scenarios and producer Neal Baer paid $4.35 million for a home in Hollywood Hills West, whose roots go to the atomic jam.
In the middle of this century, a modernistic house was designed in 1945 by Josef Van der Kar and named it the original owners, the nuclear weapons streets Albert and Roberta Wohlstetter as the house of Wohlstetter.
The 255-ruutim house at the entrance to the gates has wide glass slidings that open to the garden, terrace and inner courtyard.
In the living and dining room, there are floor coverings, a cabinet, and moving panels that open the kitchen.
The main part of the house consists of three bedrooms and three bathrooms.
There is also a separate guest house in the building, with a view of a giant fisherman and a sleeping tax.
There is also a bathroom and an additional storage room in a separate building.
Albert Wohlstetter was a powerful nuclear road during the cold war.
Roberta Wohlstetter's analysis of scrupulous attacks before Pearl Harbor was attacked by the investigation committee on 11 September.
Worksetters have advised the presidential administrations of both Republicans and Democrats, including John F. Kennedy during the Cuban rocket crisis.
They received Ronald Reagan's Freedom Medal of the President in 1985.
Baer is the most known for his work in the TV dramas "Sicken Hospital" and "Scientific: Sexual Crime Research Unit".

The plane drew a perfect picture of itself over the US.
Pilot led a passenger plane to a national flight over the United States and was able to have a little fun on the route.
The data on the real-time flight of the aircraft indicated that it was not just a straight line or a arc, but a series of flight paths, which formed a plane image connected to each other.
According to Flightradar 24, the flight BOE004 left the airport in Boeing Field at Seattle at about 15.40 a.m. on Wednesday.
Boeing 777-8 Dreamliner took the direction east of Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota before he changed the course and flew southwest.
On the map, the strange route of the plane represents a two-engine passenger plane.
According to Boeing, the flight is part of the 18-hour "resistance" test.
" Instead of flying with an arbitrary pattern, the test team released their imagination on a route from which 22 states formed 777-8 contours," said Boeing Company representative to the RT.com portal.
"The Dreamliner's nose refers to the Puget Sound region where Boeing Commercial Airplanes is home.
The wings extend from North Michigan near the Canadian border to South Texas.
The tail touches Huntsville i Alabama," he added.
Boeing Airport 777-8 Dreamliner was introduced in 2009.
The aircraft can fit up to 242 passengers and can fly more than 13 600 kilometres.
As the pilot used the radar as a personal canvas, the flight online attracted enormous interest among aircraft trackers.
Some suspected that it was a test flight, while others suggested that it could be a strange coincidence.
The style of clothing for Estonian children is influenced by multifilms
When children are often shaped in Europe and America by the kind of children who are wearing the children of royal families or celebrities, Estonian parents choose their clothes on the basis of cinema.
The British little prince, Georg, is becoming a mother, a Duchess Cahterine, a real fashion.
Like his mother, the prince is able to fire a real buying mess in people with his clothes, which has even gained his own concept - the effect of Prince George.
The last of these events took place a few weeks ago on a royal family visit to Poland, where George carried a 10-year-old blue-rood-ced strips of the Spanish brand in Tizza, whose crazy parents bought a brand from the e-shop in 24 hours.
Of course, there was not much shoppers from Estonia, because our parents are supposed to be completely freezing by the disguised children of the kings.
The Communist Anna Ansmitt, the Communicator of the Commercial House, notes that the children of the starparents and foreign fashions in general are not affected by the purchases of our parents to their musicians.
In Estonia, the biggest trend in the purchase of children’s things is films, multicasts, and also Youtube channels.
Thus, the most popular products in recent years are fingertips, games with multiple "Frozen" characters, dolls, clothes, dancing dogs or cats, pimping wines, and so on."
At the same time, he assures us that, if you wish, your children can dress like European princesses or princesses in Estonia.
The environment does not recommend the Savisaar Preparatory Alliance
Heads of the Centre Regions across Estonia made a call to the public and to the political partners, in which they were invited to vote for the Central Party, not for the electoral unions.
This message is particularly intended for those who consider Edgar Savisaare between the electoral union and the Central Party.
How Princess Diana used her makeup as a weapon.
When I think about Princess Diana makeup, the first thing comes to my eyes.
A younger girl blue.
Later, the thick black waveline of his Martin Bashir's "Panorama" interview, whose effect was devastating when he looked up through the thick sleeves, bringing the hearable immortal phrase: "We were three in this marriage, so it was a little too crowded."
The big, nasty eyes, surrounded by his narrowness, the pale face with a thick black line, made him look like a wounded animal.
That's the effect he was trying to achieve.
Outside the public, Princess Diana never wore especially makeup, at least not according to modern standards.
It wasn't just that he didn't need it - he was, of course, beautiful - but he saw an annoying commitment in it, something more about work than pleasure.
In front of the public, he could have worn a thick makeup layer.
Once, he arrived at Conde Nasti, Vogue's publishers' office, carrying a thick, almost orange grind layer.
He apologized, saying that his skin must shine in the sun, because if he went out "usually," then the phantom photographers would take a picture of him, and then all charges would be made that he would look "sweety", "hummy" and "fat".
That is why Diana went to solarium three times a week using a machine at home.
Today, such a course would be disgusting for health reasons, but for Diana, it was a useful goal - it allowed Diana to show the world his sunny nature, even though the black clouds and donkeys filled her inside.
One of the biggest mistakes of the royal family was likely to think that if they approve him as Charles’s husband, they would be able to have a small, beautiful mammal that has only sugar wool as a brain.
But the reality was the opposite.
He didn't mean to be the best at school, but when it was about the creation of an image, he was a five-year-old student.
For Diana, the importance of hair and makeup was that they could be used to convey mood or hours.
Otherwise, he had no interest in them.
Her friend Rosa Monckton - Diana was her youngest child's godmother - remembers that makeup was nothing they used to talk about.
"I only remember that," he said, "how much relief he felt at these times when we were going to rest together and he didn't have to make any makeup."
Today, we tend to think about makeup as something that improves the appearance of a woman, but when we look back to Diana's lifecycle, it is clear that she used it as a powerful tool for a relationship.
The moments when he felt most free was most of himself, are the moments when he was also the most natural, wearing very little makeup.
In 1993, with his two young sons at Thorpe Park Loggers Leap’s attraction, he was sneaked through and laughed out of the heart, under the eyes of lipsmetuush, like any other mother who spends the day with the children.
Four months after the announcement of his and Charles' departure, he finally saw a deplorable worry and "normal".
Or in later years, pulling out the training room, putting the hair on the back, shaped legs in bicycle pants, the face redening, health and vitality blowing out of every pore.
At the end of his life, when he began to make his independence and his confidence increased, we saw more and more of this kind of Diana.
He joined Halo Trust and walked through the minefield of Angola in January 1997.
At that moment, at the age of 35, the hair was soft and natural, the face almost completely free of makeup, she probably looked more beautiful than ever, remembering that bright and hopeful young girl who smiled at the 15-year-old engagement photo.
Diana was just getting to her best years.
In the early days, young Diana Spencer had a dream before Raffael.
But it didn't take long until the "principal filing" process began, which was mainly diverted by the press and the palace to make Diana a refined young girl who would be worthy of their new position.
In part, it included Clayton Howard, a veteran make-up artist, often used by Lord Snowdon on photo sessions, hand work.
Howard met with the fearful Diana for the first time in Snowdon's City House in Kensington to keep a formal engagement picture for Vogue.
At that point, in the late 1980s, Diana was still an empty jaw.
His most delicious beauty products were from The Body Shop, such as Elderflower's eye gel.
Howard used Max Factor's grinding cream with Sheer Genius tone on Honey Touch and Max Factor's cheek with Frosted Coral.
On his eyebrows, he wore the Rice and Timberland of Elizabeth Arden, and the eyebrows with a white bully effect.
The appearance was improved by Elizabeth Arden's blue ribbon and blue pencil.
And we know all this because Howard created a face scheme for him.
"Diana's eyes are such a marvelous color that I wanted to emphasise their marvelous blueness," she wrote later.
The end result, however, is not particularly flattering for a young girl like this - she looks like a 18-year-old who's getting 50.
His eyebrows are too depressing and too boring brown on his eyes.
The most shocking thing here is the famous eyeliner on the inside of the eyelid in the blue tone of the tanning Princess of Disney.
The fantasy of the fantasy bride.
No wonder Diana's looking at us a little unsurely.
One source of Diana's anxieties was the fact that she never knew where the public person ended and begins privately.
It was the beginning of this process.
The person who was most likely affected by Diana’s appearance was Mary Greenwell, who still plays an important role in the modern make - up world.
A make-up artist, who is currently an ambassador of Chanel, is still one of the icons of the make-world.
"Diana had incredible beautiful skin and long limbs," she recalls.
"He was just beautiful.
The men loved him.
He was sexy without trying it."
Mary met Diana for the first time in 1991, when Anna Harvey asked her to make Diana make a make-up for a photo session with Patrick Demarchier, one of the most appreciated photographers in the magazine.
Sam McKnight was also part of the team.
That was when Diana and Charles had the biggest marital concerns, and the public support started sharing.
"They didn't tell us who it was, even though we knew it was someone very famous," said Greenwell.
"When we got there, Diana was just standing there beautifully, warm and friendly and extremely excited to be on the front of Vogue."
This cover - Diana in a simple black sweater, a jaw relying on her hands, her blue eyes were bright, on the nails of elegant French manicure, hair cut short - was breaking.
It was a source of positiveness, individuality, and elegantness.
Above all, it was a modern one, giving the minimalist aesthetics of the early nineties and creating a strong contrast between Diana and the royal family, who stood ahead of the "dose horribly", as the queen later called it.
"Diana was very uncomfortable about her makeup.
He just wanted to look fresh and differently," said Greenwell.
In time, he taught Diana himself makeup - cream, shaking cream, a hideous stick to raise the eyes, lipsmetuš - and stressed a healthy skin care routine, encouraging her to take good care of herself and follow the mantra "inside beauty".
Diana's "do everything moderately," says Greenwell.
He slept enough and reduced alcohol consumption, which is very important for the fresh-looking skin.
The princess preferred Guerlain's grind cream, Clarins' lipsticks, and Clinique's Wild Rose cheek.
But the greatest favor Mary did to Diana was her withdrawal from the blue eye wave.
"It just made him so much older," he said.
Instead, he used a combination of soft brown and neutral tones with a brown pencil line on a melted edge, so that all edges were beautifully soft.
Often, he used just a tinting cream and a little sunshine to highlight Diana’s healthy shiny.
"Diana used to call me and invite me to discuss the products that I really liked to do," said Greenwell to me.
"I think it was relaxing for him; a chance to take a few moments for himself."
Her favorite was the luxury mark Clarins.
Diana has allegedly used day and night cream for their sensitive skins and their alpine herbs and toners.
He also visited the cosmetic Janet Fillerman's central London beauty lounge regularly in facial care.
Diana had famously beautiful skin, but sometimes she had roses, moderate urticaria, which is often due to stress.
To mitigate it, he used natural sedative oils, including squirrel oil.
"Diana had a wonderful bone structure," said Greenwell.
The only part of his appearance that he wasn't very confident about was his nose.
Anna Harvey recalls: "One time, when the newspapers wrote that she had been in the nose for a beauty operation, she turned to me and laughed, "Really, if I had let my nose operate, do you think I'd have chosen this kind of thing?"
When Mary Greenwell and Sam McKnight’s advice began to occupy, Diana felt increasingly confident about her new appearance.
One of his most memorable public interventions - in the Serpentine Gallery in London in 1994, where he wore the famous "hand tax dress" exhibiting a figure highlighting Christina Stambolian - shows that the signature style of the end of his life began to develop.
With short hair combed over the ears, Diana is simultaneously sexy and dynamic, with her short hair in sharp contrast with a very challenging black silk dress.
His makeup is perfect - flattering, but at the same time modest, black eyeliner highlighting his eyes blueness.
In fear of bright colors, especially red, he wore a shiny red candle, probably Revlon Red, which then became a trademark in some ways.
A few months later, he blew up his elegant red manicure in a child loss fund in the Royal Nursing College.
The princess was the basis for health and self-confidence.
And finally he had full control.
Dayd and shaped, his makeless, he conveys exactly what he wants the viewers to think: here is a woman who finally seems to have a sense of self-consciousness and a purpose in life, and who has finally, after just 36, has found her place.
It's really a shame he couldn't prove it to himself.
South-East-Japan prepares for taifoon Noru
A large part of Southwest Japan, including the areas that were destroyed last month, was prepared for even more rain on Friday than Tifoon Noru, which was one of the strongest storms in the world this year, was moving closer to the main islands of the country.
According to the Meteorology Department, there are strong winds and abundant rains on Friday’s southwestern Kyushu and about 1350 km south of Tokyo, and it is possible for the next 48 hours to rain up to 800 mm.
A representative of the Meteorology Department said that Noru, which marks a certain type of herd in Korean, will then probably turn north and dew with rain over Kyushu, although the northern parts of the island, which were hit by rainings and floods last month, which killed 36 people and left four lost, are likely to escape the worst.
"This is a very slowly moving storm," he added, stating that this is why there is a higher flood risk, because in one region it rains over a longer period of time.
Noru, which at one point was a category 5 taifoon and is an unusually long-age storm, formed first two weeks ago and wandered through a circle across the northern Pacific before heading northwest, targeting Japan and weakening his approach.
The representative added that, depending on the change of course, Noru may move directly across Kyushu and then along the Japanese island of Honshu, but it is still difficult to identify a long-term journey.
There are places in the landscape where, if necessary, normal vehicles can't just get away with the best want.
There's the ATV solution.
The ATVs that are in use in the militia area gave an overview of Protective Home!
The use of such lightweight and high-performance vehicles in militia structures is not new.
The need for them has already emerged during World War II, but a tenth later, greater attention began to be given to them.
Simplity and strength
In 1956, Willys Overland’s factories had already been rolled out by M-274 - development of a vehicle designed for the evacuation of wounded persons during the final years of World War II.
For further development, it is a bit strange to call a mechanical mule to speed up.
It's hard to imagine a more ascetic vehicle.
Rail platform, seat and role: everything, all luxury.
As if the league constructors had hit the drawings too hard from the engineer's desktop and quickly started production.
In war, however, comfort is much more permissible.
There was no objection to the mule tested in the jungles of Vietnam in this category.
Poorly, a light, less than five hundred kilograms weighing machine was able to humiliate in those places where, with its supertransparent ability, Willyse Jeep, a mytologyal famous, had to show the brake lights.
Vehicles with a load of approximately 500 kg were mostly used for transportation, both for the transport of mould and vigorous power.
At other times, the mule was fitted with lighter, non-rebound tanking weapons.
The accident of such a truck under fire, and it still happened, the driver was able to move the steering system upwards in the last trouble and let it so low that the vehicle could be driven in the stomach.
The aliens were produced up to 1970, ready for 11 240, and were used in the army until 1980, when they were replaced against the HMMWVs who had made a race.
In the following two decades, ATVs had rather marginal meaning in militia regions.
They came back to the picture after the twin towers fell into dust in New York, and the US soldiers found themselves dying in the desert landscapes of Iraq and Afghanistan.
That's where the knowledge and understanding were born, that something needed to fill the empty space between Humwee and the infantry.
As ATVs generally do not offer considerably protection, they are not the best choice directly to carry out battle missions.
However, quick and light machines are suitable for specific tasks.
For example, in intelligence and rescue operations.
Today, thousands of ATVs and UTVs are in use in the American army.
Most of them, such as XUV550d, which was acquired to the Defence Union, are essentially similar to those in civilian turnover, but are supplemented according to the needs of the Army.
Names such as Kawasaki Mule, Hondalt Rancher and Foreman, Yamahalt Rhino and Arctic Cat, and Polaris models of the leading militia-ATVde manufacturer, have been represented by the trade marks that have been acquired on the back of the campus.
In 2013, Polaris concluded a five-year agreement with the American Special Forces Centre (SOCOM) for the supply of two-sitting MRZR2 and MRZR4 and a separate five-year agreement on MV850 produced on the basis of Polaris Sportsman, which has both infrared and black-out lights and innovative bees-like tyres that ensure mobility even after the impact of a 50-calibian weapon.
Before MV850 came to the market, Polaris was able to supply vehicles MV700 and MV800 to the military.
MV700 is a military version of the Polaris 700cc Twin Sportsman for civil use, accompanied by wings and backs, a two-part fuel tank for larger distances, a reinforced framework and a basic, and some militia equipment that farmers or whores in the same forest will not be able to do more than do.
As well as the John Deere M-Gators used in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with the Polaris ATVs, it is equipped with armed support, luggage backing, and some other elements that are useless in the wrists, but necessary in the battle zone.
A vehicle weighing 750 kilograms can carry almost its weight section, or, more specifically, 570 kg of stuff.
The power of the engine is also sufficient for the transport of lighter tracks and cannon parts.
The shaped box in the rear part of which the sides can be removed allows for the transport of a B baggage from point A, which is greater than the small but intestine.
Later, M-Gator's supplemented versions A1, which is 20 horsepowers more powerful than the original 20-performance M-Gator, and the subsequent reinforced frame A2, which is even better to carry and tow, and A3, which combines the positive properties of A1 and A2.
In fact, in 1997 and 1998, the M-Gators were already received in Bosnia, where medical brigades used them to evacuate the wounded.
At the same time, they also reduced the load of soldiers moving on their legs, dragging the stuff that would otherwise have to be carried on.
If most of the ATVs in use in power structures are modifications of civil-use vehicles, there are also some exceptions.
The most outstanding of these are the war raids with the name Prowler produced in Phoenix International, which have been successfully used for all possible battle, intelligence and rescue missions worldwide.
According to the manufacturer, for the first time 10 years, for these vehicles designed for the purpose of carrying out specific operations, the bottlenecks which are characterised by conventional ATVs and those which have been modified for the purpose of the Army, have been introduced in the light of both guiding, stamina and safety.
However, while being similar to the normal ATV from the construction and the size of the building, Prowler is completely different in terms of both its design and capacity.
He is faster, more persistent, more stable, and is able to carry and carry more difficulties than other similar vehicles.
For example, if, in the case of a normal ATV, the driver must continue to play with his body position and use both hands to manoeuvre, speed up and brake, then Prowler’s driving is more like driving.
But at the end, it doesn't matter whether Prowler, Gator, MV850 or any other ATV or UTV concept and field of use are similar to that of all.
And it is clear that in circumstances where a wide charge of defence costs is attempted to reduce and a smaller, target-oriented suspicion instead of a large-scale conventional war, lightweight and fast small vehicles have joined the army to stay in service.
Division's prognosis led to the publication of delicate data on vulnerable children in care
As a result of a worrying breach of information, the mother of a child was wrongly sent to the child's personal data, including information on whether they are sexually active.
The mother was sent an e-mail table containing the names, the date of birth, the locations and the specific points of concern and attention of all children in the city of Victoria.
The e-mail revealed the place where each child lived.
The list states that one 13-year-old boy is released against bail and sexual behavior is manifested in his case that one 15-year-old girl with problems with self-injury, abuse and running of certain substances is "with a boyfriend out" and "not returning tonight" and that one 14-year-old boy needs help with "care for herself" and is verbally aggressive and physically threatening.
The table seems to be a transfer document intended to be sent to the night shift supervisor.
The document shall contain notes on when to wait for a child at home or whether they can contact the staff for their arrival.
There have been an alarming number of details for some children.
A 15-year-old boy has been warned: "If the staff contacts to obtain permission to search the room and/or check the laptop/USB device because of the suspicion of inappropriate sexual material, this authorisation shall be granted."
The document also states that a 17-year-old girl who receives only three months after 18 and is released from the care agency is at a risk of suicide attempts so high that, if she escapes, the staff must call the emergency line immediately.
For a 16-year-old parole boy, it was noted that he was out and that he'd contact the staff later to be deceived.
Although only the name of the accommodation unit in which the children are kept and not their addresses are mentioned in the listed locations, the details are sufficient to be found.
The 2015 data sheet came out when her mother shared her experience with Fairfax Media in communication with the Ministry of Health and Service and with child protection four years ago, since she took care of her daughter.
He agreed to share his concerns now that his daughter had become 18 and left the system.
The heartbreaking decision to transfer her daughter to child protection was taken after a violent incident at home. This is one of the more and more complaints of family violence by parents against their children.
For example, her daughter was able to receive seven criminal charges within six months of leaving her home, moved hundreds of miles away to home and to a party where she seemed to succeed, but then moved back without informing her parents, and also accepted and facilitated two relationships between her daughter and her older husband.
The relationship with the first of those boyfriends, the 17-year-olds with whom the nursing authorities at that time allowed a 15-year-old daughter to stay at a local hotel, ended when the young man was accused of having sex with the child a few days after he was 18 years old.
"Why did she leave the system in a worse situation than when she entered?" she asks.
"And does this happen to all the caretaken children?"
He expressly advocates the creation of an institution that would enable the Ministry of Health and Service to monitor children during the first few weeks after they are taken care of before they are moved to their homes.
This would enable them to understand better how children communicate with others, and what risks and their needs, especially in education.
The State Government is looking for new ways to reduce the need to place children in home care, in particular by seeking better support for their parents.
Assistance packages, funded for a period of four years by $62 million, are designed to help to transfer children from home to a better place of care to situations.
In addition, a two-year experiment of $5.6 million, which was published in the previous October, allows professional care providers to at least 28 children to help them get out of custody or prevent them from getting into it.
According to the department's representative, the information leak was not officially reported when this happened, although the mother claims that two department staff were informed within a few months of the incident.
The department is now working with the service provider to analyse the case.
"Every alleged private data leaks are taken very seriously, and we are working to ensure that it has not affected the young people concerned."
In July last year, the Minister of Family and Children, Jenny Mikako, commissioned an independent examination of the sample of child protection incidents during the five-year period.
As a result, the department agreed with the seven recommendations made and has subsequently updated the child protection instructions to ensure that the staff understands clearly the activities related to their roles and privacy, changed IT systems to prohibit the automatic aggregation of certain personal data, and officially reviewed the activities related to the privacy of the department.
The Bank of Australia, Commonwealth Bank, is charged with extensive breaches of money laundering
On Thursday, the Australian Government filed a accusation against the largest hypothesis of the State against the loaner Commonwealth Bank in a broad violation of the rules against money laundering and terrorist financing.
The Financial Intelligence Agency AUTRAC announced that they have initiated a civil sanction procedure against CommBank in the Federal Court of Justice due to the "serious and systematic non-compliance" of Australia's largest personal case and the first where a large bank is charged.
"CommBank's behaviour in this matter has left Australian society unprotected for serious and lasting financial crime," said the AUSTRAC judiciary.
The Commonwealth Bank said in his statement that they were investigating charges more closely and responding, "if time is right."
Australia's largest hypothek lender did not report "in the right time or at all" any suspicious facts, "which relate to transactions in a total of more than 77 million Australian dollars ($61 million USD)," reported AUSTRAC.
According to the Agency, the Bank has committed 53 700 infringements of anti-money laundering and terrorist financing acts, in particular as regards intelligent input machines.
The previous largest such type of case was involved earlier this year with the most popular engagement intermediary in Australia, Tabcorp Holdings, who had only 108 alleged violations.
Tabcorp paid $45 million of Australian fines and is the greatest civil punishment in Australia’s corporate history.
A representative of the USTRAC refused to comment on the possible penalty of CommBank or whether other banks could be on the Agency’s fireline.
The maximum penalty in the event of a breach of the law against money laundering and terrorist financing is EUR 18 million for an infringement of Australian dollars.
Intelligent payment machines are a certain type of banking machines that accept contributions both in the form of cash and in the form of a check and facilitate anonymous cash contributions.
According to the USTRAC, the use of CommBank's intelligent input machines has increased considerably since their introduction in May 2012.
In the six months preceding June 2016, cash contributions amounted to 5.8 billion Australian dollars compared to $89 million Australian dollars in the first six months after the CommBank introduced the automatics.
The USTRAC argues in court documents that cash contributions were made under false names so that the income was received from the syndicates importing drugs.
"Selfs after CommBank was given attention to suspected money laundering or smurfing in Commbank's accounts, CommBank did not start to monitor his clients to aggravate and manage money laundering and terrorist financing," the judicial documents indicate.
The USTRAC added that CommBank accounts were also used for "murdering", a form of money laundering involving transfers between countries without the money being actually crossing international borders.
Nordea and DNB will become a reality at the end of the year
The merger of the DNB and the Baltic departments of Nordea will only be effected in the last quarter of this year, writing Business Day.
The opening of doors in the common legal body has been increasingly delayed.
Following the publication of the accession plans in the summer, the banks indicated that the completion of the transaction could remain in the second quarter.
But in April, the DNB Communication Manager said that it would be delayed to the third quarter.
In particular, the Swedish Financial Inspection provided Luminor with additional instructions to comply with the regional importance of the combined bank.
Trump called New Hampshire the "narcourka", making it angry for state politicians.
"The President is wrong," said the New Hampshire Republican Governor Chris Sununu.
It disappoints me that his misunderstanding of the epidemic ignores everything that the state has to offer.
Senator Maggie Hassan, New Hampshire's Democrat, called comments "explainable" and said on Twitter that his state is no different from the others who fight the misuse of opioids.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, as well as the Democrat, agreed.
"It's totally unacceptable that the president talks about NH in this way," he wrote on Twitter.
It's a complete misconception of the NH and the epidemic.
Opioid addiction - a category of drugs that consists of heroin and fentanyl - is the most lethal drug epidemic in American history.
The overdose of drugs killed more people in 2016 than weapons or car accidents - estimated 59 000 people, analysed in The New York Times - and now the main cause of death for Americans under 50 years of age.
In 2015, more than 97 million people in the United States consumed receptive painkillers, according to the Agency for Material abuse and mental health.
It is estimated that 12 million of these people did so in a way that had not been appointed by the doctor.
New Hampshire has received a hard blow and its inhabitants raised the problem repeatedly to the presidential candidates during the 2016 campaign.
New Hampshire is estimated to be 470 deaths due to overdose in 2016 compared to 439 cases in 2015.
In 2012, they were reported by New Hampshire i Ministry of Health and Service in 163.
On Thursday, Sununu described the opioid epidemic in an e-mail as "one of the worst health crisis the state has ever faced".
He said that the government has doubled the resources dedicated to prevention, treatment and recovery.
According to him, the state has also spent millions of dollars on preventive programmes for children, law enforcement for the closure of drug trafficking and initiatives aimed at making the naroxone available for overdose.

We want to know what was said during this conversation, and the manager may also know important details that would help us study."
According to the police, the driver of another vehicle, who was described as red VW Sharan, would probably have taken the victim home after the second time he was raped.

Why do dogs chew grass?
Sometimes they think a dog eats medication when he doesn't feel well and wants to throw himself up.
In fact, most herbal dogs are completely healthy.
Only less than 10 percent of dogs who chew grass do this because of some disease.
One reason why a dog can suddenly eat grass may be a nutrient-deficient food table.
Even dogs with worms may become more interested in chewing grass.
Thus, if a dog who has never chewed grass has a sudden appetite after grass and eats it often, it is worth checking to see a doctor in case that, for example, the potential problem of digestive organs can be quickly traced.
It is worth mentioning that a dog may also eat grass because he likes this taste or is just boring.
If a health problem is excluded, it is worth checking that the family’s favourite still receives sufficient development and moody activities.

But the Greater Thunderstorm boasts south-eastern Finland and Russia, east of St. Petersburg.
Fortunately, the winds in Estonia blow from the west and the southwest, which at least does not threaten the major storms to return to Estonia.
Sylvester Stallone's coming up in a hostage in the series "Our Life" in the second season
The leading producer Dan Fogelman announced on Thursday, within the framework of the Television Critics Association’s pressure forum that NBC’s popular drama series in the foreseeable second season will step up Sylvester Stallone.
As a guest, an actor steps up the role of Kevin (Justin Hartley) in film film films at the beginning of the season.
"Kevin plays in a big movie and we needed a big fellow," said Fogelman.
At the end of the last season, Kevin was hired to play an important role in a film framed by Ron Howard.
In this season, we will see how the character participates in the project and also warms up relations with the ex-bodied by Alexandra Breckenridge.
According to Fogelman, Stallone's playing in the movie Kevin's part is a father figure.
The "Our Life" star Milo Ventimiglia, who plays a series in the past, Hartley's father, played as a coincidence in the 2006 film "Rocky Balboa" Stallone's son.
Fogelman said Ventimiglia's still blossoming friendship with Stallone was probably what helped the show to attract a large star as a guest actor.
"We have a great scenario for him.
I think it's gonna be really exciting," said Fogelman.
"Our life" returns to the TV screen on September 26.
Two elite school workers were arrested in the United States after a national hunt.
The 42-year-old Northwestern professor Wyndham Lathem turned himself up to the police in California after the police were looking for him.
Andrew Warren, a 56-year-old at Oxford University, got the police in San Francisco.
Men are suspected of the brutal stabbing of the 26-year-old Trenton Cornell-Duranleau.
He was found dead at Lathem's apartment in Chicago at the end of the month.
A few days later, suspects made a huge contribution to a library in cash under the name of the dead.
Before handing himself to the police, Latham sent one of the Chicago police officers to friends and family members a video of the biggest mistake of life.
CNN didn't see the video, and the police don't.
According to the police, it was a cruel murder and his body was transformed as a result of wounds.
Warren had recently arrived from Britain to Chicago, but researchers have not yet established whether and how he was familiar with the victim.
Before arrest, both suspects escaped the state.
Elise Christie talks about how she got over the horrors and cyber jaws of Soch to re-sleep in the name of gold.
Compared to this fragile young woman who recently considered a good-bye with the hysterian for ever, the 26-year-old Christie has changed to the unknown.
He was intimidated by the bad insults, especially because he was reprimanded when he was a child in West Lothian.
At present, he packs himself and believes that the trial can return to the beginning point by bringing at least one gold in Pyeongchang with him.
"I wish to leave without doubt as an Olympic winner," he says, without fearing the purpose of clarifying.
"I feel I'm both physically and mentally in the right place to do this."
He once dreamed of a career in the octopus until the aesthetic elements began to reduce this interest.
"I was a very good jumper, but I had trouble with the artistic side," he said laughing.
"I wasn't very good at elegantity, regularity.
It was a reasonable choice, because short-ranging is best suited to my personality."
A woman walks around the world: my daily budget is $5!
To honor the truth, I have also had this experience, indeed, for 40 days, in South France, I decided to live a life of "great" so that I could just be free and live the day at once.
It was found in the overnight tent, forest, small town stations, etc.
In the second week, I joined a Frenchman, a homeless man, 44 years old, was...
Oh, don't think that some kind of scams or other: We just spent the night in the same park in Mentons and became friends, even though he was 15a older than me, he was a good company.
Turns out he's a good family from Paris, a former French Navy officer.
You don't eat alcohol, you don't do it, you're just a decent person, intelligent, pleasant communicationsman, you see life.
In a word-- I joined him, and the next three weeks we traveled together, from town to city, and also about $5 per day for food money.
There's a lot of money, so you can't live.
The man taught how to offer help at the terraces and farms of closed hotels and restaurants.
We did exactly that much work so that it would be 2-3 days for food money and then...
At some point, I had a fever, and I decided I couldn't...
I took a flight to Helsinki, from there to home.
And by the way, I still regret it.
These 40 days must have been the best in my life.
In Indonesia, a man who stole three sound amplifiers from the moskee was burned alive by the Hungarian news agency MTI.
A thirty - year - old thief sneaked out of the moskee city near the capital of Jakarta on August 1, but the sanctuary guard spotted him and shouted: "Take the thief!"
They came to help, and they started tracking the thief.
That one escaped on a motorcycle and swim even across the river.
The chase lasted a few miles, then one of the chasers threw a stone to the head, causing serious injury.
The raging chase caught a thief and beat him down.
A chaperone poured a thief over petrol and set him on fire.
The innocent died of burning wounds at the scene.
The body was transported to the police hospital in East Jakarta.
The police took over both the dead motorcycle and the stolen sound amplifiers.
In the local press, reports initially appeared as if it were not a thief, but an electric monteur who wanted to repair the sound power.
However, the police rebeled these claims decisively.
The people of the deceased reported that they did not make a statement on what happened.
According to the German news agency dpa, this step is due to the fact that Indonesians do not particularly trust police or judicial authorities.
Indonesia is the largest Islamic country in the world.
Among the 255 million inhabitants, the Muslims are up to 87.2%.
Australian kitchen: a finger covering to a school garden.
From the indigenous peoples of abortions, the Australian kitchen has inherited fingertips and cangaroo meat.
The British roots have also had a great impact on the table there, such as Vegemite, the dark brown salt beer barley, which is spoiled with the butter on the loaf or the creator, reminds the British Marmite.
Meat pies, or sausages, are also made of British meatberries with cooking potatoes and sauce.
Also, the UK originates BBQ Snags, or raw sausages, which are cooked by Australians on a barbecue, but the British rather in a furnace.
One of the local sweeteners is Pavlova beseetort, although it is also called their invention by the New Zealanders.
The sweets are still loved with coconut and oat flakes of Anzac biscuits and coconut chocolate coconuts of lamington.
Honey Joys, or the fun of a frog, they call honey-flop balls.

In the autumn of this year, Stephanie marks her 77th birthday.
His father was a state official and Mother Mary loved very much food.
Stephanie studied bibliotheek at the university and, as Australian youths, as far as possible, went to discover Europe after her studies.
While traveling to France, Stephanie’s love for food was only occupied and developed.
In London, however, he met his first husband, Monty, Jamaica’s roots, who, when they returned to Australia, opened the Jamaican House in Melbourne in 1964.
About ten years later, marriage broke out, and the restaurant closed the doors.
In 1976 he opened a restaurant in Stephanie's Restaurant for a more wealthy public, which was one of the most appreciated restaurants in Melbourne for the next 21 years.
An important restaurant is still mentioned as the first fine dining restaurant in Melbourne, which really was able to value fresh raw materials and offered seasonal food - a fact that now seems to be the case, but it was not yet at the end of the previous century.
After retreating from the restaurant business in 1997, Stephanie has focused on writing cookbooks, which have appeared 15 in her feathers.
Although there are more productive food writers in Estonia, no book has just been a recipe set.
For Australian home cooks, different Stephanie Alexander's cook books have been unpreparable.
But for his life, the lady considers the fifth cook book, the super-fashioned "The Cook's Companion", which is now at least half a million Australian home.
The book was published for the first time in 1996, supplemented in 2004 and the latest version in 2014.
In my book wrapping, this 2004 edition takes quite a lot of room, as the impressive book contains about a thousand recipes on 1126 pages!
However, the latest option is even wider.

This is a real cooking bible, which, in addition to recipes, deals with the purchase and storage of different raw materials, presents food cooking technologies and recommends the purchase of kitchen appliances.
The foods are alphabetically in order, and there are also many cross references in the paper - obviously the bibliotheek education did not run down the sides of the food writer.
Stephanie himself stressed that this book changed her life and gave her a new direction for the future.
The feeling of popularity in the book that he has something to give to people has led to the next large kitchen garden project that is comparable to school gardens in our circumstances.
The fourth person in Estonia had a heart in Finland.
The post-operative period has been expected to have passed as expected by doctors, cardiocrirgin Günter Talal and cardiolog Pentti Põdra, who participated in the surgery with Finnish medical practitioners.
"It's hard to say how long the patient could have lived without a new heart," said Põder.
According to the doctors, the world has now lived with a heart pump for up to eight years.
The man himself recovers and is not ready to talk about it.
He was diagnosed with heart failure for the first two years ago, and the disease had already reached the final stage, heart failure was caused by ischaemic disease.
"For this patient, transplant was the only option," added Talal.
According to Cardiocrirurg, after transplant, the patient has no more batteries or wires accompanying the heart pump.
He's only got a scar and a medication that deterrents his immunity.
The patient can make sports and generally live as a normal person," he said.
First year is the most dangerous.
In addition, it takes three to six months to fully recover.
Both doctors say that the patient should be closely monitored regularly for medication, while the medicines also have side effects.
In addition, the patient should be inspected in order to avoid rejection of the donor body.
The most dangerous is the first year, but according to ISHLT, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, 50 percent of patients are already living for over ten years.
In Helsinki, the results are better and the longest one has been transferred with a heart of 25 years.
The cardiocular surgeon explained that because of the disease the patient’s poor blood circulation, a heart pump was placed a year ago, which helped to recover for surgery.
When the pulmonary artery pressure fell, he became a suitable candidate for transplant.
The transfer operation is not considered to be a very difficult surgery: the right timing is very important.
"It took a lot more time to get the pump and then get the heart when put in a new heart," he said.
In addition, cardiocular surgeon pointed out the release from the outer bloodstream as a complex part of the operation.
Rather, he said that cardiac transplants could be considered unusual because it is the least needed by Estonians.
No more kidney, liver and lung transplants are carried out.
The rare surgery still involves excitement, but we have been practicing this work for many years.
Learning to know yourself and your nervous system is one of the art in this profession," added Talal.
The organ needs four more people.
The Talal claims that the patient had a heart rate because the organ was not suitable for any other patients living in the Scandia Transpland Community.
Scandiatransplant is a organisation of organisational exchanges with members of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia.
There are currently four more people on the list of heart transplants in Estonia.
"They're still read patients," emphasised Põder.
Taal says the heart is the longest waiting for big men with a 0-positive blood group.
"Fine is about a half years in order for it," he said.
There are also conditions for abundance of heart.
"Normally, the heart of a woman is not suitable for a man, the heart of a great man is small and so on," he listed the cardiocra.
How to finance company vehicles?
In a changed consumption society, the opportunities for financing vehicles for enlarged companies are increasing, alongside normal practice, companies are also using a full service leasing or a more obligatory long-term automobile.
Leasing and renting a vehicle are two clearly different financial transactions involving various commitments and expectations, but often confusing.
According to Villi Tõldi, the Estonian head of sales and marketing of the international autonomous company AVIS, it is estimated that companies are increasingly moving towards a full service leasing and also increasingly using long-term rental opportunities.
The interpreter pointed out the main questions for which it is possible to choose a suitable way of using a vehicle.
How long to use the vehicle?
The largest difference in car rental and leasing is the time of use.
"Lising should be preferred for the longer-term use of a vehicle if the company has plans to take business vehicles for a longer period of time", the Teacher explained, adding that it is worth making a decision if a vehicle is to be owned, a full service leasing or a long-term rental if the vehicle is intended to be used as a service, i.e. a daily vehicle, but leaving maintenance obligations on the service provider and leaving the property.
"The passenger car has a much shorter use period than the leasing period, but many major car rental companies also offer a long-term automobile, where car rental takes place without complex contracts and free guarantee," the Telega introduced a variety of possibilities for renting cars.
Who's gonna be the owner of the vehicle?
At the end of the fee, the rental will become the owner of the car.
"In the case of full leasing, it is possible, at the end of the leasing period, to continue with the leasing payment under the same or better conditions, to replace an equivalent new vehicle that meets the needs of the company", he said, stressing that, since the consumption society is increasingly moving towards a service-centred consumption, the ownership of the vehicle is an additional obligation for the company.
In addition, in the case of a full service leasing, it is possible to buy a car on the basis of a request and agreed terms.
However, the possibility of renting is not available and is paid only for the period of use.
Car rental is usually carried out in car companies’ offices and car rental from the rental office of rental companies.
Automotive representations are primarily involved in the sale of vehicles, but they also offer the possibility of leasing and, in some cases, the automobile.
Renting companies, however, have cars for their sole purpose to rent them out.
The translation said that the reasons for the use of the rental service are different - many companies rent occupational vehicles, in addition, it is convenient to use the service in order or on holiday, or if their own car is repaired.
"Auxiliary vehicles are increasingly shifted to a full service leasing which provides the customer with transparency of costs, time savings in the purchasing, use and return of vehicles and greater comfort," the sales and marketing manager presented the growing leasing trend.
Each year, more and more companies use full service leasing for their car park, thereby optimising their costs and focusing on their main business.
What is the service-based insurance coverage?
If a leasing car is compulsory for cash and road insurance, the rental car is usually covered by basic insurance, and it is also necessary to decide whether to add, for example, accident insurance, thief insurance or full insurance. "If compared with a normal leasing with a full service leasing, the customer will receive more on an equivalent monthly fee, since, in addition to the vehicle and insurance, the monthly payment will also be covered by regular car care, day-to-day assistance, tyre change and other agreed services," Tõld explained.
"If any new vehicle can be taken into normal leasing, the service provider will help the company to choose a vehicle corresponding to the wishes and needs of the company, which also takes account of the functionality of the operation," he compared, stressing that full service leasing will certainly help to optimise the costs of the company’s car parks.
"The choice of passenger vehicles depends on the rental car park of the service provider - different rental companies offer small and economic vehicles in their vehicle park for urban traffic and also the luxury sedan for business meetings," Tõld described.
Of course, during a tight rental period, the desired car may already be rented, but early booking of the desired vehicle will help.
If you choose between leasing or renting, you should first clarify your objectives - how long you want to use the vehicle and which are long-term plans for the car.
Surely it is also worth a careful look at the different conditions and obligations for services.
At a press conference last night, Olga Ivanova, a member of the Council of Elections of Edgar Savisaare, said that the Saviaar Election Union offers the Central Region a full competition in the autumn elections in Tallinn.
How likely is Edgar Savisaar, however, to evaluate the cooperation of Urmas Sirärumaa electoral union "Autus Tallinn"?
The U.S. Navy veteran was ordered to remove the American flag from the mailbox
The difference between the United States veteran and Florida's homeowners' union is at the heart of a twisted dispute with the American flag.
Erus John Ackert, an officer of the United States Navy, says that he received a letter from the Association of the Southwood House of Tallahassee last week, in which he is asked to remove or face punishment from the mailbox in the carpet representing the flag of the state.
He told the toilet that he was not going to give up without a fight and has appealed.
"I think of that, frankly, as a bully," said Ackert.
And I think people should fight any form of bullying, especially that.
Ackert said that the Union of homeowners argued that its mailbox is not in line with the aesthetic values of Southwood.
John Ackert, a veterinarian of the United States, said that he was told to remove the American flag covering his mailbox.
"We ask you to remove the American flag cap from the mailbox because of the approach to the end of the season," forwarded the letter.
Penalties may be outside 30 days before and must be withdrawn within 15 days at the latest.
He said he's been out there for four years.
It had to put it there 30 days after I moved into the house.
Words to the Southwood House Association were not received immediately on Thursday morning.
Some of the neighbors of Ackert told the WCTV that the letter was a little rough, and they were not particularly surprised by the activities of the Union of homeowners.
"They do these things all the time," said Mike Stephenson.
I think it's ridiculous.
Why can't you be patriotic in your own country?
Mike Patel said, "This is a veteran who served our country.
It's just a flag mailbox.
I don't think it's right.
The house belongs to him, at least that could be allowed.
The letter of the Union of homeowners says Acker has 15 days to remove the carpet, otherwise he's got a fine.
He has not received an answer to his appeal.
Vietnam " feels sorry" for the German kidnapping of people
On Thursday, Vietnam said that he regretted the comments of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs who accused the Vietnam intelligence service of the former Vietnamese oil company, who is being pursued in the home country because of the acquisition charges.
The German authorities believe that Trinh Xuan Thanh was taken from Berlin, which left Vietnam on Wednesday 48 hours to leave the country.
Thanh is facing charges of innocence with a death penalty in case of prosecution.
He was looking for an asyl in Germany, but his statement had not yet been completed when the Vietnamese authorities demanded his release.
Mr Le Thi Thu Hang, a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam, said to the reporters that these comments were "remarkably regrettable" and Thanh himself turned himself up to the police on 31 July in Vietnam.
"Vietnam always considers it important and wishes to develop strategic relations with Germany," he said without falling into details.
Thanh, 51, disappeared in July last year after the original suspicion of unfair management in the national petroleum and gas gigantic PetroVietnam subsidiary, which led to losses of about USD 150 million.
The Vietnam Police issued an arrest order in September.
In March, a police investigation was initiated to investigate the acquisition of its alleged involvement in the real estate development project.
Thanh was chairman of PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation until 2013, when he was appointed to several senior positions in the government, including the vice-chairman of the Hau Giang Province in Mekong Delta in the south.
He was elected to the National Assembly in May 2016, but was released from the Communist supervised legislative body prior to its first meeting.
He was also thrown out of a communist party.
The Vietnamese Ambassador, Germany, was invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday and was informed that Germany would require the return of Thanh so that the asyl and extradition procedures could be properly implemented.
The driver saved eight puppies from the road, not knowing that the dogs actually have the owner.
"Where I put these eight puppies, I would have been thrown out by a woman with dogs from the apartment," laughed by bus driver Oleg, who saved the dog dogs who had been screwed out of control on the road, giving them to a shelter worker.
Soon, however, the owner of the dogs, for whom he lost his understanding of why the puppies were taken away from his home.
The bus driver Oleg of Harjumaa said that he has already worked as a bus driver since the early 1990s, but this case has not been before during his career."I traveled with bus number 146 on my usual route.
Near Harju-Rist, I noticed that there was something small running around the road.
I thought it was a wreck, but it turns out it was four puppies," reminded the bus driver.
Oleg had a heartbeat, and he stopped passengers on a bus full of puppies to pick up the puppies.
"Sorry started, cars would've driven over them, and the dogs were crushed," said Oleg.
He added that the passengers were reasonable and that soft dogs also offered them great joy.
The puppies were a little scared at first, but then they got fun.
The puppies on board, the bus driver went into a new circle because the schedule needed to be followed.
On his way to the place where the puppies were found again, he saw four other little dogs there.
It was a German sheephound with puppies.
They were so quick, and immediately they had been taken care of.
The dogs were beautiful. They were astonishing.
The first thought, of course, was that someone wanted to get rid of them for some reason," said the bus driver, “that is why he decided to carry the puppies on the bus.
"I took those four puppies and called the police," recalled Oleg.
Orders contacted Tallinn Animal Asylum, the worker came to the puppies in the Baltic Station.
But did the bus driver not have the temptation to take the hair balls?
That was the idea.
One of the dog boys was so beautiful and calm.
She sat nicely like a grown-up dog," said Oleg.
But where do I put these eight puppies?
I would have been thrown out by a woman with dogs.
We still have a little kid.
It's too early to take the dog," he added.
Eve Tobias, the head of Tallinn Animal Asylum, confirmed that 8 German sheep dogs were brought to the shelter, two and a half months old.
But on the same day, the owner came after the puppy family.
"We didn't even shape these puppies in and gave them back just like that," he said.
"The dog owner was not very upset, but he said that they had the only house in sight, and the bus driver could have asked if the puppies belonged to them," said Tobias.
However, the shelter manager added that it is good, however, that the bus driver picked up the peppers on the road and therefore did not happen to them.
In fact, it was very good for the bus driver to react!
The Jordan Court enforced the life sentence for the murder of three US military soldiers
The Jordan military Appeal Court sentenced the Jordanian soldier last year for the shooting of three military trainers in the United States.
Last month, the war tribunal appointed senior sergeant Marik al-Tuwayhale at the South-Jordan Air Base for killing Americans for life-long prison sentence with hard work.
Al-Tuwayha opened fire on the American caravan, claiming that he was afraid of an attack on the base.
After the decision, however, the video of security cameras published showed that he continued to shoot even when two Americans shielded and sneaked with their hands to stop shooting.
On Thursday, Hala Akhbar, related to the Jordanian army, announced that the military appeal court with five judges confirmed the sentence of Al-Tuwayha.
James Harrison spends about $300,000 a year to keep his body in play form
Every NFL player depends on his body to earn a living.
Hence, many other attractions also invest a lot of money in caring and restoring the body in order to stay in the top form.
Jeremy Fowler from the ESPN.com portal investigated how far some veterans are ready to go to extend their career.
None of the cases, however, are as extreme as James Harrison, 39 years old, the player on the back line of Pittsburgh Steelers, preparing for the 14th season.
According to Fowler, Harrison spends $300 000 a year on the middle of the year for needle treatment, massage therapy, chiropractors and cafes.
Most of the costs are related to travelling across the country to meet specialists.
"I don't have to account for such things," said Harrison.
"If you compare the amounts earned with my expenses, the payments are worth it, given how I feel."
Mike Mitchell, Harrison's training partner and teammate in Steelersis, estimated the annual amount of $20,000 to care for his body.
The 30-year-old Mitchell has tested the relaxation of the body (in English "body tempering"), described by Fowler as "the use of 55 kg metal as a massage roll".
"And instead of rolling on it, it's rolled on you," Mitchell said.
"If you have a tense place on your feet and they start moving this thing around, it hurts sometimes.
But when you get up, the tension's gone.
It's just kicking out the tension."
They're ready to make extra efforts, but former NFL players Barry Cofield and Ryan Harris spend $50,000 a year to recover.
Cofield, who played 10 seasons in New York Giants and Washington Redskins, has expressed his regret that he didn't spend more.
"If I could go back, I'd invest even more," said Cofield Fowler.
"I'd probably like to hear at least twice as much.
I was in good health for the first eight years of my career.
"Maybe more procedures would have been helpful to the end."
Ryan Shazier, a 24-year-old player on the back line, expressed his willingness to follow his veteran teammates from Stelers.
"If you pay $10,000 and earn by playing additional three million, this decision is quite simple," said Shazier.
As far as the long-term career is concerned, investing in the recovery of players is much smarter than spending money on cars and villa.
The average NFL player is lucky if he can play longer than 30 years old, the more Harrison's success should convince his colleagues to pay their expenses to another place.
But maybe they can just find some local specialists.
Weekend Balticu's boss Gunnar Viese tells the Evening Leaf that the festival received from Finland years ago, and its owners went to the beach line to expand, and on the way back, they took a stop to Pärnu, and so the festival was sold to Estonia.
Gunnar says that they have taken 25 000 visitors a day, but the chicks are only read when the festival is completed.
The preparation for the party for this year began in September.
"We had information from the city that the last site began building, there comes a hotel," says Gunnar, with what change they had to face this year.
Now you can't see any bells there, but it's assumed that if the knock didn't go down this year, the next one will go.
So maybe we should have moved out of there sometime," she explains why the festival has moved this year.
The festival arrangements will take place for them over a year.
People work between a thousand and a half thousand on Weekend, policemen, command teams, volunteers, traders, security teams, and so on.
Viise said the hardest was to perform to the Weekend to get the duot The Chainsmokers.
There's no question about men in the pop music world right now.
Why the Chainsmokers were hard to get to the Weekend was and how Gunnar commented on the fact that two artists canceled their performances, look at the video.
In response to Ansip, we have done a great deal for Estonia's success.
Andrus Ansip, Vice-President of the European Commission, said to the Chronics that it was sad to see Estonia's daily policy because the government of Jüri Ratas has turned the head of a simple and predictable tax system.
In the magazine Chronics, you used the opportunity to ask me what I have done for Estonia's success and what I can be proud of.
I am delighted that we have been a good team in the government and have made many important decisions within the months we have read, many of which have been expected in Estonia for more than ten years," wrote Ratas today in social media.
According to Ratas, these decisions are, for example, an income tax reform to raise people's incomes, a pension reform to ensure a worthy retirement age for the elderly, a government reform to balance the development of Estonia, an increase in agricultural subsidies for rural recovery and, of course, healthcare reform for available and high-quality medical care.
"I wish you a good vacation!" wrote Ratas in calling to Ansip.
Talents on Pärnu Weekend: a drunk man climbed into a strange car to sleep
Last night at three o'clock, the police got a bit of a different challenge.
One of Audi's owners reported that in a tank at Port Artur's, a strange man climbed into his car and fell asleep.
A patrol responding to the event found a man who, when the order defenders arrived, became awake.
For a moment, the man was tired on his journey and found a place in the back seat of a stranger’s car.
"The man started on his own way home after the wake of the record guards again," describes the West Prefecture on Facebook.

The stupidest questions to ask the bartender.
Huffington Post deals with the bartenders' ears that they would rather not hear.
What kind of drink do you do best?
Indeed, some drinks have more ingredients than the other, but the same skills and fertility are needed to produce them.
Bar service providers often interpret this question as "What is the easiest thing you have to make now?", giving them a sign that the customer has whatever he drinks, whether it is difficult for a barman or not.
What kind of drink do you like to make?
This question is also interpreted so that what cocktail would be the easiest thing to get from the bartender right now.
It's not the barkeeper's thing to say, but the client's making his own decisions according to the thickness of his wallet.
Rather, barkeepers would expect the question of whether there are any special offers at the moment.
What's the good offer here?
Perhaps it is a purely hearty desire to know if the bar is different from any offer, but it can be asked otherwise.
Nor can a bartender predict what the customer would prefer at all.
Can I have a drink that's not very sweet?
Here, like the previous rule, is that the bartender is not familiar with your taste and preferences, and which is sweet for one, may not be for others.
However, he is ready to listen to the tastes of the cocktail that he recommends.
Does this drink give me headaches/boss?
Barkeeper is not a medic or a predictor, so he can afford it to his client, hand on his heart.
The cold summer has driven Estonians to travel abroad so much that the package travels are not just expensive but are sold, regardless of the price.
Even cheap air tickets and last-minute tickets would not be worth it, but it would be better to think about next year’s travel schedules.
The man hostaged the model to sell him in the dark water.
In Italy, a Polish citizen took a hostage to the UK model.
The man planned to put a 20 - year - old woman in a dark web, or encrypted online auction, reported Guardian.
According to the police, the woman was attracted to Milan by July 11, with a promise that she would get a job at a photo session.
Instead, he was drugged and taken to a villa near Turin.
They claimed that the inmates tried to sell a woman for 230 000 pounds in a dark web and made a ransom claim to his model agency.
However, the woman's imprisoner took her to the British Consulate on July 17th.
According to the police, the suspect is a Polish citizen of Lukas Herba, who lives in Britain.
According to Corriere della Sera, the man discovered that the kidnapped woman had a little child and did not want to sell her as a sex slave.
Such tests attract people.
It would be good if we were to continue to think and conclude.
The recommendation to spend a little more time as a friend to study the background of the applicants is obvious.
More generally, however, everyone could have the strategy that he shares on himself in social media.
At national level, however, it is necessary to ask whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the threats posed in social media.
The lifetime of the werewolves created under controlled conditions ended with summer school, but certainly not with the indigenous.
Sometimes you still have to go to the woods for whatever reason.
However, when cooling between the skin, it is time to make a hot tea drink.
There are enough resources in the woods to do that.
Protecting home! making a small overview.
We are talking about tea beverages because coffee and real tea contain caffeine, which is, however, somewhat refreshing, but is not the best for our health.
With the use of plants found in free nature, it is always necessary to be ready for testing because both recipes and tastes are different.
Some plants don't have to cook long enough, so it's only enough to spill hot water, while others need to be left for hours.
Of course, it must also be careful that water and plants are clean enough.
It also depends much on the season and place of harvesting.
Let us now consider how to make a simple tea drink and how they can affect us.
Pine crochet
Mansion coats can drink peacefully throughout the year.
If it's good to drink 2 litres of water a day, it's a good way to also satisfy the need for vitamin C and to provide some additional energy.
As for all plants, it is possible to obtain useful elements from pine trees using alternative methods, for example, by breaking up the oks - not long to cook, it is enough to boil with hot water and to draw for a few hours.
Half a liter of water takes 0.4 litres of oaks to be cooked for 15 minutes.
The result is a drink containing approximately 25 mg vitamin C, a lot of potassium and zinc.
In addition, the drink contains about 1.5 sugar cubes’ section, or ca 20 kcal sugar.
Cinnamon and honey can always be added to pineapples to improve the taste.
And when the drink gets ugly stiff, it can be diluted with water as a syrup.
It's the same way to make a cucumber, but it tastes a little different.
Raspberry is great and helps with a lot of trouble, from rheumatoid to tavern.
The beacon helps to overcome fatigue, is painful and helps both to relieve the cough and reduce fever in the case of cold diseases.
Consequently, it would not be worth more than half a litre a day to drink.
Grapefruit also causes sweating, so in winter a calmer moment should be found to enjoy it.
Take fresh strawberries for drinking in the winter, use leaves, sprouts or berries during summer.
For a half-liter drink, a small bundle of timber is needed, which must be cooked until the water acquires a red tone.
You can also make a image of the larvae.
To do that, crush your ties and keep them in warm water for a couple of hours.
Longer and more thorough treatment also makes the drink stronger.
Prepared beverages can also be added to pineapples for taste.
Black peaches
The blackhead is a carpenter that in nature looks like a piece of black burnt on a tree.
Mostly, it is found on decks, but also elsewhere.
The use of fungus is very wide - hot drinks, lighting fires, instead of riots, etc.
You can wash yourself very well with ashes.
Black cows are a kind of super drink that can be used to treat a large number of diseases, even cancer, or to relieve, raise tones, reduce stress, increase the life expectancy.
The mushroom contains several unique compounds and many vitamins B, as well as antioxidants and some minerals and proteins.
You can drink any fungus tea every day, and there is no risk of over consumption.
For a drink, about 3 x 3 cm must be cooked in 2-3 litres of water for 5-15 minutes.
Prime Minister Jüri Ratas today visited Estonia's fourth largest island Vorms in the context of a small island circular, where he met local authorities and residents to discuss current issues of island life.
The Vorms Island circulating began at the port of Sviby, where Prime Minister Rata was welcomed by Tanel Viks, Premier of Vorms, and Ivo Sarapuu, Chairman of the municipal council.
The first visit was to the historical Church of St. Olavi and to the adjacent cemetery, which is unique in Estonia in terms of the ring crosses of its pavement and sandstone.
A visit to the Vorms Children's School was followed, where Director Age Hälvin spoke to the Prime Minister about the life situation of the school and the curriculum that would be part of the school students in distant education.
In the morning, the Prime Minister drew up a new and modern joint building of the operational service opened in 2015, in addition to a meeting with the island people.
The debate addressed important issues for citizens, such as the development of ship and airlines between small islands and the continent.
The country has committed itself to ensuring a regular transport link on the small islands with permanent status, but, for example, traffic increases during the summer period also make major local transports more difficult.
These are places where the country can take into account local wishes and needs in the planning process early," said the Prime Minister.
In addition, small ship port construction, interest education, island safety and life-saving capacity were discussed.
Today's Vorms visit was the last part of the Prime Minister's circular tour of the small islands, to explore the environment of the islands and to discuss the issues expected to be resolved with local residents and local government leaders.
In July, the head of government, Ratas Saaremaad, Kihnu, Ruhnu, Abruka and Vilsandi island and Manilaidu, has visited Naissaart, Prangli and Aegna in August.
For the first time, the Centre will go to the elections without the founder and ideological cornerstone of the party.
So far, we said the Environment and thought about the Savisaar or the other way around.
Now the Central Party has to find a way without him.
In this regard, they must also set up a party's colorful, sometimes criminal and embarrassing past, the Savi Island Party's supporters and the electorate's expectations.
The departure of the Savi Island will put the most difficult situation in the Central Territory in the ideological plan.
Based on so far's political practice and ideology, it's like it's the old nose horn that's playing them out for good.
A number of cards that used to act as drums may not be realised this time.
The Popular Card for the Central Party is not working because Savisaar can always be allowed more than the Prime Minister's Party.
Playing on the Russian map is both difficult because of the position of the Central Party in the government and because we also see how the so-called Savinova electoral union pushes gas down.
As a result of the ongoing trial, the patient's card is already in Saviaar's pocket.
For the mid-range, the map of the folk front and the insults of the poor has also disappeared.
The first of these is the low value without the creation of this and the second more powerful play of the coalition partners in the government.
However, one card may have even greater weight.
All the last elections have confirmed that the successful parties are those who can formulate and then implement the main conflict in elections.
The main conflict has always been around Savi Island.
If a political party has the idea of a well-functioning conflict in life, there is another trumpet missing from the Centre's card package.
So, what's left of the Central Party?
They have a strong particle machine and a considerable resource.
Record cuts must also be sufficient before the elections.
From the four years ago, the self-employed of the taxpayer's money has been mostly paid back to the Tallins, hopefully.
The city media in Tallinn is still in place, but there has been a reduction in the cultivation of political geril and journalism.
In addition, the party has voice magnets.
Their role will be to release the casttans out of the fire this time, because the image of the power separation is not enough to motivate the electorate with considerable motivation.
In the ideological plan, Jüri Ratas has to find its way, because the journey with the clay was completed this week.
In Australian waters, 3 US Marines were lost in an accident.
The U.S. Navy and Navy ceased their search operation, reported the Navy base Camp Butler in Japan in a statement, in principle stating that the army would not hope to find the missing persons alive.
An accident occurred with an Osprey MV-22 on board the USS Bonhomme Richard.
There were 26 people on board, 23 of whom managed to find and save.
A plane crashed into the sea last month attended joint studies between the United States and Australia in Shoalwater Bay, Queensland.
Marise Payne, Australian Minister of Defence, said that the incident on Saturday took place near the Shoalwater Bay coast.
The woman found a strange wedding ring in the washing machine... who could belong to?
"I started to get the laundry out of the machine when a flame washing machine between a rubber stick in my eye," she says how she found a strange wedding ring in her washing machine.
In fact, Karin did not pay attention to the glimpse at the door of the washing machine.
I rebooted the machine.
"Beside the two little kids, it's the dirty laundry that comes up right now," she's crumbing.
When I got through another washing procedure, and I started to take out the laundry, the flame of the washing machine still fell between the rubber stick and found the ring there.
The name of the man married 14 years ago has been grabbed from the gold to the wedding ring - Tomi.
Because someone in the family named a man or a woman who could be married to some Tom doesn't know, the ring is a total mystery.
Karin examined the parent’s child that he might have found the ring in his outdoors, put it in his pocket, and that the ring has entered the washing machine through it, but the child confirmed that he had not brought the ring home.
Karin and her partner have lived in the apartment in Madala Street in Tallinn for a year.
They used to rent it, and the washing machine came from that time.
But if the ring was somehow related to the tenants, how did it get into the machine?
"Now I'm obsessed and can't understand the way the ring landed in the washing machine," she laughs.
Since the life span of the two little children is pretty fast, the findings were left at home in the closet.
"The last time there have been posts looking for the owner of the wedding ring, and now it seemed to be the last time to look for the owner of the ring that he found in the social media, Karin refers to the case where the wedding ring found in Puangu Street in Tallinn found the last week happily found the owner.
"When Facebook finds and searches for different things, I thought first of all to try luck," says Karin, whose post has already been shared by nearly 4,000 people.
"Pastus has received any feedback and not all is good," smiles the woman, suggesting that the first comments suggested that she take her husband on the slide.
Then I felt like I needed this shit now.
That my husband has become the biggest cheater ever heard of.
Honestly, it made me worried at first, but later, when comments came out that maybe I've been sneaking around with the ring owner, it made me laugh.
The commentators also suggested that the ring may have reached the woman in the pocket of the second round of clothes.
"Well, the last place in six months ago, they bought a second round of pants that flew into a washing machine without a more thorough investigation, but does she really?" she talks to herself.
Well, whatever it is, my partner and I agreed that we'd have to find the owner of the ring for the principle now.
Whatever the cause of the disappearance of this ring.
A divorce, a family fight or whatever.
I think it's the only right thing to do, because if I ever had to lose the wedding ring, I know that I'd be very grateful to someone who'd try to find me and return valuable property.
Karin has also called to the family status office to get help from there to find the owner.
However, I received the answer that in Estonia no one has been married on this date and that this is the name Mr.
One ring has found the owner.
On July 21, a wedding ring found in Pelguranna, Tallinn, has recently come back to the owner, whose graveering promised to assume that it belongs to an elderly woman.
"I walked in the morning with dogs and saw Puangu behind the 53 houses, inside the enclosed track, the golden ring," Gerli says that gravering allowed me to assume it belongs to the elderly woman.
Gerli posted a photo of the ring (in the picture) on his Facebook page and in the group "Remarked in Tallinn" with information on the northern town of Tallinna and the North Prefecture.
Two weeks later, the police contacted Gerli and reported that the ring carrier was identified.
"I got the owner's daughter's contact, and the discovery went into her possession on Monday night." The ring was gone because the old lady had hurt her hand and put the ring on the other finger, and it had slipped down.
"He lost it the same morning I walked with my dog," says Gerli.
Although media attention has been focused mainly on Pärnu and the Weekend there, it is not the only music festival this weekend.
The Incikurm Festival in Kölva also has loyal fans.
One of them writes on Twitter, "I sold Weekend's ticket so I could go to the Incikurva."
And why not?
In addition to domestic artists, performers from America, Finland, Lithuania, Hungary, England and elsewhere are also present there.
The festival in the magical forest also surprises the artists there because of their charming location.
One of them, Lucy Rose, couldn't wonder how beautiful Estonia was early this morning on Twitter.
But also the visitors have not had goats in sharing the great things.
To share the Incikurmus festival itself, look at the galleries!
The Estonian U18 conglomerate acknowledged in the semi-final of Great Britain and cannot escape the A-division
The Mash began extremely quickly, and in the first quarter of which the British won by five points (18:23) many baskets were thrown.
During the second quarter, the difference increased further and the nine-point success of the rest period (31:40).
Estonia was able to win the third roller, but only one point.
The loss of the Estonians before the last ten minutes was eight points (46:54).
On the fourth quarter, the Estonian game was completely broken, and ultimately the loss with 61:75 had to be accepted.
Lost ruined the Estonians' hopes to reach A-division because only two of the best combinations can get there.
In the game of tomorrow, Estonia is confronted with the loser of the game between Croatia and Israel.

Australian Legies Standing on the Cross
Professional sport stands on the crossroads in Australia: some areas have travelled so far as to be too commercially-oriented to classify sports;
others return to the world of amateurs, which is too sports-centred to consider it a business.
Cricket Australia (CA)'s painful delays in achieving a wage agreement with players, the independence of the Australian Ragbi Union (ARU) to fire a team, the uprising of the FFA stakeholders, the difficulties of ragbilisi at the compilation of an independent committee, and the impenetrable efforts of the Australian football League (AFL) to be a flagman of social justice among the people.
The investing banker and the Chairman of the Australian Sport Commission, John Wylie, have tried to actively lead the Olympic Sport on the same path as professional leagues, placing businessmen without elite experience in sports.
Rio Tinto, a mining gigant, who has the reputation of using a tactic to control trade unions, was seen as a collina CA in the problem of reaching an agreement with the Australian Cricket Players Association (ACA).
The Chairman of CA David Peever is the former executive director of Rio Tinto Australia and hired CA to assist the head and advisor of Rio Tinto for wage negotiations.
It would be wrong, however, to think that the elites whose approach is ruthless in their communication with cricket players do not love this sport.
Peever, for example, was a regular visitor to Storm’s home games until he moved to another state.
Nonetheless, tough negotiations between CA and ACA and extremely high wages have made the impression that Australia's favorite summer timelines now belong to more business than sports.
On the contrary, the ARU's incompetent leader, former NAB's former executive leader Cameron Clyne, has pushed out Australian Super Rugby's team too back to its roots.
The people of the Ragbi Union now prefer to go to the front city stadium to watch the game between the amateur teams, taking beer and eating hot dogs.
The Ragbiliti congratulates that they have the most skilled and versatile management in Australia, but too failures to comply with the requirements of international partners show that it is still too much of a sport to be business.
Ragbilio and football have problems with governance, as stakeholders demand more power.
Both of the supervisors, John Grant ARLC and Steven Lowy FFA, have shown that their business skills are not enough to achieve corporate stability.
Grant, former Kangaroo, runs a successful IT company, but he was 20 years away from the game.
It became a value when the newly formed ARLC needed an independent chairman.
Too many stakeholders who did not trust each other decided that no one could participate in the Commission's work in any way, except as a passive fan, who has participated in the ragbilligy in the last three years.
But Pendel moved too far to the commercial side, and too many fans have been looking for a savior since then, someone with a nameful past in sports.
The Director of Foreign Investments in Westfield, Lowy, asked the FFA Chairman of his father, Frank, one of Australia's richest people.
A-sleep clubs want to be better represented in the boarding congress.
Their owners lose money, but they believe they are as worthy as Manchester United.
Ironically, FIFA sends adequacy for sports and business ethics to end the sports civil war.
AFL has its own connections with Rio Tinto, recently retired by President Mike Fitzpatrick and former Commissioner of AFL, Chris Lynch, the financial manager of the mining gig.
The role of a national leader is too proud to promote gender equality, activities related to indigenous and refugees and gay rights.
Some cynics might suggest that this is done by hiding government grants.
Richard Goyder, president of the AFL, said when he entered Fitzpatrick, "AFL is more than business, considering how it helps all these communities."
Goyder is the soon-to-be executive leader of Wesfarmers and the first president of the AFL who has not played the game on the elite level.
Bob Every, former Chairman of Wesfarmers, is active in the Cricket Australian Board.
It is often the importance of independence in terms of competence that can be pursued by the appointment of members of the board of professional sports.
In recruiting businessmen, they have forgotten something that could be called love and passion for sport.
Moreover, many corporate heavyweights are not used to press intensive and sometimes critical monitoring activities falling on a personal level.
Nothing that works in a corporate world may transfer the sports sector.
Flynn submitted a report on the disclosure of improved information showing additional payments
Michael Flynn, who served as a briefly adviser for the national security of President Trump, presented a report on the disclosure of improved federal financial information on Thursday, containing new details of the Flynn contracts concerning the transfer of Trump to the presidential office, the Iranian-American businessman and the mother company of the Trump campaign.
In its letter of amendment, Flynn noted that its original disclosure reports were presented in a hurry without the usual consultation and review by the White House lawyers and the Government Ethics Office.
According to the letter, Flynn did not receive any of the attention provided to others, since he was no longer an employee of the White House at that time.
Flynn resigned his post only 24 days after his posting in the middle of hearings that he had provided Vice-President Pence misleading information about his post-election connections with the Russian Ambassador in the United States.
Flynn also received a criticism of the cross-border payments made to him during his employment in the private sector following the resignation of the Director of the Defence Intelligence Agency in 2014.
In the information previously published to the investigators of the House of Representatives, Flynn declared that in 2015 the Russian-related entities received some 68 000 dollars of fees and payments.
In addition to Russia’s income, the information provided on Thursday revealed that Flynn has received at least 5,000 dollars of consultancy services for the construction of nuclear power plants in the Middle East.
Flynn’s work on the project was already disclosed earlier, but it was not known that it was paid for it.
The updated information also confirms that Flynn had agreed to cooperate with the SCL Group - then Cambridge Analytica's mother-in-law company - a data identity company hired under Donald Trump's campaign.
Robert L. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is a powerful financial supporter of the Conservatives, is one of the main donors of Cambridge i.
In February, the Washington Post announced that Flynn was hired as a SCL Group advisor.
According to persons with his role, Flynn’s objective was to help SCL’s American subsidiary to win new public contracts with the United States of America.
In addition, SCL hired a former colleague of Flynn from the National Intelligence Director’s Office as a leader in the pursuit of public contracts.
Flynn did not receive any compensation from SCL and did not actually work.
The new information revealed that Flynn received some $28,000 in connection with the transfer of Trump to the presidential office.
The largest source of publicised income is Flynn's work as a consultant and consultant of NJK Holding Corp in Minneapolis. This company is run by Nasser Kazeminy, a businessman born in Iran and currently living in the United States.
The Associated Press announced a statement by NJK on Thursday night that Flynn NJK had given advice to NJK Holdings on the interest in investing in corporate securities.
NJK finances the technology company GreenZone Systems, whose vice-president is Flynn.
GreenZone i is headed by Ban Kian, Flynn's business partner in Flynn Intel, a company that is currently under investigation because of its role in lobbying on behalf of a company operating in the Netherlands, which is related to the Turkish Government.
Earlier on Thursday Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), a leader-democrat in the Board of Representatives' Monitoring and Government Reform Committee, asked Kiani to provide information on Flynn’s foreign business contacts and trips.
In Flynn's previous security check, Kian told military investigators that his partner had several foreign business contacts.
According to Cummings, Flynn did not say anything to the same investigators about such contacts.
According to the claim of a person familiar with the situation, Flynn did, however, undergo a security check at that time.
Augustiblus was revitalised on the stage, the singer was brought to Tallinn by an ambulance.
Ivan ended up playing the set when he was hit by a malfunction.
A ambulance who massaged his heart for 20 minutes was invited," says the organizer Indrek Ditmann's life24.
"The plan came into delay, but the festival goes on," he says and adds: "The Publik is informed, of course they also saw everything on the stage."
At the moment, Ivan is on his way to Tallinn with an ambulance and it is not known whether he will survive or not.
Of course we hope the best," says Ditmann to the end.
The eyewitness told the Western life that a health offense hit Denisenko during the performance.
First, the man stopped singing, then he went past the play, and the man fell on his back.
The conference of Jan Newfield came to the stage and asked if there was a doctor among the audience.
A little later, he asked for Deniseko to pray for him.
Ivan Deniseko / Augustiblus
Ivan Denisenko or Ivan Blues is a well-known Ukrainian artist and cultural actor.
Ivan's music began in parallel with artistic studies at the Academy of National Arts and Architecture in Ukraine.
At the University immediately fascinated his incredibly deep bass and invited him to sing a country-wide known folk chor of the Golden Gate.
In the chor, he became friends with people who introduced him to blues and later became his band mates.
The first concert of Ivan Blues & Friends called band was held at the Rag-Time bar in Kiev on December 31, 2007.
Since then, the band has been working regularly, performing in clubs, concert halls and schools across Ukraine.
English author publishes a book in Tagalog
"The Helping Hand" is the first book of Michaels, the former editor of BBC and the mother of two children.
It took three years to complete the book, and it was dedicated to his Filipino assistants, Maricon Espirity and Ginalyn Narag, who helps cooking and holding his son, Joseph four years old, and his daughter, Florence, eight years old.
The helpers he describes as family members helped to test recipes at the time he wrote the book. This is the first book in Singapore that is published in both English and Tagalog languages.
"The Helping Hand" is available in book shops everywhere in Singapore at 39.90 SGD and also in migrant centres abroad, including Hong Kong, Dubai, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines.
He thought he had a stomach virus from a colleague.
But why were his symptoms so different?
At the trauma point, he was given a high dose of acetaminophen to reduce fever.
For the rest of the day, he was constantly questioned, strangled, strangled and investigated.
No test showed anything, but he wasn't meant to be sent home.
He understood the reason.
For the past two years, he had taken a medicine called etanercept to treat Sjögren syndrome.
This medicine reduces the ability of the immune system and reduced its ability to fight infections.
Sjögren is a autoimmune disorder - a very mysterious disease where the body's white blood cells attack normal tissue, as if it was an intrusive organism that intrudered chaos in this case, both in the glands that produce tears and spears, as well as in some joints.
Weekly etanercept injections were helpful, reducing his joint pain.
But he knew that this medicine made him quite helpless in case of a serious infection.
When acetaminophene started to function, the patient felt much better.
The doctors at the trauma station decided to leave him at the hospital for the night.
If it's a virus, as the doctors suspected, the next day he'll be fine, and he'll be released home.
When Girard first heard of his new patient, he took a course of infections to which people taking etanercept are susceptible.
That list was a long one.
The viruses cannot be treated before diagnosis, so it focused on bacterial infections.
One of the bacteria that attacks immune deficiencies is a food-transferring bacteria.
It is often found in unpasteurised milk and cheese and causes terrible nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, which it did not experience.
Leegiovascular disease is another infection that is common among those taking this medicine but has no cough or shortness of breath.
Even more common bacteria with Staphylococcus aureus may cause joint infections, but, again, he had no joint complaints.
Nevertheless, the doctor was planning to initiate extensive antibiotic therapy that would cover all these risks.
However, when he met the patient, it did not seem that he could suffer from a serious infection.
The doctors at the trauma point had not given him antibiotics.
The doctor was able to delay the administration of antibiotics and simply monitor and wait, but if the patient had been one of the infections for which he had read, the treatment could end with death even for a few hours.
The situation made it even more difficult for the patient to think he was allergic to penicillin, although he didn't remember what happened when he took it.
It created the risk and the benefits of the relationship.
Usually a decision with low contributions whether to start antibiotic therapy or not will change if its consequences can be so dangerous.
He asked a colleague, second resident, to evaluate the patient.
Girard didn't tell his colleague that he was planning antibiotic therapy, he just asked him to review the patient and give his recommendation.
The colleague met the patient and agreed.
Although she looked good, she would be practically defenseless if she was infected.
Your doctor should give the patient antibiotics.
Since penicillin allergy has occurred in the patient, Girard should be tested to check whether he tolerates a medicine that is not penicillin but is related to its close relative.
Girard asked for a test dose.
If he had had a serious reaction to the medicine, he would have had a rash or his blood pressure would have decreased.
None of them did.
Therefore, the total dose was administered.
A couple of hours later, Girard received a call.
The patient’s body temperature had risen to 39 degrees.
He was rushing to see the patient.
The patient's face shined from a thin sweat layer, and his cheeks were pink.
Although he seemed uncomfortable, his heart and blood pressure were fine.
The doctor thanked himself for giving the patient antibiotics.
He asked for another dose of Tylenol, and when his patient came over for the last time, he slept deep.
The fever had fallen back.
The sweaty rubber and pink cheeks were gone.
The next night Girard returned to the hospital for his night shift, he first visited the patient.
He had also received five other patients, but Girard was most concerned at home after his daily transfer to his team.
During the hours she didn't see him, her blood body was growing in the lab.
It was too early to tell me what it was.
It was clear, however, that this is a bacteria that is strong enough to allow Petri to grow rapidly, and that it is not Staphylococcus aureus or legionary disease.
The list of other options was long, and none of them actually saw the right thing.
It took two more days before they finally could identify the bacteria.
It was a lister.
Girard, like all the others who took care of the patient, were surprised.
As a doctor, you've got pictures of diseases in your head.
For Girard, listeriosis was a disease that is derived from unpasteurised milk and soft cheeses that causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
He worked further on this unusual infection and found that although people with a normal immune system may experience these symptoms, they usually recover quickly as a patient’s colleague.
However, in the case of pregnant women, older than 65 years of age and infected immune system, infections can be released outside the gastrointestinal tract, sometimes without the usual symptoms, and in the blood circulation.
From there it can spread across the whole body like a flip-off.
This type of infection, called invasive listeriosis, may result in up to 30% of death in patients with this disease.
Indeed, although it is not as common as botulism, listeriosis can be the same lethal.
Early antibiotic therapy can save life.
If it's a food-transfering disease, what food was the bacteria?
Although the patient and his colleague had not consumed unpasteurised milk or soft cheeses on the trip, the search on the Internet in this summer in Scotland identified a listing outbreak related to smoked beef.
Neither of them had eaten smoked beef, but they ate a bit of smoked salmon.
The one where they picked up the bacterium was a secret.
After the medical team had learned what was wrong with the patient, they were able to adjust the antibiotics.
His three-week treatment ended in July.
The doctors advised him to take him calmly until the end of the summer, but he now feels quite well and has returned to the museum and the work he loved.
He was praised for preventing a global cyber attack.
And then he was arrested.
When the malware Kronos was first advertised in Russian underground forums in 2014, the questionable price of USD 7000 indicated that the sale of malware is a profitable undertaking.
Kronost was advertised as a hacker tool capable of obtaining data, including usernames and passwords, PINs for cash automatics and personal information that is useful for breaking security issues.
Motherboard announced on Thursday that Hutchins was held at Las Vegas Airport after a weekly visit to the security conferences Black Hat and Defcon.
He was planning to fly back to his home in Britain.
The security community reacted to the arrest of its valued star with admiration and scepticism.
Some warned that claims against Hutchins could harm the relationship between "white" hackers - investigators looking for the weaknesses of the software to identify and solve problems, not commit crimes or chaos - and the law enforcement bodies.
Others vaguely considered that Hutchins could have created such a software for an attack.
In July 2014, he asked Twitter, and no one has a sample of Kronos, which seemed to be a strange prayer when he was a malware author.
Although the exact details of the connection between Hutchins Kronos’ malware are not clear, security researchers have often ignored legal problems in search of vulnerable locations in the computer code.
In recent years, large technical companies have set up "injuries for errors" to formalise the process of reporting problems and compensating for researchers.
The Defcon Conference, the unlimited gathering of security experts from all over the world, has also had a tense relationship with law enforcement authorities.
In 2002, for example, the FBI arrested a Russian encryption expert in the Las Vegas hotel room after having published a software that, according to the authorities, could have damaged the security of certain types of e-books.
The digital rights organization Electronic Frontier Foundation said in his statement that he is concerned about the arrest of Hutchins and will examine it more closely.
WandaCry Lunavara infected computers with older Microsoft Windows versions.
After spreading, the software encrypted computers and locked users' files, folders and disks.
If the infected device was connected to the net, other devices on the network could also be infected.
The attackers demanded the victims to pay hundreds of dollars to bitcoin i.
Hutchins became a so-called random hero.
The interview given to the Guardian in May said Hutchins that he registered a web domain after discovering that the malicious software is trying to contact it.
By recording the domain for $10.69, he launched a so-called kill switch that stopped the spread of the software.
His original intention was not to stop the attack, but to monitor its spread.
Hutchins, who works as a researcher at Kryptos Logic in Los Angeles, said that he didn't go to college and has learned to write his own software.
The company did not comment.
Hutchins tried to remain anonymous, communicating with the media through their holds by MalwareTech, but British tabloids revealed his identity.
He was praised in the Cybersecurity community for this achievement and received special recognition at the SC Awards Europe industry's event.
The Senate confirmed Woody Johnson, ambassador of the owner of the New York Jets in Britain.
Johnson was the greatest financial supporter of Trump during the presidential campaign and was appointed financial director of his inauguration committee in November.
Johnson, a long-term republic donator, also helped collect money for George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney when they were party candidates.
He was formerly the financial leader of Jeb Bush during the 2016 campaign.
Johnson’s grandfather set up a company producing medical supplies, Johnson & Johnson.
Previously, Matthew Barzun, ambassador of the United States of America.
Barzuni appointed Barack Obama in 2013 and resigned from his post in January of this year before Trump was retired.
Belgian officials already knew about egg contamination in June
"We already knew about potential problems with insecticide fipronil at the beginning of June," said the Belgian press representative of the Food Safety Agency, Katrien Stragier, in the faith of the VRT TV channel.
We started the investigation immediately, and we also talked to the D.A. because it could be a fraud.
From then on, the investigation became secret.
We understand that people have health issues and are trying to answer them," added Stagier.
In recent days, the news agency AFP tried to obtain information from the prosecutor involved, but that said nothing because the investigator refused to publish the information.
Chicken eggs have been removed from the sale in Belgium as a precautionary measure until the results of the analyses are established.
Millions of Dutch eggs removed from sales in the Netherlands and Germany.
The German Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt has called on the Dutch and Belgian officials to quickly clarify the matter.
"Everybody obviously polluted eggs with a banned product," said Schmidt to the German newspaper Bild.
According to the Estonian Veterinary and Food Authority (VTA), eggs contaminated with pesticides produced in the Netherlands are likely not present in Estonia.
"We say that there are no Dutch eggs in Estonia," said the VTA press representative Martin Altraja BNS.
He added that there are also no other products produced from Dutch eggs in Estonia.
According to the Statistical Office, eggs from the Netherlands have not been imported into Estonia over the last 10 years.
The latest eggs were imported from the Netherlands to Estonia in 2006.
The Dutch authorities suspect that pesticide fipronil reached the chickens due to the Dutch company Chickfriend’s attempt to treat the affected hens.
The Dutch and Belgian media reports that the pesticide substance reached Chickfriendend through the Belgian company have not yet been confirmed.
According to the World Health Organization, higher quantities of fipronil are moderately dangerous and can have a negative impact on human, especially children, kidneys, liver and thyroid gland.
Is there finally a solution to avoid annoying robot talks?
For Michael Rizzo, answering the phone is often a waste of time.
His Sports City Pizza Pub, located in Buffalo, New York, depends on the client calling and ordering chickens, pizzas and potato loins.
But much of the time is about automatic messages that try to smash the deception.
"It's about to reach the point that it won't allow other callers to get us," said the 24-year-old bar owner.
Help is on the way, though slowly.
During the last year, new tools have been added to the government's inspirations to the mobile phones to prevent unwanted "Robot calls".
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed to allow telephone companies to block more junk calls and hope to frighten frauds with large fines.
Experts say these steps aren't a final solution, but they're a good start.
Federal and state non-disclosure lists should protect people from undesirable speeches from remote distributors.
But traitors do not care that they violate the law.
The traitors reach people cheap and easy, using "automatic pickers" that make a lot of calls at once.
It is estimated that Americans receive tens of millions of robot calls a day.
Not all of them are, of course, deceitful.
For example, the pharmacies send automated messages on the application of prescriptions.
But too often the situation is: you owe money to the tax administration; Microsoft calls to fix your computer; a free cruise is offered!
In addition, junk ringers use complex technology that shows a local or important number as a phone caller, such as the tax administration.
The implementation of appropriate measures for the numbers intended for "sustainable" would make it difficult for the US consumers to hold millions of dollars, as claimed by the State General Prosecutors Group in the FCC document.
Telephone companies and independent applications can screen or block undesirable calls compared to the databases of known problem numbers and analyses of suspicious behaviour, such as a number that calls many people in non-disclosure lists.
Driving-free service providers also have tools that add warnings to incoming calls such as "Really cheating" but they are not available to customers on all phones or on many prepaid cards.
They can be ordered from Verizon and Sprint for a premium.
Some Android phones, including Google Pixel, are screening junk calls for free.
Multimedia producer Jen Vargas (39) from Orlando, Florida, said that his AT&T application marks and blocks certain fraud calls on his mobile phone, but he has abandoned on the phone.
"I rarely receive calls from numbers I don't know," said Vargas.
Applications such as YouMail and Nomorobo offer free but limited relief to homephones.
In the case of YouMail, the operator must allow "conditional calls" to be forwarded to calls if the line is not answered or busy.
Nomorobo is not available for all home telephone service providers and does not work with older, copper-based telephone lines.
It is also possible to buy widgets, some of which are quite grassroots, which block calls on home phones.
Verizon also tests the display of warnings about suspicious calls on a homephone number screen.
Telephone companies are already able to block certain calls that are fraudulent.
The FCC has proposed rules for the formalisation of such practices and for the authorisation of the blocking of other calls suspected of fraud.
This means that Verizon can block a tax-free number that receives calls for a fee, but never starts a single one.
Operators would also be able to block calls for which they know that they are not legal, e.g. 911 reference numbers.
These rules still need to be finalised.
Maureen Mahoney, a public arrangement aspirant in a non-profit consumer union, said that these developments are "reliable", but do not protect consumers from all unwanted speeches.
Firstly, the non-disclosure lists do not apply to certain types of callers, such as debt collectors and political campaigns.
In addition, according to Mahoney, the FCC rules would only cover counterfeit numbers.
Not all robot calls are meant to be cheated.
The Consumer Union wants telephone companies to make calls blocking tools available to all consumers free of charge.
In the longer term, the FCC industry supports its efforts to confirm that the caller is indeed who he claims to be.
Perhaps one day you will be able to see a green bird on the screen of a smart phone when the caller is legal.
From the lobby of telephone companies, U.S. Telecom says it may take several years to use it, but it would be a powerful tool against robot speakers.
The FCC is also looking for ways to stop following annoying calls to consumers who change the number.
If you register yourself in a non-recognition list, but get a new number later, the distributor may not know it and may bother you on the new line.
"Robot ringers don't disappear," said Aaron Foss Nomorobost, which is a call blocking service for mobile and home phones.
"They're criminals and find a new way to get past any system.
But it's our job to make it as complicated as possible for them."
There are several logical measures that consumers should take.
Don't answer the phone if you don't know the number.
Yeah, I'm afraid it's not practical for business call lines, like Sports City.
Cancel the undesirable calls.
Don't speak back or press any buttons.
If you communicate with them, they may mention you to anyone who reacts and bury you in more calls.
If possible, block the number after the call.
Use call blocking applications.
If you are concerned about privacy, check the application rules to see if it shares your speech or contact information with distributors.
Do not provide the callers with personal information, such as a bank account or social security number.
Rasmus Mountain: Preparation didn't go exactly as I saw in my mind.
"It's not exactly what I saw in the eyes of the spirit," said Bergi about the training before MM.
On Friday and Saturday, there are important moments that show how the body is.
And the competition will show you what we're going to analyze here anyway.
Today, I believe that my preparation has been of high quality both this year and the previous years, so that it is possible to run normally from all of this.
Nothing specials has been done on Sunday by Estonia's time.The mountain that starts a run at 13.05 has not been doing since home championships.
In the last few weeks, training is often done too.
I'm supposed to have a fatty, and it could be very helpful that the last week before MM was a little easier.
The days left from the physical side of the starter are like this: yesterday, the hampering runner rested, he's doing a warming exercise today.
But he doesn't want to look at his spiritual preparation, "I don't think I've developed my routines over time.
There's a lot of quiet and peace, and I won't let any rock music on my ears.
I don't need to look at any motivating videos or read self-help students, but to be here and at this point to assess the possibility that athletes have come all over the world to compare their abilities in one place.
It's a matter of itself that creates a speciality.
The MM has, of course, been the top event of the year for each light force player, and the mountain has taken every previous start, including competitions in the diamond League, as a test - tried some technical nyance, compared to some competitors.
Title competitions no longer have an opportunity to experiment.
"Here's the goal of just running fast," says Bergi, but adds that if the pre-run and potentially half-final manages to keep a percentage or a couple of energy reserves, they will certainly benefit from the next run.
The Somalis arranged a dance for their men.
When the first men's dance was held in Rakvere 11 years ago, the organisers probably didn't dream that the northern neighbors were taking the example of a small Estonian city.
Today, however, the first Finnish men's dance in Lapua is held in West Finland.
"The representatives of the city of Lapua were so excited about the last man's dance in Rakvere that they wanted to arrange something similar," reported Kaari Pihlak, the assistant head of the town of Rakvere.
"That is what happens today at the Lapland Ballistation in Finland, Finland, 2 performances of the male-dancing party, where there are 100 men in Viruma," said Pihlak.
According to Pihlak, this is an excellent example of good cooperation between two friendship cities.
It also celebrates the Jubel Years of Estonian and Finnish Republics.
Among the hundred dancers, Rakett 69 over-season winners in Karl Reinkubja.
"I am honored to be one of the hundred men who, by their participation in Finland, show what Viru's men are capable of," he said.
"Rakvere's dancing men have set up all their joints in preparation for the Finnish dance party to show a proper level in the northern neighbours," commented also on the project by Ain Bigkaev, a member of Rakvere's municipality.
The performance of the Virumaa men has made the dance show Tarvanpää artistic leader Tiiu Mürk with the well-known Chor leader Elo Veyoja.
Estonian coregraphy is based on Estonian choir music.
The first Estonian men's dance was held in 2006 and the last was Rakvere in 2015.
Evening for the disk emissions final: does Gerd Kanter make MM history?
The current MM is the eighth for Kanter, and none of his competitors in London has reached such achievement.
In addition, Kanter is the only disk thrower through history who has won a full set of medals (gold, two silver and two bronzes) from MM.
Today (5 August 2017) is Kanter 38 and 92 days old.
If an Estonian throws himself into a double world champion, he will be the oldest disc thrower who has won the golden medal on the MM.
Pjotr Malachowski (34 years and 60 days) has a similar opportunity.
More exciting facts:
More than once, athletes in two countries have become world champions of disc emissions.
In Germany there are nine gold medals, Lithuania has two.
The World Championship record belongs to the name Virgilius Alekna, which has been thrown in Helsinki (2005) at 70.17.
The lowest result of which the title has been won is 66.20 - it was done in the Riedels (1991).
The findings of the investigation show that peppers are also spreading seeds
Like birds and mammals, peppers spread seeds.
These insects are mostly known as degraders, helping to degrade degrading substances under the forest.
But lemons also help to spread seeds.
Japanese scientists discovered that prussakas play an important role in the distribution of seeds to the species Monotropastrom hum.
It's an unusual plant.
It does not contain chlorophyll and is therefore not capable of photosynthesis.
Instead, the species becomes its nutrients from the fungi that grow underground.
The plant stores small, fragile and pale white fruits on the forest floor.
Cereals have very little taste or lack of taste, and Japanese researchers found that birds and mammals are not interested in them as a source of food.
Only a handful of backbones consumed grain meat and a forest spruce Blatella nipponica was the only species that regularly visited fruits.
Researchers checked the prunes to determine if these insects help to spread the seeds of the plant.
Scientists found that each fecal tomato released after eating the fruit contained on average three seeds.
Further tests confirmed that most of the polluted seeds were viable.
Scientists assume that this unique plant species is likely to have learned to exploit the ability to spread pepper seeds during evolution.
The fruits of the plants hang near the surface, and they are prepared at the same time as the peppers leave their new stage.
Researchers published their discoveries this week in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.
"In view of the fact that some 4600 species of pepper have been identified so far, the distribution of seeds through peppers can be a much wider and still simply undocumented mechanism, not just the unique skills of a particular plant species to exploit the sprinkler," said Naoto Sugiura, co-professor at the University of Kumamoto.
"It is hoped that publicised discoveries encourage people to pay more attention to the relationship between plants and berries and seek further examples of how the peppers spread seeds."
Cambridge i Duke's child's friend should have "the right to die"
According to her mother, a child’s friend who had a deadly disease with the Duke of Cambridge should have been allowed to end his life.
Isobel Kennerley, a member of the Duke's Gaid Group, begged him, after three years of struggle with a brain tumor, which caused him to die "unsevere pain, suffering and loss of dignity".
A woman with cerebraal paralysis of children 34 was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2014, but, according to her mother, she suffered terriblely before she finally died in May.
Christine Eley, 65, from Newbury Berks, has been calling for a change of the law that would enable people with fatal illness and mental competence to control their deaths "the way and the timing of their deaths".
He said that the painful death of his daughter caused him “a serious trauma, ” and he wanted the law to allow him to set up a plan that would allow his daughter to die with dignity when his condition deteriorated.
Chinese internet sensors play a complex cat and mouse game
According to experts, a shift that can affect a large number of users from researchers to companies suggests that China is increasingly concerned about the influence of the Internet.
"It seems that limitations are becoming more intense, but at the same time the Internet is more powerful than ever," said Emily Parker, who has written a book "Now I Know Who My Comrades Are" about the influence of the Internet in China, Cuba and Russia.
The restrictions imposed on the Beijing Internet are proportionate to the influence of the Internet in China.
According to experts, the Chinese control has not yet strengthened maximum, and in many cases the cat and mouse game continues.
One day after Apple's visit last week, people began to spread in Chinese social media a way to get access to tools that are so easy that even a technical foreigner can do it.
This included the registration of a human application store in another country where VPN applications are still available.
However, the Thursday test shows that China wants to change the game to the benefit of a cat.
On Thursday, a number of Chinese internet service providers said on their social media accounts, websites or e-mails that Chinese security officials test a new way to find the Internet addresses of those services that host or use illegal content.
If they have been found, the authorities shall, according to their companies, request online service providers to require their customers to cease such activities.
If customers continue, service providers and Chinese officials will interrupt their connection within minutes.
The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request to comment.
Studies suggest that tens of millions to hundreds of millions of people in China use VPN and other types of software to get past the Great Firewall.
Although the blockings of foreign television broadcasts and pornography are distracted by many people, they pose small challenges to China’s enormously large web-smart Internet users community.
The Chinese President Xi Jinping has been responsible for new online control elements over the years, but has also highlighted technology and the Internet as critical factors for the future economic development of China.
Since the cyberspace has started to play a more central role in the whole of China, government control elements have developed.
It is difficult to identify the extent of the new efforts, as many users and companies do not discuss them publicly, fearing to be misleaded by the Chinese government.
Some common users, however, have said that it is becoming increasingly difficult to get out of limitations.
One student who studied in the United States and returned to China for summer vacation said that his local VPN was blocked.
According to him, he took this period as a certain kind of meditation away from social media, and he left Facebook with his friends a message to explain why he was falling underground.
A doctorate at a university in China said that without Google, research has become more difficult, although the university has found alternative publications that students would not always need the Internet.
He has now found a new way to go past the Great Firewall, without revealing what is going on.
According to Chinese internet observers, some VPNs are still working and China could do much more to intensify restrictions.
"We believe that if the government had decided to do so, it would now have stopped much more use of VPN," said VPNDada, a web site established in 2015 that helps Chinese users to find VPNs.
"If the government had sent out more cats, it would be much more difficult for mice," said the representative who refused to name himself because of the delicate nature of the group's work in China.
"I don't think they did it because they have to leave a little breath for people or businesses."
Chinese online restrictions are often cyclical.
The current climate is partly due to the soon important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party, which is the 19th Congress of the autumn party.
Five years ago, the VPN was hit by unforeseen interruptions before a similar meeting at that time.
Like economic policy or foreign affairs, a census in China is part of the complex and often deficient political process.
According to analysts, the government ministries feel pressure before the Party Congress to show that they are effective and able to intervene in a problem.
"This is certainly not the Apocalypse of the VPNs," said Paul Triolo, head of the Eurosia Group global technology department.
"The more complex environment and new opportunities and approaches for the navigation of users will simply allow China to switch off certain parts of VPN at the time and place chosen in Beijing," he said.
China’s population will learn to deal with these difficulties in the past.
Earlier this summer, the Chinese Internet giant Tencent began to limit the time during which younger people than 18 are allowed to play the popular online game "Honor of Kings", allowing it to do an hour a day for those who are younger than 12, and two hours for those who are 12-18 years old.
That is why Chinese young people have started using an ancient solution - fake documents.
"Is your "Honor of Kings" gambling limited?
Are you interested in getting a document that shows that you are older than 18?" asked the recent advertising in Chinese social media.
"No problem.
Get in touch to get the document cheap."
In the agricultural museum, Estonian heavy transport horses will be assessed tomorrow
This Saturday, August 5, will take place at the Estonian Agriculture Museum Eesti Swimming Equipment Day.
Estonia’s heavy-duty horse is one of three Estonian horse rises next to the Estonian horse and tower horse.
The day of heavy-duty horses will take place 23 times this year, and 17 heavy-duty horses over Estonia will be present for the annual event of working horses.
That day young Estonian heavy-care horses, stings and marbles will be compared and evaluated.
In addition, the work of the best breeders is recognised.
There are more than 350 heavy-carry horses in Estonia.
The preservation of the breed and the use of horses will also be introduced on the Surmel.
On the same day you can visit the exhibitions of the Estonian Agricultural Museum, visit EV100 cereal beans and rogge fields and participate in the thematic workshops.
Visitors of all ages find action.
For children, exciting games take place, the possibility of driving a pony or horse, participating in a drawing contest and visiting the three Piskins Science Theatres.
There is also a summer store offering Estonian food and handicraft.
The day of Estonian heavy-duty horses is organised jointly with the Estonian Horse Farmers' Society, the Estonian Branch of heavy-duty breeders and the Estonian Agricultural Museum.

A cat gene from the cancer nurse was called a cat of the year
A saved cat, who was supportive of its owner during bone cancer treatment, was called the country’s year cat.
Genie was acknowledged because he comforted his owner, Evie Henderson (11), from Lincoln, during six chemical sessions.
Evie was diagnosed with bone cancer in March 2016 and, according to her, Genie’s company helped to cope with several painful surgery and long-distance in the hospital.
The cat recognised Cats Protection at the ceremony in London.
Photo signature: According to Evie, the cat supported her when she lost her long brown hair due to chemotherapy.
"I think he's the best.
He deserves it.
He's always been there for me," said Evie.
"He came to my gypsy to my leg and sat next to my legs.
He sniffed the gips and then jumped on the couch to stab my knees with his hands on my knees.
When I was too sick to get my friends to visit or go out, and I had to sit at home, she came to me, and it made me much happier, offering great comfort."
Evie said that she had a special connection with her pet, which was a huge support to her when she lost her hair due to exhausting treatment.
"That made me very upset because I had long brown hair.
But because it was spring, the same hair that Genie made, and the fact that I lost my hair and Genie's own, was a little relieved of all this shock."
Evie's father, Chris Henderson, said that the cat has been a "great distractor" and described how Evie used to watch her favorite videos in a hospital bed.
"Evie was in the hospital for over 300 days, so we spent a lot of time there, and it offered her something to wait for when she got home for a few precious days."
11-year-old said, "I missed him every day I was in the hospital, and my family said he'd miss me too.
He's my best friend, and I really don't know what I would do without him."
Report: Mueller convened a jury in Russia's investigation
The Wall Street Journal announced on Thursday that a special attorney investigating the possible connections of the presidential campaign between Russia and Donald Trump has convened a jury.
The newspaper states that the jury is a new and significant advance in the investigation of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller as regards whether Trump or his main advisors held a secretary with Moscow to promote the presidential campaign of the Republicans of 2016.
NBC News has previously reported that before Mueller, former director of the FBI, who is now head of this critical investigation, the prosecutors of the state had used the collections of jurors as part of the investigation of the activities of Paul Manafort, former national security advisor Michael Flynn and Trump’s former campaign leader.
One of the president's personal lawyers, John Dowd, told NBC News that he wasn't aware that Mueller has started using all the jurors.
"We've been working with Bob Mueller and his team since June 1, because we want to get this over with," he said.
"We have no reason to believe that President Trump is under investigation in the context of the news of the convening of the Federal Jurors' Assembly."
NBC News has not independently confirmed the Journal's data.
The use of the jury's total is a common part of complex research and is not a tool designed only to listen to certificates, but also to obtain information and to obtain data from individuals or companies.
This is a powerful tool that prosecutors can use to apply for charges and appeals, and it may suggest that Mueller's work has not yet been done.
Trump has denied that he or a member of his team had planned Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Moscow officials have also denied the role of Trump’s surprising victory in November last year.
Ty Cobb, Special Advisor of the President, said that he was not aware that Mr Mueller has started using the whole new jurors.
"The connection to the jury is usually secret," said Cobb in the statement.
The White House is in favour of everything that will speed up the completion of his work fairly.
The White House is fully committed to working with Mueller.
Jim Comey, former FBI Director, has said three times that the president is not under investigation, and we have no reason to believe that things have changed."
"Flying American" under a black sail
Of course, I've heard of "flying" ships.
Who wouldn't?
After all, the chicks go several times a day between Tallinn and Helsinki.
It's not much.
The Swiss company Supramar brought the first "foilive" boat, Freccia d'Oro or Golden Arole on the market in 1952.
The technology was already there, but now I have a wind-driven foundation in my face.
It's a catamaran, but it's still a sailor.
What's the formula that's supposed to get into the air?
However, let us save ourselves from lying (that is not difficult to find) and look at the concept of "foiling" by a simple farmer.
Why do planes remain in the air?
The shape of the strap is that when the plane continues to fly at high speed, air flowing under and above at different speeds leads to aerodynamic lifting force, at one point it exceeds the mass of the plane and lifts the entire machine into the air.
In essence, the same process will be carried out in water.
The right shaped wing generates lifting power when moving at high speed, and it in turn raises the "flying" base out of the water.
It's easy, right?
It's going to be complicated when we get to numbers.
The plane needs a minimum speed of 150-250 kilometres per hour, with the world record of the speed of the sailboat is currently "va" 121.1 km/h.
But let us not get stuck in high school physics!
Today I have come to see the "flying" catamaran, which is called NACRAF20 Carbon FCS.
The NACRA comes together from the first letters of the North American Catamaran Racing Association.
The FCS is a delimiter from the Flight Control System.
This is a system that allows the crew to adjust the base also in the middle of the "flight", and 20 shows the length of the sailboat in the legs.
As soon as the catamaran is released from the cover, it is clear that this is not a gentleman's Sunday seal.
Dr. Monokkel and Captain Sametves are stuck today.
Pipe and glasses couldn't fit on board.
This is hardcore.
It's the speed of the cube.
"That's carbon?" I'll ask you, referring to the sail.
Yeah, it's all carbon.
"All bite then?" I don't really understand.
"No, the whole boat," sounds like a short answer.
1,70 pounds - our three who go on board will certainly weigh more than 170 pounds.
I'm comparing everything from the washing shed to the night-washed cars, and I can't even get around here - the NACRA F20 is like an unfit for a street trip.
Damn Zonda R or Ferrari FXXX.
Built with one specific purpose - to travel in controlled conditions well-sustainably quickly.
A lover of hobby sailor would also be shocked by the amount of security equipment that needs to be backed up before going to the sea.
A waterproof suit, interior socks, special-armed paps, sail gloves, cables, special life vest, helmet.
In the battle supply, the feeling that the oxygen balloon can be colonized by Mars as well as by the sea.
"So there's a great chance of going around?" I'll ask you in a funny tone.
"Yes," sounds like a short answer.
"You've been around a lot?" I'm still on the surface.
Okay, that's not gonna be a joke.
I'm going to fix a seat belt.
The fact that Nacra F20 FCS needs an auxiliary boat and a minimum of two crew members to get to the sea.
Maximum three, so there's not much toy room.
It's starting to wonder why it's not a Sunday cruiser.
Leili's forest stories " Blog Archive " Lands and roads repairs
As long as I've ever been occupied, all the land repairs of the land are now inevitable to me, whether in the woods or in the field.
The quality of machines and works has been significantly improved and everything is going to be more effective than it was at its own time.
Currently, land repair objects are mainly reconstructed, errors and closures are sought and corrected.
More stringent environmental requirements have been added, which have been ignored decades ago.
The construction materials are renewed, for example, to build trolleys, now use plastic tubes and gravity sleeves to secure, not only rocks, but also fabrics, such as geotextile.
In the past, the mouths and troupes were secured with spilled concrete plates (MP, VKP) and rotses.
In order to protect the environment, digestive water (underground drenches, gravities) will be digested into natural streams or rivers with sediments to collect gravities which should clean water from possible residues of agricultural fertilisers and poisons.
The bottom of new sediments or wings is often planted with wolves, or they begin to grow themselves from the seeds that flowed there.
The wolves have a feature of filtrating toxic substances from the water.
The dam on the picture was digged last year and this week a well of concrete rings was built to take firewater.
And so that some machine wouldn't go into the dawn, it's probably the big stone noises that were dragged to the floor.
In addition to cleaning crops in the surrounding area, improvement of forest roads is also on hand.
The interforesting section on the picture should be part of the road that will also receive additional crucibles.
On the right, the country forest, whose reconstructive path will continue immediately from above to the right, and which will soon be completed.
It's a private forest.
The raw road continues, and there it is also taking place for the renewal of crop gravity and roads and for the correction of dehydration errors that have occurred.
