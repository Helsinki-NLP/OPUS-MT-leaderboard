28-year-old chef was found dead at the mall in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the cliff of the local shopping center this week.
However, the brother of the victim says that he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him and says, "She's doing well at last."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, the Death Inspector's Office in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was sentenced to a murder and that the investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC channel to KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a liner in Boston, had received his dream job six months ago in the Sanfranciscoin Sons & Daughters restaurant.
The representative of Sons & Daughters said that they're "strong and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a tight family, and they're gonna miss him so much," said the representative.
We send our thoughts and our condolences to Frank's family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was overnight at the beginning of the hostel, but recently, "the thing went well."
"He found a place and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was good-willing, and he had a big heart.
His way of feeling sympathy with the family was to make us food, make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who was driving with the power.
"In the earth, where so many things are wrong, he was an infinite diamond that shines brighter every day," he said.
Everyone who has information on this will be asked to call the San Francisco police tipline at 415-575-4444.
Doctoral practitioners strike: Requirements for new measures to combat the work
Representatives of doctoral practitioners have asked their trade union to adopt new measures to fight the work in their disputes concerning the new agreement.
The Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) invites the Council as a whole to support new work fights from the beginning of September.
JDC says that the ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
In July, doctoral practitioners and doctoral students voted against their rejection of the agreement agreed with BMA.
58% of the voters rejected it.
On Thursday night, in a letter published by the JDC President, Ellen McCourt, on Twitter, said that the government had remained silent on the issues that he said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC Government has voted to completely reject the proposed new agreement and to demand formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain authorisation for the progressive and expanding work programme that will begin early in September.
The dispute has been followed by medical practitioners participating in six strikes this year, including the first complete work station in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of BMA’s doctors, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had rejected the terms recommended by BMA.
He had told the members of BMA at meetings before the vote of 54,000 doctoral practitioners and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement will be ordered to British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external interconnection?
Ele that ended up in the crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met each other in their hands and declared the fight of words and economic sanctions that lasted eight months officially ended.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg palace, I have a clear impression that in Ankara the desire for this reconciliation was greater.
Yes, the event was ordered.
But Putin’s smile looked like a crowded man, and he didn’t have much heat, even according to his own controlled standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, he kept talking about his "love friend" Putin five times, according to a report.
I got crazy on the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level but even to the better.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his passion described the opposite.
But Putin's radiant vileyes showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot off a Russian combat plane at the Syrian border.
The reaction of Moscow at that time was fierce.
Puti attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Reconstruction of true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the general public in Russia has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the state led to an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed like the Turks were blamed for everything.
The most serious were the accusations of high officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in the Syrian regions of Isisi.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it is time to move forward.
Finally, this meeting only took place because Putin received the apology he requested from President Erdogan.
Russia gained some kind of victory.
The benefits of the anchor's agreement on the firearm are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost removed from power in the last month’s failure of power.
The continued terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
The economic sanctions in Russia have been heavy, especially the ban on order flights, which usually carry millions of Russian tourists on the Turkish coast annually.
The figure has declined by almost 90 per cent.
With regard to Russia, local travel operators and order airlines will certainly be relieved when the flights will eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late season crash to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, the state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables since imports of agricultural products from Turkey are allowed again.
"You traveled there, tomatoes back here," as formulated in the report of the Vedemosti newspaper.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
We are angry with the western countries about what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
In addition to the long-term appetite of the previous EU Members' negotiations, Mr Puti, who is eager to use coolness and to break Turkey's bonds to the western countries.
The Russian leader must have received breakpoints from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary attempt to support designated authorities.
Of course, this is the discovery of Moscow, who has its deep rooted fear of the change of power.
So this meeting in the pramic maritime event allowed Russia and Turkey to present the 'exterior consortium', as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that experience the western countries who abandoned them and mistreated them, combining their forces.
However, these two have great differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently reconciled itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be a lot of fun that, after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed it.
The Turkish President consciously avoided answering the question in relation to their disagreements, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear agreement on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a complete disaster when a NATO member of Turkey shooting down a Russian combat plane, it is certainly better that two leaders are even again speaking.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from outside Scotland
According to the Bank's CEO, the RBS brand is reduced to the back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the international objectives of the bank.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and it had to be saved, it has abandoned these objectives.
Bank strategies have used the 'RBS' product label to protect other consumer financial bands.
It was supported by millions of puzzles used for sponsoring international sports, from Six Nationsrugby to Wimbledon Champion Andy Murray.
But it has now been considered right to allow national brands to come to the front.
Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted from the beginning.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, except the main office and stock lists, are transformed into NatWest.
The brand Ulster Bank is already in use for Irish and Northern Ireland customers.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that receive more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a round of clients and staff in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS product label will become the employer of our investor brand and our employees, because we now become much more a brand bank."
When the bank became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local objectives.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it does not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsors.
"It is time for us to move towards a brand bank, because, basically (we have been asking) it is how we can concentrate on making this a better bank for our customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done focusing on the needs of our customers, we don't own it, I believe you'll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettor wins in New Market with Predilection and achieves 3000 wins
Dettor will shower champagne after he has a total of 3000 profits after a double victory
Kilparatist Frankie Dettor secured his 3000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the spring of the second night, with his victory on his home track, when he was training John Gosden with Predilection.
45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches this rocket race.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-fold masterjockey Dettor, who used to win at Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional, because my family is here too.
I'm very pleased that this happened in New Market because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20 000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettor sucks his own cheeks when he put Predilection in the field after the victory.
Two rivals have reached this rocky obstacle competition - masterjockey Richard Johnson and 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had recordings of over 4300 wins in an infringing career.
Lester Piggot, 9-fold Derby winner, 4493 profits
Frankie is one of the best competitors of the present era, and it is not surprising that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical nose separates him from others in the weighing room.
He's a great ambassador for competitions, his passion and charismas have been attracting fans for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that she would have riddated 6000 winners if she hadn't just been the jockey of weekend and big races!
Seriously, Frankie has been riding the winners in Great Britain for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a living person who is good for British competition, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettor was celebrating an airplane that was formed from a pebble pile into a trademark by landing from a saddle.
From a flight to an airplane landing, Frankie Dettor has been the face of a British race for two decades.
This has been a mountainway.
A large number of profits in large races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' profits in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the aircraft accident and suffered a competitive ban on drugs.
Three years ago, he began to find it difficult to return to him after six months of the ban on competition, but he showed a remarkable characteristic when he challenged the suspects and returned to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettor has said earlier that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years of age.
Russian Putin is separated by Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has suddenly dismissed Chief of Staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a part of Putin’s trusted insider for many years.
63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
Mr Kremlin's statement said that Mr Putin has "ordered Ivanov to move away from the role of the head of the Russian presidential regime", but there was no reason for this.
Vice-President of Ivanov since 2012, Anton Nano, has been appointed his successor.
The persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the Estonian capital in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute of International Relations Institute (MGMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.
Later, he led the President's protocol and government staff, says Kremlin's website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State, as regards drafting laws and managing the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave the place and recommended that persecution be appointed in his place.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest allies of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked at the Security Service of the Soviet Union in the KGB.
As Head of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a public television meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the Head of Staff was withdrawn from their own request.
But despite a smile on the cameras, only a few here are convinced, especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So it's just some sort of power fight after that, isn't it?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement that the man who once was declared a potential candidate for President, suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy, has been very suspiciously accepted.
In his comments on the Kremlin website, Putin Ivanov said, "it is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex, if you could even say work, a task.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov accepted the mission in December 2011.
He was formerly Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the State Security Service at the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his Deputy Director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
One time it was thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Put after the second season, because the third season of Put would have been contrary to the Constitution.
However, this mission went to another ally close to Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister only three and a half years later before he returned to the president.
The Criminal Minds star, Thomas Gibson, got the shoe after he hit the producer.
Last month, Gibson was involved in a physical dispute at a set description site in Los Angeles.
A series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced that he was dismissed in a joint opinion.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, Gibson, apologised on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes at the description site.
I regret that it happened," he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from a series of FBI agents' teams will be expected later.
Previously on the Dharma & Greg situation media has been involved in a series of 54 years since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything I can for the past 12 years," said Gibson in a statement published on Friday.
I had been hoping I'd been involved until the end, but that's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible task force and, above all, the best fans that the show might have.
The beginning of the 12th production period of the series has been planned for the 28th of September.
Mystery fish ended up in the garden in Banff.
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish that a water bike has left behind.
Bain, who lives 500 metres away from the sea, published film material in Periscope, hoping that someone could explain the appearance of two inches of fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
1.35 billion Pfund project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
The engineers have connected the northern canal of Queensferry with the ground bridge, which means that the bridge is now extending to Fife.
It's the first of the four feathers between the "cancers" that are now graduated around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge part of Fifesta is now 600 metres tall and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20 000 tons of concrete and 46 towels.
The 1,35 billion Pfund project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the workground today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry overhaul site.
We are all witnessing a truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone to build this part of the bridge."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the finishing of the closure between the bridge and the bridge is a demanding operation in which the dimensions of extreme accuracy must be agreed.
Altogether, almost 79% of the bridge is now in place and your last part of the cover lies in Rosyth today, which means that the entire cover is ready to be lifted up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Head of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this feather represents the top of construction technology.
After the last part of the roadside was installed and combined with the enlarged northern pillar science, then we had to close the remaining part on the north side, i.e. on the inland side.
This was done by pulling the northern road from the terrain to 700 millimetres south.
This was a huge and very demanding measure at the same time.
As the ground is 222 metres tall, it weighs about 6000 tons and had to be drawn at about 3% of the circular angle.
Careful, because the permitted measurement deviations according to which the team worked were small, only a few millimeters in both directions.
I'm glad everything went well, though.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy while they're alive"
Three men are "happy while they were alive" after they fell from their fishing boats outside Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station made an alarm at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event evolving in the Moelfre Bay Bay Bay Bay Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely as their boat moved on to their own.
"We saw the boat traveling closer to the men, and we imagined the worst," said Moelfre's lifeboat runner Vince Jones.
"Happy fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving," he added.
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, and the third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging on a boy without life vests.
The men were taken into a coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: "These three men in the water are happy when they are alive and completely harmless.
The boat's engine had your kill-shaped rod, but somehow it had removed the boat from a timer when the boat fell.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunting for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see the world change.
During the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but that they prefer to spend their leisure time watching evidence.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and participate in some activity.
The screening time was initially limited to television, then video games, and now to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and external air activity do not exclude each other.
I refer, of course, to the wildness called Pokémon Go. Application based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s for video games (there were cartoons, game cards and other post-products).
Like many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before this new game was published in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed because the huge popularity of overloaded servers.
Only in the days Pokémon Golla had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
As explained in the nut shell, players use their smartphones to look for Pokémons that are traced by GPS, and who can be "lighted" (with the phone's screening) or "fishing".
The generation that played the game when he was younger has been involved in wildlife and jumped up from the sofa to search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant addition to the daily steps of "a average person".
Apple Watch Application Cardiogram, followed by 35 000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the game release, the number of people moving within 30 minutes of the day jumped from 45% to 53% of the users following Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Gota, it only sees the level of internship.
Many public health campaigns call for "find 30", "recovery on the couch" and "be active every day" have not produced any results because the majority of public health warnings are boring and care about people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be reduced.
Regularly moving people are at lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activation helps to control weight, high blood pressure and diabetes, and its benefits are too diverse here.
Pokémon Go's fancy is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air, sunshine and fun.
Some people even get new friends hunting.
As usual, the boring cheerleaders are looking for the things they complain about.
Yeah, somebody can walk through the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were previously applications like Fitbit that were able to monitor activity, they did not give any reason to move in the same way as this game.
The news is going to disappear, and the use will be lost in time.
However, as a result of Pokémon's success, other games will come that combine applications and virtual reality with real world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, better and more healthy.

Simone Biles caught gold in a women's gymnast multiplay.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Energetic jumping.
It's a whirlpool.
I can't believe it with a perfume.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast reached a multi-playing championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the light of the Olympics.
His overall point, 62.298, was clearly better than the silver mythist and the "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronsialist Aliya Mustafina.
The US Simone Biles balancing shop at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman, who successively won the multiplayer championship, and the fifth American champion of all, and, at the same time, he strengthened his reputation for his generation, and perhaps for the best of all times.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement brings him into the same class as the best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
Biles has dominated his species for the last three years, winning 15 world championships, including 10 golds, programs whose ambition and accuracy have been so surprising that Mary Lou Retton, the Olympic Champion of 1984, called him "the best gymnast to see."
The final test waited in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of excessive expectations.
Returning home to Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
The United States Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman will hug the gold and silver amital (in this order) in the final of the women's tennis multiplaying games in the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, the life.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday, when he acted as a culminating national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought about the future when he went to the top of a long knowledge, it is not entirely true.
A part of his permanto program, which includes his trademark volt control, has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also be excellent in the street next to the Olympic Arena of Rio.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a taaper, found by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman when she was on a study trip at the gym where Boorman trained.
He has not lost a multiplayer since summer 2013, and this winning pipe will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small leadership after two rounds, it was just a illusion.
Balancing and perfume, where Biles is the dominant world champion, awaited.
He rose up at the top 15.433 and crossed them by getting 15.933 permanents.
Raisman was willing to hug him when they waited for the end points, just a formality, and the tears rose into the eyes of Biles with a glitter red, white and blue limited, when the dream of which he once wrote in his playbook came true.
Raisman’s performance was some kind of revanch from four years ago when he was in a divided third place, but lost the bronze for Mustafina in the reconstruction.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, which the Americans call "mother" was clearly in charge.
He sent the public kisses after his performance in permanto, in the sense of a return to the public, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as Biles is concerned, the wide-ranging twittery of this 19-year-old year from the previous week will have a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims of serial killers were shot when they listened to music in the car
Two women and a 12 - year - old girl who died in the most fatal attack on the first serial killer in Phoenix last decade were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, as reported in the police release on Thursday.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road on June 12, June.
The bulletin reports that the shooter standing on the side of the car fired up eight times and then fled with another vehicle.
According to the police, the triangle death seems not to have been the result of a robbery, because the attacker did not take the handbags or the other adult victim had $2900.
The Phoenix police representative, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting led the researchers to examine whether it was connected to the four previous attacks.
Overall, seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks over four months, mainly in two Latin American cities.
"This is happening in the residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to the CBS subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the brown Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists have refused to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that attacks are linked to each other and are made by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, went to a hospital where he died later because of his injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The witness told the police that they were often sitting in a parking car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting of only half an hour before the triple death, which was targeted by an empty open-packed car, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Researchers found bullet shells, bullet seats and bullet fragments in the engine space.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microchephalia: "Your house will be relieved"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his age mates, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder from which his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, had not known when she was pregnant.
"When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
Which is not true at all. Of course, I promised, " he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to identify them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the institution.
"My first reaction was that "I didn't know people still do it," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he's still not talking.
But he slowly reaches some pebbles.
He walks with help and drives a bicycle.
In addition, he loves to play with his two brothers and sings.
Elizabeth's gonna show me how Edmund's invented quotes say, "Will you sing to me"?
"We'll teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not the usual sign language, he's telling me Edmund's invented some of his own sweeps.
Microchephalia may be caused by a number of different causes: genetics such as Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as mast vaccine or Zika virus.
Symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load caused by an insecure future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
He still doesn't know.
In fact, I haven't asked for a prediction for a long time, because I do not expect anyone to actually give me that.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have birth defects due to Zikka.
It'll get easier.
You can believe it's gonna make things easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
The harsh rains and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi.
The harsh and widespread floods in Louisiana led the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, and the state was expected to have more rain on Saturday.
National Weather Service reports that many rivers in southeast Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded over their novels and caused a large flood due to extreme rains.
Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said that the state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities and that assistance is already coming to the districts that need it.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Governor's Security and Emergency Precautionary Office, said that they would receive requests for rising water vehicles, boats and sands.
Steele said that the Tangipaho County alone requested tens of thousands of sands.
The flood watch is valid until Saturday in a large part of the south of Louisiana.
The weather service said in the statement that there are still three to five cents more rain awaiting the region.
In South Alabama, the flood warrior was valid on Friday, when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, and the Amite river that flows near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana, and was projected to set a flood spot during the weekend.
The weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood into several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is the flooding of the Ascension district at the bottom of the river when flooding rivers slowly drop into Lake Maurepas Lake.
The Tickfaw River in Liverpool, south of the state of Mississippi, was at the highest level of all time on Friday morning at 9:00 p.m.
The Saviors were still picking people from the flood water in the districts of Amiten and Wilkinson in the southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and son-in-law were close on Friday at Gloster.
The 62 - year - old Hansford says that the water of Beaver Creek, normally located in a distance of over 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another, close-to-resided boyfriend warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept up," said Hansford.
It went all the way to my belt.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she has not seen a beet water so high during the 48 years that she has lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family are all injuries and that he is the only swimmer.
Hansford said that the rescue workers saved the triangle in a large, military-style truck and took them to Gloster Fire Station, where the saved ones stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that the floods are "sustaining rapidly to a large scale" as the rains continue and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a witness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country was completely exhausted from the heavy rain that continued since Wednesday.
The flooding of harsh and streets led to the rescue of residents of the district of Tangipahoa from their homes and to the withdrawal of lessons in five school districts, the authorities reported.
WWL, a subsidiary of CBS, reported that a member of the City Council in Tankpahoa said that 200 homes had been flooded.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are both now under the flood.
The district president, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had remained in islands of the rising water.
Amiden and Hammond's cities have been opened with covers for those who have been evacuated.
"They can return to their homes when the water starts to drop," he said.
In Hammond, a city in the district of Tangiboh, 20 streets were closed because of the rising water, and the inhabitants were able to pick up sand holes to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
"The latest great flood here was in March," said the city administration of Lacy Landrum.
This is going to be a similar case.
In Mississippi, Chief of Emergency in Harrison County, Rupert Lacy said that the steady rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday, a handful of houses were reported to be flooded, but so far, on Friday, no flood has been reported.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods in Amide, has lived in the region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and the rain continues."
"Total bullets" was the six-year-old Mahaj Brown to survive Philadelphia's shooting.
Police report that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, meaning another six-year-old shooting in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child told CBS Philadelphia his name Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say that Brown had several shot wounds, including nipples, legs, hands and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," son's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy’s condition has been classified as critical, and several surgery has been carried out.
The family tells the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was starting the first class in the local subschool.
Brown was one of the four shots in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot, two 29 and one 32.
One-29-year-old men were reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were stable according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car in combination with a 29-year-old critical state, reported.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police will see if one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Scientists tell CBS Philadelphia that it seems that there was a crossed place between several shooters.
The types of objects that come from various attack weapons filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a constant fight.
On the street, there were shells on both sides of the pavement.
"So it seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in an active battle," said the Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi to the station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There have been no arrests, and according to the information received, the police are investigating surveillance camera recordings.
Another six - year - old girl got hit by a miscarriage on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighbourhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That is how I call this year the Women's Olympiad gymnastic team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been in every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team includes three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren's "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, which is complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia, will all be proud.
This team looks like America, finally.
It has also established the presence of dark and Latin American women on the top of the species.
In the last four years, the most successful female opponent has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was surprised to win the Olympics, and America was hurrified.
Now the world has been able to prove the impressive performances of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, where they present unexpected but mastery gymnastic programs.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth American woman who has successively won the individual gold in the women’s multiplayer.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the peak of the species, but the situation does not look like this in the gymnasts across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all walking the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympics.
They are "Final Five" (last five), because the next Olympic gym team will have only four gymnastics, and this is the last year of Marta Karoly as coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is a expensive species, and gymnastics practice mainly in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for training, spaces, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (trainers and their gymnastics and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighbourhoods that can support the species.
In these clubs, gymnasts get all their training, and this is a expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnastics.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles coach, and Maggie Haney, the coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more cheap and available gymnastic training to communities where many young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastic foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15 000 urban youths (mainly black and Latin) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (to my hometown) to offer high levels of strength to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic species.
Gyms develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as effort, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health, school and job recovery.
This team's enthusiasm makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and it's great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're living an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girlpower" by winning the Olympics' team, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards healthy, strong and successful young women.
Doctoral practitioners organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to stop changing the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the staff of the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37 000 doctoral practitioners who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July Hunt revealed the plans for forced the agreement, saying that NHS was "on-known soil" and that even minor delays damage the staff and patients.
The first medical practitioners are transferred to a new agreement containing changes in the working practices of the night and weekend to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee of Medical Practitioners, said last night in the statement: "The doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it accelerates the existing labour crisis and that it does not treat all doctors equally."
As long as the first group of doctors is transferred to the new agreement, only eight weeks, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
BMA’s attempts to resolve the dispute through the negotiations have encountered a lack of willingness to participate from the government and sometimes a deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of doctoral practitioners.
If he does not, doctor practitioners are ready to continue working battles.
At the end of April, the latest strike meant that nearly 13 000 routine surgery and 100 000 reception times were postponed when nurses and consultants were recruited to serve as the substitute of doctors in the strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to stop changing the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the members of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 doctors who are under contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the CEO of the NHS Employers Organization, called for doctoral trainers so they wouldn't go to the strike.
Mortimer said: "The fights achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a prerequisite situation, and cause concerns, anxiety and disturbances for patients, caretakers and their families."
During the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of control (Guardian Role) and reporting (Whistleblowing).
The employers were hopeful that a continuous positive debate on other important topics, such as development, flexibility of education, additional training for those returning from the Sabbath freedom, training costs, mutual recognition of the educational programme, study freedom and gender pay gap in medicine, is an indication of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are to respect the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from two pounds of a daily dose after the authorities recommended that it be given to humans for longer time.
A medicine to prevent blood clotting, ticagrelor, drops the risk of renewable seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is already given for 12 months after the heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or a second seizure.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140 000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them get another seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are due to fatty material accumulated on the arteries wall, which forms a cavity.
If there is a rupture, it may cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow into the heart and causes a heart attack.
If the clot is removed, it can pass through the blood and cut the blood flow into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have increased the risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the Iso-Brittannian company AstraZeneca, sold by the commercial name Brilique, reduces this risk by making less likely closure.
The NICE guidelines published today recommend that people receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Without the availability of effective advances in preventive treatments, even a quarter of people who have had a heart attack later receive another heart attack or stroke, whose consequences are often devastating."
The fear of recurrence can have a significant negative effect on the quality of life of the person.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor and aspirin are effective in calculating the risk of later heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In our initial recommendation of ticagrelor, we are pleased to increase the available treatment options for a number of thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Since the data on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, are limited over a period of more than three years, treatment is not recommended in the draft guidelines for longer than during this period.
The culture of political regularity permits the floration of the electoral grassland in Muslim areas
The former Mayor of the Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year because of corruption, giving an impulse to the government report.
The culture of political regularity has led to the fact that a wide-ranging voter fraud in the Muslim communities has been ignored, and is revealed in today's shocking government report.
Sir Eric Pickles, former Minister of Government, sets out police, electoral supervisors and city councils that they have ignored the evidence of the electoral elections due to the 'rat and religious hypersensitivity'.
The former Community secretary, the current Emperor of Anti-corruption, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to set up chains of guards outside the voting seats to protect those feared.
He recommends that the voters should present a identity certificate when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter must only say his name and address.
The report even proposes that the person voting should put in the finger of an infinite ink so that no one can vote twice.
Reporters should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls on the press to have a wider access to the documents and decisions taken by the informal committees or the working group.
"This would not only protect the local government from a broader culture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with the electoral cult," he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the vote scandal of the Eastern London Tower Hamlets.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from the office as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal action.
The Court noted that Rahman's “cynically distorted” Muslim community had the religious feelings of its Muslim community and that he would silence his critics with accusations of racism and Islamic fear.
Rahman is said to have led his electoral campaign on the basis of the religious obligation of the faithful Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were suspicious or resulting in the fact that a person votes in another.
Sir Eric said there's evidence in the bricks all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the postal vote of the electoral clergy, in which Members of the high-quality Muslim community said that they had pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the proof of identity by means of an identity certificate.
He says: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, were pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the elders, especially in the communities with the background of Pakistani or Bangladesh.
"The concerns were raised that... the national institutions had ignored such a 'politically correct' behaviour because of race and religious oversensitivity."
Sir Eric presented 50 proposals for cleaning the system, which included the ban on political activists to deal with postal voting tickets so that the "votes" would end.
The report, which is being examined by Theresa May, also calls for more severe amendments to the registrants to prevent the use of the election register in immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of the person who votes for the ink so that no one can vote twice.
Take systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
To prevent political activists from addressing the sound and envelopes that have come through the postal mail, where the voices are sent.
Let the police set guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to blame people for intimidation based on the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make the photography illegal at the polling stations.
Require that only English (except in Wales) is used at the polling stations.
Ensure training in order to ensure that the staff maintains the rule that the voter should go to the catch alone.
Sir Eric deploys the Great London police force saying that it's "unraising" that no criminal prosecution has been prosecuted after the Tower Hamlets case.
He said, "The election court remained the result of the numerous corruption and illegal activities of Lutfur Rahman and his official."
He was found guilty on the basis of a number of grounds, without doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticises inefficient 'supervised' inspections at the voting offices of the city councils.
Sir Eric said, "The last year's Tower Hamlets sentence was a wake.
Our nation has a magnificent legacy as a source of parliaments, but this worrying and sceptical proliferation of electoral cults and the prohibition of certain groups' facts threatens this good reputation."
Insane Kate's bike bike double solo and other pictures of celebrities in Rio's Olympics
This week, fans at Rio 2016 Olympics have been confused by the French bike Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive duel of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting gold this summer, who can spoil with his own famous doubles, at least according to the social media.
So for the honor of the Rio races and all of the famous faces on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic Sporters who seem clearly Hollywood celebrities.
A hunter and a wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the American men's Bogen Shooting Team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate's double opera on the bike track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain boogie shooter could be the star Leonardo DiCaprio twin.
Brady Ellison, member of the United States Boogball Team, has caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures rose on the surface, in which he seems to be scaring the same as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And, in fact, when he became aware of the tension of the social media, the boogie shooter admitted that he has heard him look from child to child.
Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly be raised this year: a stunning view between the British longspringer Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina's largest, obvious eyes have been said to be a Cuban-American singer of Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgia has been comparing the Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Bigger switch to the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sportal version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who both have the same strong eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver mythist Yulia Efimova has the same actor as Annalynne McCord's bruised skin and blonde hair, while the American team Nathan Adrian resembles the sports version of "Joseph Gordon Levitti".
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, right, sharing the same face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity between the pair
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site for "somethings on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and the Dexter actress really have an incredible similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical with the smile of actress Laura Linney, and the golden militaly won winner Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful, wide smile matches the Bring It On-star Gabrielle Union's smile.
The CBC Olympia commentator apologizes after saying a Chinese swimmer's "dead like pigs"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhani, in place of the fourth of the 4x200 metre free sleep message, raged the viewers of the CBC's direct Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company, CBC, had to apologize after one of the reporters said that during the race, a 14-year-old Chinese woman's drowning "as a bad smell" and "dead as a pig".
The reporter Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200-millimeter free sleep communal.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC reporters to bring a "color", was heard say, "That little 14-year-old from China was your mess, baby.
Too enthusiastic, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese supreme Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the second part of the message at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to capture China.
Viewers around Canada react rapidly on the Internet after shocking from the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane twitted, "Did the CBC reporter just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer died like a pig?
"The idiot didn't realize he was still on a direct transmission."
China's Ai Yanhani was described as a woman's free sleep at the 4 x 200-metre message final: "That little 14-year-old China blew up, baby."
The review of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was steep and fast, when many challenged him.
Twitter's users didn't stop themselves when they heard how careless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Shortly after this, Scott Russell, who was running the CBC mission, apologized for MacDonald's comment in a direct transmission, saying: "We call for a comment on the bathing performance to be sent.
It was a regrettable choice of words, and we regret that this was the case."
The CBC ended to apologize more than 90 times to people who had twitted in response to a comment.
Scott Russell, with his co-rapporteur, had to apologize for MacDonald.
Then CBC copied and added an apology to over 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and published a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
Last night, we quickly took action and apologized to our viewers and our followers in the social media in a direct transmission.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron’s comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
However, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized for the direct transmission and tried to identify his remark by saying that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize in this moment for the comment I made last night after the woman's message," he said at the CBC Olympics mission.
"I took a swimmer to perform, not him as a person."
"It's unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it to be disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client was knocked off by a woman who was very arrogantly adapting underwear in the middle of the store.
Customers didn't know what to look at when a woman took off in the middle of Primark's movement to try underwear.
It didn't improve the fact that after assessing what she looked like in her pants, she shoved them off her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to rotate and finally arranged for four pairs of underwear in a shop located at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
Primark's business at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkeston, where the woman fits the underwear and then put them back on the shelf
At the same time, the mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, said, after trying mysterious underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything."
He said, "Mans didn't believe in their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the market floor, took the underwear on the side of the couple, took off her own socks and underwear and put her legs on.
"He didn't even try to find a distant place for reconciliation; he just stood in it shamelessly."
"Everybody stared at him while he took off his underwear and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same with three more pairs before finally decided he didn’t like anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care about who was watching or thinking about someone who would end up buying the underwear he adjusted."
Davidson, a 33-year-old in Kent's town, said, "It's disgusting to think someone's taking home the underwear someone else's tried but not cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I was saying that the staff obviously tried to remove the clothes from the sale after the woman left, which is quite good."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find out that another woman has dressed them and stripped them off, and they haven't been washed."
Primark's representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place in Folkestone's movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products concerned have been removed from the sale."
This way you can defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, Rhon Mizrach, to find out how to deal with armed robbers in the immediate range.
They approached you either from front or behind, this video shows how you can pay the attacker with the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you're being approached, the first thing you need to turn around is to see your attacker and the "shorts of the line of fire."
Then you catch a gun between your elbow and your shoulder before you hit the attacker on your face with a free elbow.
Continue by hitting the knees on the knees, and when the attacker goes to the pain of the pain, squeeze the gun from his hands, hit him on the back of the gun to the face, and retreat against him with a weapon aimed at him.
If an armed person approaches from front, the technology is similar: remove your body from the fireline, grab the gun and turn it around so that the offender cannot launch.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun from his hand, back off and point him out with a gun.
Does that sound awkward?
Look on the video, see how Mizrachi does this exactly.
But remember, if you're not the master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of the robbery is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright is licking the dirttest places for the travel guide in Europe
The British tourist has put a serious challenge to his immune system and his vomiting reflexes by licking some of the dirttest and nightlyest places in Europe.
Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, engraved in Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet rinsing button and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before each object was swept, he used a photometre to show himself and us the situation he was going to get into.
However, the experiment that was made by a film called Internal Power was surprising.
The idea of rinsing the rinsing button used by thousands of people may seem completely disgusting, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen’s cafeteria.
On his trip through Europe, Wright continued to talk to doctors and medical professionals about the strengthening of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his licks left him another bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became a well-known tester for the sustainability of his intestine while traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This task, which extends from the front of public railway stations to the toilet rinse button, really tested his immune system.
In the film he made, he said, "I have been rather careless about my health since the child, and I have put all kinds of things in my mouth since the soil, the worms and the dirty water."
He really strengthened his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample had over 4,000 units on the photometre.
For the purposes of comparison, the hand reading of the opposite arm should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public hall, he refused to lick when the photometric result showed more than 4,000 units, and the results of the armed hands are less than 60.
Wright has produced a tourist's film, following the inner power, together with the Finnish maijer, Valion. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, the wedding said, "This is the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to do anything because it's nasty here.
On the track of internal power, it was produced together with the Finnish maijer, Valion.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D that helps to enhance human intestinal bacteria and immune systems.
Niko Vuurenmaa, head of the Commission's silence, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look, and that would at the same time explain the interests of the probiotes.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and then we ended up with the idea of calling Ian.
They claim that interest in the health of the intestine is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a greater context: to tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and its link to the immune system.
The growing interest in the health of the intestine is a global phenomenon, and this documentary picture will provide an interesting way to inform consumers more about it.
I also think that the document shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, director of the document, added: "Let's say it now, if I had licked some of the things I asked him, such as the nightly Russian visitor in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while some were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows recorded."
In a survey carried out by Valio in 2015, 84% of respondents combined dairy acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestine, 58% said that they are using at least sometimes products to add milk acid bacteria.
The squirrel family destroyed a rental house in Cornwall's Saltash, before he disappeared.
The cottage family damaged its tenant house with 50.000 pounds after they were expelled because of the terrorization of the neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner, Shaun Trebilcock, have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall Saltash after many of them had been complained.
When they had been removed from the property by force, the shocked residents found that the property was in bad condition.
The walls were made with appalling holes, the floorboards had been ripped, the waste was spread on the floor, and the walls had been washed with graphites.
The family has now moved away, and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, host of Cornwall Housing, said she's afraid that the real estate cannot be repaired.
He said: "This has been a real nightmare for the inhabitants, and I do not think people should have to live in this way.
There are many points to consider, as this property is likely to be known through the less comfortable groups of Cornwall.
This family is unpleasant, and their name is unpleasant."
There were three boys on the barbecue who lived between the time in the real estate, and according to the police, the family's horror had to have a street war on baseball balls, intimidation of close residents, drug use, drug sale, and excessive screaming, arguing and curse.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, called the rental contract, received a decision on non-social behaviour.
Many of the rooms in the house under the demolition threat found old waste.
A property that was used to deal with drugs, the floorboards had been pulled up.
The neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were called regularly.
Cornwall Housing evicted the woman and this partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks, time to move voluntaryly.
The enlightened neighbors thanked the dismissal, saying that their lives had become one hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived as their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here a lot of times.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here, we're not used to it!
It's lovely, now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood, said that the family did not cooperate with the local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police have been invited to the real estate often.
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own conduct and for the conduct of his family, for the dismissal is always the last procedure considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for conduct was extreme, and their actions must have frightened the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the brave members of the community that gave us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in twenty.
After the wedding, a dirty matt left on the floor of one bedroom
The employees of the housing company now have to clean up the waste surfaces around the house.
In 2014, the police made a raid to the property and found more than 70 g cannabis and wax, supplies and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon received fines after giving up his guilt for the possession of class b drugs as a plan to distribute it.
He claimed that the money was intended for the grave stone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partners live homeless, now frozen in private accommodation in Plymouth.
For many of the rooms in the house, graffiti had been wiped out.
The police say they're trying to evacuate the residents who make fun of the rules of their rental contract.
The police of Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall said that the dismissal was a clear warning for other tenants who would continue to ridicule the rules.
"This is a message to those who think that their conduct is without consequences, and to those suffering from such conduct," he said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, and the police will continue working with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a military blower flew down the shore of a shore
Sun worship tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of their lives
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane would be very low bypass
The air force said that it was a traineeship and claimed that there was no danger of safety.
Right now, the terrified tourists began to panic when the lowly flying jet was wiped over a full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft came to almost reach the touch range of sun worshipers on the sandal valley of Aveiro, North Portugal.
Refugees stood up as they understoodly began to worry about the noise of the jet, even though they did not first see what was coming toward them from behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro last afternoon.
One of many holidays who published videos of dramatic passing in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: “It went past twice in a really low place, and one point seemed to be falling into the ground.”
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing, and I really felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared from the darkness and flew in an unbelievable lowland.
The Portuguese Air Forces today said that the pilot of P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing vessels near the coast, and the plane had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flew considerably lower than normal due to the poor visibility of smoke from close landtops, but the air forces assured that nobody's safety was at risk.
In this summer, land fires have destroyed parts of the continental Portugal, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Forces today said that the pilot had to fly at low level because of the adverse circumstances, the smoke caused by landtops and the thick fog.
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
The result of the first half of exotes better than expected
The Social and Health Circular of South Karelia (Exote) made EUR 3.4 million better than planned in June.
The result of the exodus was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institution care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
Exote is trying to shorten the operational line this year.
The exote covers the deficit that had been born in the past by surplus.
The overriding proportion may be used to shorten the lines and buy measures for patients.
The overall result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exote Government will discuss the half-year report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special limiters swore in Immola, a military whale
70 guardians of the border and maritime school swore a military whale on Friday.
In Immola, the military election of border and maritime guards was held on Friday.
The tenth special border ice cream course was held at the garrison sports field.
The military whale swore 70 guards.
Special border hockeys are trained for demanding border safety, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people came for a special limiter.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special border ice creams have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces during the war were involved in the event of the valley.
The middle age of those who were with them is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event have been born in 1918.
A lot of bandits ahead of the area - criminal intelligence helps to investigate crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
In each of the 11 Finnish police departments since the beginning of 2014, RTA, or criminal intelligence and analytic unit, has operated.
The unit's operation is invisible to the outside.
A total of four police officers in the ugly police department in Lahde and Hämeenlinna.
It's pulled by a sergeant placed in the Bay.
Inspector Lahti is the headmaster of the coat.
In addition, the unit’s strength includes a civilian dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone's working in a civilian suit.
The unit has demonstrated its feasibility and necessity, looking at Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit will provide different investigations to the other police.
In disgrace, it has, among other things, acquired information about asylum seekers.
Reform of the most recent working practices
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working practices.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, i.e. the fact that the police are going to less and less and less and less until they get the alarm.
The data collected and analysed by the unit will target daily police activities where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units, and their own criminal intelligence units were set up in each police station.
The PTR Centre, acting in connection with the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, is a national leader.
PTR units work according to their name by the people from the police, the Tulis and the Border Guard.
The RTA departments, in turn, work according to the police departments in distributed areas and are responsible for providing information to local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond its territory
Where the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what's going on in the whole area of the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of its own facility, as crime does so too.
Workers in the RTA Unit have better skills than basic police.
Through registers, alert databases and observations, the unit seeks to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called sermon, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own ways of acting.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
On the basis of the practice, the factor forms a particular image.
The offer can be made on the basis of either the way or the person, depending on which police officers have more information.
Criminals Learn From their Errors
The workers of the RTA unit do not go around the city, but their work is not completely public.
As far as the methods of using criminals are concerned, it cannot be reported, as it could lead to the development of professional criminals and thus attempting to prevent police crime attempts.
The police are publicly informed of the procedures if they are anticipated to cause threats.
For example, such a case was news about the labelling of empty dwellings used in housing breaks in the early summer.
In that case, the authors put the apartment on the outside door, a stick, a button needle or a tape piece, where they tried to see if the residents are really traveling.
The examination material shall be public to the parties concerned at least.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest orders the Supreme Court Protocol, which, for example, indicates that fingerprints have been found.
The next time we go to the thieves, the gloves will be handed.
For this case, Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppa has been interviewed from the Häme police, Lieutenant Tumo Lepola from the East Finland police, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärve from the Joensuu police station and Detective Arto Judgea from Central Criminal Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse data designed for practical action.
Based on a reduction in labour and funding levels.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-step reform of the PORA, which ended at the end of 2013.
Government cooperation collects information from outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
A schoolgirl with fathers killed in Syria from London
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British school girls who left London last year to join Isisi, has been reportedly dead in Syria.
Attorney Tasname Akunjee said that the girl's family heard this dead in Raqqa Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that a girl was believed to die in a Russian air strike in Raqqa, which is the base of the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she was planning to escape the war and return to Britain.
"It can only be hoped that the only benefit of the case is that it can function as a tombstone and a will for others, that leaving the war zone is a real risk - that it could enable people to give up such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015 Sultana and two other Eastern school girls flew to Turkey, from which they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family was told that the girl had been married in Syria with the Isis fighter and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton's going to consider Garland's Supreme Court candidate if he's elected.
Harry Reid, the Democratic Director of the Senate, says that he is convinced that Hillary Clinton, the President of the Democrats, will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republicans of the Senate have stopped Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mr Mitch McConnell, the head of the majority of the Senate, says that the next president will choose the person to replace Antonin Scalia as a member of the deceased Supreme Court.
Reid said on Thursday at the telephone conference that he was predicting "with a certain degree of certainty" that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about his appointment for Garland and that it was speculation.
He commended Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "run the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the head of the United States Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia judiciary.
Reid said that the Republicans who prevent the name of Garland are the Presidential candidate of the Republicans Donald Trump's "carriers" and "practicals".
He said Trump wasn't fit for duty.
Treats says the naked calendar is "for women and men"
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirell in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they intend to find the next high-speed generation of 2017 in their NU Muses calendar.
Earlier this year, Treats President Steve Shaw told us that his magazine with plenty of naked images differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this to women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them too.
"We must begin to introduce again timeless and classic nakedness where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired with these pictures of naked female body," Shaw said in a press release where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
The models can leave pictures through the network or in personally open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The destination of the Vinyl: who actually buys the albums?
Single, middle-aged men love vinyles.
Before you run to fill the commention with an aggravated offences with a name called "Everyone-people Men of the middle age, you will find that this argument is based on actual information.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of many talks is not because more and more of those born in this millennium are enthusiastic about the renewal of physical objects, but about the digging of middle age.
Apparently, those who recently bought a vinyl plate are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, most likely the albums are purchased by the age group of 18-24s.
Also, it is not just about collecting hobbys, but includes emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy solo (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog was a TV news report, the camera would follow me when I was in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit on me. I would be clinging hard before I stop, forming a cup of my hands and saying something meaningful, such as: "Let's look at it more closely."
Let's take a closer look at it.
At the same time when Soho's charm and dirty is slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops and office equipment now fills the buildings where there were original movements - a handful of great specialized record shops are still left.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these stores trying to assess their age and emotion.
Stuart Glasgowinen, 55 followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) Reccess Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably twenty), spends her afternoons in London because of the meeting, and circling shops to spend a few hours.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
"I am," he says.
I have about 3000 or 4000 disks.
These albums that appear above the picture (whether they sent a sample by email, I didn't follow him home), cover his living room walls.
The reason for obtaining such a huge amount of albums and singles is partly the result of his available income: now he can buy albums that he could not afford when they were originally published, and he can buy back those who he sold when he was young and inexpensive.
" Most of the material I bought is from late '60s and early '70s, the albums that were published when there were 11 or 12 albums for which I was probably a little too young to get," he says.
He agrees that the buyers of the albums are more likely to be introverted, enjoying their own company, and adds: "I do not smoke or drink much.
This is my badness."
The 25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encountered match youGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people affected by the enthusiasm of the media. People who have heard that the plates have come back to fashion and who have become the need to buy their old albums back.
On the basis of my discussions, people have taken away their collection in general in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy cds now sell their cds to buy their albums back," he says.
This can explain the increase in the number of vinyl eruptions of certain ages.
But what about the alleged sense of the albums?
In a shop like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that the record stores offer comfort to the same spirits of the community.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the nearby payment system.
Some vinyl fans can cage from the digital world and choose to trust the permanentity of well-known album covers; objects that raise memories of teenage happy days.
"I think that sometimes it may be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort that property ownership creates," says Wez.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true to many people.
It's an easy way to fill your thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" the other employee suddenly said about the board.
The April ICM survey revealed that nearly 50% of people who had purchased the vinyl plate in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they will never use, while 7% of those buying vinyls do not have a record player.
On this point, the news report is likely to be seriously concerned with the stack of the Bossa nova collections.
This "prize" perspective of awakening is something that Jonny, also worked in Sounds of the Universe (the counter: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
"Somebody came in a while ago and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a radiohead album so we can put it on a shelf," he says.
This is not a big issue, but this is definitely the case.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So not parents, but younger people, late ages, who are just getting excited about it.
In a foppi, where there is now almost a whole floor for vinyles, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy-six couples, tourists taking photos, teen boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the motions mentioned earlier, it's great to see the Wild Beast's latest sinister and sex-filled pop, and not improvisation jazz.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to show a swollen psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Fopp for a few minutes to watch the various albums in the sale.
He's doing a window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He tells me he doesn't make much money, so collecting records is not really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of the vinyl is..."
"I don't know how to explain... it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have raised a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time I'm trying to look like I'm investigating jeanshorses, I've seen a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid cameras for a moment before the father and daughter were thinking about buying the Crosley recorder.
On the left, there is a staircase with a wall covering the sheets of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of modern music and classics, the essential plates of any medium collection.
No one looks at them - maybe because they're just decorative, and some are so high that they're impossible to touch them.
It's purely "artificial vinyls".
But given that even a small attention to these items can mean more money to industry and send some customers to Soho's cancers for more, there is not much complaining.
It is not surprising that the population with more likely time and money than others is also the one who uses most for luxuries, such as vinyles.
But although my findings suggest that the results of YouGov are valid at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record shops and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or at the office.
They certainly don't spend Thursday mornings shaking around the album shops on Berwick Street and avoiding the grievous, 30-year-old art TV drinker's view of it in the throat of unprecedented middle-aged men over their shoulders.
Holker is the longest living spinal animal - video report
Researchers say that the hover has a longer life than any other planet's backbone.
Julius Nielsen, an investigator of the shark, says that the record is on a female who is believed to be aged between 272 and 512 years, which is five metres tall.
French court dismissed application for unloading trades in Jungle Refugee Camp
The French court has rejected the application of Calais authorities to unload tens of temporary shops and restaurants in Jungle camps with thousands of refugees.
In the course of the Court's proceedings this week, the authorities of Calais argued that the State should be able to dismantle all of the 72 temporary trades in which people sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cuts or sell tea by 50 cents (40 cents) or sell simple food by a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Prefect Office of Calais argued that places should be dismantled because they represent the non-paid parallel economy and because they are a fire and cleaning risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the Court that trades and restaurants are vital to say that free meals offered by the State and other groups do not offer enough food for the growing number of people in the camp.
They explained that temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and free meals for those who need them.
The Court of Justice in Lille ordered that there was no legal basis for expulsion of 72 persons running temporary trades, but said that the concerns of the prefect Calais were "to be fully understood".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants had a much greater role than feeding people in extreme uncertain conditions.
He said that the facilities offered peaceful meetings for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the decommissioning threat was the Jungle Book Kids' Café, whose activities are non-profit and offer 200 meals daily, English and French hours, as well as asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s cafeteria.
The letter sent to Guardian said that the closure of the coffee shop would be a disaster for these children, some of which are only eight years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle's camp has risen to 9000 people - top reading - after the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices fall significantly faster in Finland than in the EU average
In Finland, food is drastically cheaper to the joy of consumers and to the harm of producers.
Food prices have fallen by almost 5% in Finland over three years, with an average decrease of 0.9% in EU countries.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one per cent higher.
During the last three years, food prices have declined to the secondest in Finland in those EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
From analogue countries only in Britain, food prices have declined faster than in Finland.
The information is presented in Ilkka Lehtinen, Director of Statistics Finland’s Development, published in the Info & Trends Blog.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices, which are proportionate to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices tended to be close to the price level in 1994.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then followed the turn, after which the food has become cheaper for the year.
The price is now heavy by the bans imposed by Russia on food imports, which have blocked food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
"Putinen policy has helped a Finnish consumer with a short target", says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition in industry and trade has also affected the price decrease.
The large trade chains S-group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
The consumer's price competition has been seen as a spectacular advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not the palms of affordable food, although the food price has fallen well.
In 2015, food was the fourth of Finland's most expensive EU countries with the same wage level as Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that, if the reference countries had the same percentage of VAT, food would be sold in Finland from third countries of the same wage level.
The newspaper compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the rate of VAT was seven in the veracity countries, only the Germans and the Netherlands would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the old EU countries at the cost of food, the VAT must be halved to the average level of the EU countries and continue the price competition," says Lehtinen.
The newspaper notes that the calculations made by him at the rate of VAT are guiding.
School isn't exactly the same anymore.
If you return to school seats, you may find that the school has changed during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be implemented at the beginning of the academic year in all sub-schools.
It is a guide for all Finnish schools.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of a beauty script is quitting, and instead, schools are starting to practice coding.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social learning is already read by four.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of students.
Before, it was thought that the teacher was teaching students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how people try to make school visits more interesting.
The longest backbone in the world, the ice shark can live for 400 years.
The somniosus microcephalus, known as Icehain, is only at the age of 150.
It can live 250 years after that, report a new study.
The figures make the species the longest spinal cord in the modern world.
In animal life, it only passes the Islamic Sheep, whose oldest known individual has been scheduled to be 507 years old.
The Greenland sharks are swimming along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch dogs longer, they can grow up to over five metres.
As the growth rate is slow, following observations, only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen to colleagues found out.
He defined the last 28 females of adult icefish that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbonisation of the lenses.
The average age of the investigated sharks proved to be at least 272 years.
Two major fish, 493 and 502 centimetres of amazon, were exposed to approximately 335 years of age and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have shown that ice hainarians only reach generations of more than four metres, researchers calculated that at that stage they are about 150 years old.
The research was published by Science.
Stockmann's firing to almost 300 sellers won't be reduced.
Almost 300 employees will be dismissed from Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"The result of these reforms is to reduce around 300 jobs, most of which are redundancies", says Stockmann in his communication.
It states that the number of shops sellers will not be reduced in order to avoid suffering from the customer service.
In addition, about 80 employees of support activities will be offered a new job as a vendor.
Stockmann's core negotiations concern about 3,000 employees.
At the start of these reductions, it was estimated that there were approximately 380 employees.
The reduction of the population will aim at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which will take place in the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is the difficulties of Stockmann to get profitable from the warehouse store.
Although the group’s adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11,1 million, the trade in goods still makes losses.
According to Stockmann's CEO, Lauri Veijajani, sales in freight houses have not reached the objectives set by the company.
"Personal reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive operating performance of Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijainen states in the Communication.
The second quarter’s performance improvement was particularly behind the good success of Lindex’s clothing chain.
The Ketju achieved its best turnover and results for the second quarter of all.
Lindex's operating profit increased to EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that this year's group's net sales will fall from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest northern temperature below 20 degrees in the whole country.
The low pressure center on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, reports the meteorologist Ilona Flang of HS.
In the middle parts of the country there are also rain decay, but the southernest is poutas.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as the whole country has less than 20 degrees of mercury.
The rainy areas in the north remain 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's general sports team is shaken by the doping scandal - a bizarre explanation for the trainer's pace
Kenya’s general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Olympics in Rio after it turned out that Anzrah played the country team as a sporter in the doping test.
The news agency AP told me that the athlete Anzrah attempted to appear was 800 metres of the star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya’s field team, reported that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials came to the authorities of Anzrah.
So I said Anzrah was sent home because he "have committed his crimes against Kenya's country team."
He played as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such a use," Kip Keino, Chairman of the Kenya Olympics Committee, in turn, went to the news office Reuters.
The Olympics' sports starts on Friday, and Roth is supposed to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was invested last year in the MM race on the fourth route and has a pre-existing Rio winner favourites.
According to Reuters, the source inside Kenya’s general sports team argued that Anzrah traveled with an accreditation card for an athlete only to get free meals at the race.
When the antidoping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to reveal it," said the source.
Where is everybody?
Rio's general sports stadium rubbed into its emptyness
Where is everybody?
At least not in Rio's Olympic Stadium, watching general sports.
On Friday, Rio began a struggle on the medals of general sports, but the world’s top creatures were able to present their skills to the empty viewer.
On Friday, the Rio organisers reported that only 58 percent of the first day's morning race tickets and 65 percent of the night race tickets have been sold.
The other one was four years ago in London, where the stadium pulled out of hurricane people.
The final tickets are already sold in Rio.
The disappearance of the Olympiads in Rio has attracted attention already before general sports.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the views of rugby, melona and horse riding.
When the Brazilian medal beams at Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played a beach balloon in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the view was full.
After Brazilian doubles, the Netherlands was playing against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12 000 people’s view was no longer full.
The bad business explains at least that Brazil, which struggles with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian competitors, and many of the Olympics are strange to Brazilians used to football.
Although even the first game of the Brazilian football team was not completed with the football stadium.
The publisher Mario Andrada, who was the competitor, said this weekend that 82% of tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
Andrada said, "There are still 1.1 million ends to be sold," says Reuters.
Of the 8,5 million Olympics in London, 8,2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half more than Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around EUR 9 to over 1,000 openings.
More than half of the tickets pay less than 16 euros.
In the Olympiaans of London, volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio because the organizers need money and try to get tickets to sell until the last moment.
However, the organisers in Rio have given 240 000 tickets to less-known species, such as golf and rugby.
At the Rio Stadium, there was plenty of empty seats in the morning.
Even the beach balloon in Copacaba's sand hasn't been interested in the audience.
Jukka Central Salo competed in London 2012.
We've had enough of the people with the leafs.
A New Way to Protect Nature - Get Right to Land
Helsinki Foundation participates in the conservation of the environment by new means.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant habitats.
After that, private companies and entities can redeem their rights to the country with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first territory in Lapland.
The area is virtually divided into blocks that will be able to obtain against the payment of the right of holder.
The holder shall be entitled to a veto of 187 square squares, which in practice means that no approval is required for each holder if the use of the area is to be changed.
Holding rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
The acquisition of a right of control is something concrete that can be left as a inheritance or given as a gift.
You don't have to go to bear banderols or tie yourself somewhere to protect nature," Juha Leviakans, who acquired the right of control, argues.
The person who acquires the right to control receives accurate location information from its block, which enables, for example, a visit on the block.
On the website of the Foundation, the name details of the holders' rights are found in the same map as the land block data can be found.
The spreadsheet sees that its acquisition of nature is a risk only that the activities of the Foundation change from its original idea.
Helsinki Foundation has been established as a Foundation of General Interest aimed at promoting the protection of the environment and of the natural environment.
The risk is that the Foundation would act somehow unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltia project is to protect natural habitats so that they can be intact and peaceful.
The Foundation will acquire areas either by buying or by donation.
It finances its activities mainly by selling ownership rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The aim of the Foundation is to obtain more protection countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and is planning landing from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Chamber of Commerce from 13 to 19 August.
Bird thieves torture the worst Turku of the big cities. Look at the situation in your homeland.
Motorcycle thieves torture Turku from the great cities of Finland.
This year, more wheels have been stolen in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in nine other major cities.
The Helsinki Sanomat reported to the police on the basis of bike thieves, the amount of bicycles stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year, and their parts per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose up.
According to police information, four to five bike thieves per thousand inhabitants took place.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bike thieves per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, double the number of thieves occur in proportion to the number of inhabitants compared to others," describes the police officer Tommi Reen.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have the answer.
"The publicity of the risks can be influenced by how much the city is moving on wheels and how much wheels there are," says Sergeant Teemu Muschi.
Tommi Reen, the police government, looks forward to the fact that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu are going to be at the top of the comparison.
The number of bike thieves goes largely according to the city of study and bicycles.
Turku has a close centre, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different kind of city where city centres are away from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily a primary means of movement," Reen says.
Overall in Finland, the police have been informed a little less bike thieves in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the trend of recent years, the police are aware of a little over 20 000 bike thieves each year.
It means 50-60 filters every day and only in Helsinki about 4 000 bikes per year.
"They're big amounts," says Reen.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, because only some of the victims report the thief to the police.
Reen urges people to file a criminal report on bike thief, although fewer than one tenth of the police have been informed.
Typically cleared bike thief is one where the police are informed about theft immediately and the thief is caught in blood.
"Accesses will also be found in other investigations when, for example, the drug case can find stolen wheels in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in connection with the work or police investigation, says the senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
He said that wheels are stolen, for example, from wheelchairs, indoor yards, warehouses and wheelchairs in commercial centres, which is practically everywhere where they are normally stored.
The best of individual bike models is stolen in the way of the previous years.
The U-lock gives the bike a better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves, for example, take a bike for their short-term use, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up selling, for example, via the Internet.
They stay on the domestic market.
"It has never been known to the police that stolen wheels would go much abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the wheel used must be careful because he may be guilty of a hidden offense or offense.
"The alarm bells should be called if the good bike is sold in a clear subway," Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi is always carrying his colorful Nops to protect the library of Kallio in Helsinki for his working day.
He's had five bikes, but no one's been stolen, the Beast says, "Never taken, there's been a good monk."
"Maybe this isn't so attracting the thieves, this may not have a hipster value," the Hellenic Horse wonders.
In the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, Siui Valve quickly closed his bicycle with a small u locker.
Now, the bike sniffed the wig against the wall, but usually the vigilante locks his bike into something solid, such as a wheelchair.
"There will be a lot to think about it, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says the Greek student about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about EUR 500.
"All the time you hear from your friends that the wheels have been taken."
"Because most of the bad wheels, that kind of squirrel. "
A bike was stolen from the inside of the house company a year ago.
Although the bike had been unlocked, the Guard could wait for it to be snatched.
Under the age of 15 for his crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jurys familiar with the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peers are attempting to prevent young people from becoming into a criminal cycle.
At first, the experiment is applied to persons under the age of 15 who are now out of criminal liability.
We're missing the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer jury is discussing what happened with the offender and deciding the sanction.
A week later, the offender himself can join a peer jury to make up for what he did.
Other consequences, for example, may be a letter written to the family, explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Managing Director Tommi Department tells you the model isn't tight.
We have other conciliation models that are used parallelly.
"Everything guides young people's activities in a more responsible direction so that they don't get ruined for the first mistake," says the Institute.
A model of the United States, where it is widely used, has been taken into account in the comparative lighting crew.
The idea is that a young person, after his first crime, is not going to be in front of the adult panel, but reflexed about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The Palmu Service Designer Iikka Lovio, who followed the experiment, reports that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of people under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with before.
"It's been a message to keep on the way you've chosen," says Lovio.
The comparative jury is part of the Finnish Immigration Young Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new approaches are offered to all those in need, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop financing the Trump campaign
Over 70 powerful Republicans say that they signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received it to see a draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be transferred to Congress elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump and his disrespect, incompetence and remarkable imbalances threaten to bring to these elections Democrats a sound ring," says Politico.
Only the immediate direction of all the funds to the Congress elections can prevent the Republicans from drowning the Trump decorated anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as the chances of Trump to win the presidential elections will be reduced every day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in next week.
Among the signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people organized by the letter is my republican Andrew Weinstein, who is clearly opposed to Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "humans who want to protect the party's majority in the Congress" and that it is not the support of anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump's actions that are believed to infringe millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous autonomous tendencies.
Previously this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trumps as President.
Clinton promises relief to the U.S. families of children
In the United States, Hillary Clinton, the President-in-Office of the Democrats, told me about the details of its economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to become President to make the US economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to be president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," said Clinton in his speech.
The Clinton Plan focuses on a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve US infrastructures - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part by tax increases for rich people, partly by private money.
The construction programme is hand-in-handed to the American duunas who are suffering from the transition of factories to the low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in good-paid jobs after World War II.
We're a builder. We have to get back to building!
Clinton told me.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the status of working children’s families.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, highlighting that rich people should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to be tax-free, it's gonna have to pay for the tax on departure, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"I, as President, oppose all trade agreements that work against employees or wages," said Clinton.
According to the speculations published in The Washington Post before Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticise the economic programme published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday that it " recommends only millionaires such as this".
The discount proposed by Trump on corporate tax Clinton has previously been appointed "Trumpin pork".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and the clothes that Trump himself manufactured in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton spiked.
These are Rio's viewers: The races have not tied Finns to the squares, but the mobile app is interested
Normally, sports races are seen as the sharpest mountain tips in television viewers’ statistics.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not been reaching out to the cheeks of viewers.
At one time, 12 per cent of the population have been attached to the squares at best: on Tuesday night, the swim was followed by 615 000 people from the Yle Olympic Channel2 at the same time.
As a result of comparison: the month-on-month general sports games at the TV2 received almost 800 000 audiences at a time, and the EM Games in football were fairly second million.
To date, the Olympics have been most interested in cycling on Sunday night and the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million people at the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, Head of Sports, is pleased with the audiences, and reminds us that the viewers are distributed in the Olympics of Rio for the first time in several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns are following the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much of the TV viewers will choose the Olympics in general.
The TV viewers also share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports contests Yle has owned a whole channel.
When the shipment arrives 24 hours a day, and there are viewers from 20 000 to 50,000, it is a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in London’s 2012 or in Beijing’s 2008 races, but the difference is explained by the difference in time difference - a large part of Rio’s competitions becomes in Finland at nighttime.
Another reason for the distraught interest - if someone thinks it now - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken the initial races of someone's surprise medal, the interest would have bumped up with it.
In addition, general sports are about to start, as is the case with other Finnish interesting species: sailing and riding.
At first, according to Pokkise, the number of viewers has been close to what was expected.
When the general sports starts, the audience will explode.
The Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the races, which rose on the first days of the races in Apple's App Store for Finland's most downloaded free application.
By Monday, the application was loaded 150 000 times.
I'm guessing we're already going on 200 000 downloads.
"We'll only get the blood viewer numbers later," Pokkinen says
Rio Arena has not acted with all users in the desired way.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the mistakes have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by delays and other small technical problems at the beginning.
Applications have provided updated versions that should correct errors.
The Olympiads of Rio are more visible on Yle’s channels and arena than any other sports event ever before.
From Yle Fem, you can follow some species, and on the radio, Yle Speaking carries games every day.
The Olympics are not only the hardest worker to Yle ever, but the last ones that can only be followed from Yle’s channels.
From 2018 onwards, the Olympic Sports will be displayed both in Yle and in commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Day, with a depth of 95.3 metres on the cross.
It could be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technician instructor, found a weight of about 20 square metres on the cross, the bottom of which the diving computer showed 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre was in vain to confirm the observation by digging.
The method may not be found in a small depth of 100 metres, says the development engineer Jari Hakala.
So now the official depth remains 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are the Inari lake (92 metres) and Suvaswater (90 metres).
Saima, Toisvesi and the Main Lake reach over 80 metres.
They have not been investigated as closely as Päääääääääät.
Especially the bottom of the Inari Lake has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths in it," Kannila is wondering.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Juka Lake, 23 metres.
In this way, your Day cannot reach the ten deepest, and the summer water is still far from the top.
Correction on August 12, 14.29: The last copy corrected in which the deepest lakes of the middle depth were wrong.
Fascinating Tax: The tax on pensioners is still tighter
The tax on pensioners is still tighter than those for employees.
The lover says that the misconduct was raised under the parliamentary elections, and that the tax on pensioners was promised to be equal to those who have paid.
This is not the case in the government's presentation.
We believe that it should definitely be there.
After the elections, the promises made should be maintained, he says to the Media of the West.
At the beginning of this year, employees received income reductions which reduced taxation.
In the parliament, the issue was raised by the opposition's representatives, who swept the Minister of Finance, Alexander Stubb (Kok.) on election promises.
Buying power is secure, it won't grow.
In the line presented by Minister of Finance, Petter Orpo (Kok.), the tax reductions are, according to the Ihaean, mainly about protecting and not increasing purchasing power, since the wages will not be increased next year.
He says that tax reductions have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
The lover is pleased with the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Orpo's desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been concluded in a difficult time.
He says that it is important for credibility to adhere to the agreement.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done with the strength of the social partners, so it must not be put into question.
This will be needed because the economy is so much in the reserve of domestic demand and people's own future beliefs.
Long-term unemployment in offense
The lover appeals to the government to deal with long-term unemployment in a budget line, at least to stop growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed persons was about 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if the growth does not stop, the government's objective of raising the employment rate to 72% is to run away.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, the permit will have a very large social fall.
Ambassador: In the attacks in Thailand, there is no known Finnish victims
At least four people died last night in Thailand and last night in the bombings of Finland's time.
The embassy calls for Finnish observers in the country to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
It is not necessary to cancel their trip to Thailand because of explosions, but the embassy’s instructions should be followed with caution, says Westphalen.
Very little Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thai travel season is due to the yearly exchange.
Most of the Thai tourists will be from South Europe and China at this time of the year.
The Finnish embassy has received some comments from the Finnish embassy in Thailand through Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has tried to pursue the Finnish people, especially Hua Hin, in order to obtain information on the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts at Hua Hin are out of town right now.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the factor
According to Westphalen, there's not yet any information on whoever killed the attacks.
The Ambassador believes that events may be linked to the political disruption of the divided society in Thailand and to the last week referendum on the Constitution of the Military junta.
The Act was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who declared they were against the law.
In the southern regions of Thailand, the ethnic conflict associated with the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
The Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, previous attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local celebration day in Bangkok, says Westphalen.
He says that the Queen's birthday and her mother's day are celebrated in the city.
Transport in the city is very small.
The impacts have an impact on the day's time to ensure that the authorities are very precise in terms of safety.
Thailand Police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism is also closed, says the Thai Police News Office AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand in 24 hours when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the popular tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In the Finnish tourist destination, the holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs in the night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to the current data, they did not require death.
Two bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the magazine.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the magazine.
According to the local authorities, in the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, four bombs have been exploded yesterday and today.
At least one of both double bombs died.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than in South Thailand and in the city of Trang.
At least one person died in each of these attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists because it is transported to Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
Not known whoever hit the attacks
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the military junta ruling Thailand, the attacker is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusing.
We don't have to panic people any more, he told the reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, Vice-President for Security, at least Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He said to Thai BSB that the authors have been aimed at destroying the country's tourism because all the attacks have occurred in tourist destinations.
The Finnish embassy calls on Finnish people to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finns of Thailand aren't supposed to cancel their trip because of explosions, but it's worth not taking care of instructions from a large-scale one, says Westphalen.
In vulnerable Europeans
The attacks and victims of Finland during the night are known to date very little.
Last night's attack at Hua Hin has been a little more information.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians among the wounded.
At least three people were wounded in the last hit of Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded in the nearest clock tower known as sightseeing.
The Thai PBS tells me that the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin, from which it believes it has found another bomb.
According to the governor of the county, the Surat Than bomb was hidden in the flower cap.
A municipal worker died in a hit.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack that exploded every half an hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The United States Party won the women's quadruple
The United States Alexandra Raisman was second point 60.098 and the Russian Alija Mustafina third by 58.665 points.
Partys, 18, she's still looking for a tennis championship in Rio's races on a permanent, jumping, and a barbecue.
Biles has been controlling women's gymnastics in mind for the past few years.
He's got eight personal world championships for three Edules.
Fourth and permanto championships he has won three times in a row, and in the last and the next year of the tree.
In the U.S. team, Biles, two team competitions have reached the world championship.
Biles has the narrower MM militates from the woods and jump and the woods.
Asian Finnish entrepreneur: "Ishman has no influence on tourism"
Esa Huovila, a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club in the same property, has not been concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not believe that this will result in anything more amazing, it is estimated that Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur, worked for about 20 years in Asia.
A experienced entrepreneur has seen a lot of tragedy in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First, it was a tsunami, then avian influenza, and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
Even if these former tourists have not exiled the tourists, I doubt this.
The office of the Huovila company is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
At about nine, the worker called local hours and said that you shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local workers came to work in the usual way this morning.
They thought the roadblocks were set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many people haven't even heard of the attacks on the beach.
At 6: 30 p.m., Thailand’s time on Patong was normalized and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
According to the scene, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila at the scene of the attack.
Later, this car was seen in Kruunuve with Jouxholmine.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
The patrol discovered two men suitable for the emblems, hiding in a close six.
The other man was arrested immediately.
The other one escaped, but later the man was found in the woods by means of a police dog.
Men are suspected of stealing, stealing and serious damage to motor vehicles.
The police thank you for giving the tips.
Research Director on Russian Directorial Changes: Clear side transfer
On Friday, the highest leadership change took place in Russia for years when President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov, the head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Geneno.
He's an ex-diploma and he's been Ivanov's second man.
Kangasporo says that the reason for the separation of Ivanov could be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one of the ways in which power is used.
This is a way of preventing people from spreading independent power to themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been intimidated with or screwed up with other leaders.
Invasion in Ivanoville
Ivanov, a member of the Putin's interior, is moving to specific functions in environmental and transport matters.
With the state media on the tape Putin said the change to a common decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed persecution in place, said Russia Today.
Kangasporo says that from the point of view of Ivanov, this is a clear fall in position.
Environment and transport are not very high in Russia in order of priority.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russia.
Ivanov has also played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangasporo points out that the old map, such as the governors, has recently been exchanged in Russia.
The older researcher, Katri Pynnoniemi, from the Foreign Policy Institute, says that more interesting than the heir of Ivanov’s place is to turn Putin into a younger neighborhood.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when they retreated in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the city of Jarabulus so we could not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurdishists received about 90 percent of the important city of Manbij to Isisi last week.
However, it is estimated that there were tens of jihadists left in the city.
Corrected from the previous news at 19:30: We used to say wrongly that civilians were fleeing the city, and Isis fighters actually kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of Interior documentary publication line is illegal
The Ministry of Interior's guidance on public access to documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law, Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutian tells the STT that the documentary publication cannot be based on the Authority’s own policies but is based on the law.
The Ministry of Interior previously refused to issue a list of participants from the Minister of Interior's visits to the evening-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision by a letter of the Council of State and by the fact that the information was entered in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministerial Communication Manager says to the STT that the Ministry has noted the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympia show begins in Rio
Like the last few years, Bolt's been running against time under high-value races.
He was insulted from his early age and had to skip the Japanese Olympics.
This has not been the perfect preparation, but I'm much better.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low - costume dancers and fans.
Porina Bolt is surrounded by the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in a period of general sports struggled with doping scandals and luxurious interest.
Bolt’s previous loss in the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he deported at the beginning of 200 metres in 21,05.
At that time, the 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that was slowed down by your injuries and loose exercise.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres to crush the world record and the final celebration of the competitors in 9,69.
It's harder.
A year later, at the Berlin MM race, Bolt reached his career at the time of the billboard clock.
The world record in Berlin is still valid for 9,58 hundred metres and 19,19 two hundred.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is seeking a world record of 200 metres and a 19-second underrun, but no one believes that it is born but Bolt himself.
The 100 Bolt challenger is Justin Gatlin, the Olympiad winner of 2004 in Athens.
Last year at the Beijing MM final, Bolt defeated the American with only one hundredth seconds.
Bolt has not lost in the final of the prize races during his reign in Beijing once if only he has made his journey.
In Daegu, 2011, a hundred MM finals remained unrunned from Bolt because of the wildlife.
Bolt will fill up a lot in 30 weeks.
He's an old man in the species of young men, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
The last goal of your career, Bolt has set up next year's MM contests in London.
These are the Olympics who'll separate me from the rest.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm underground, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago at the Sports Illustrated interview.
Exposures from Rio: two sportsmen are suspected of doping tricks
According to the Chinese National News Office of Xinhua, Chen Xinyi, 18 Chinese supremacy has given a positive doping sample in the Olympics of Rio.
The Chinese smuggler Chen Xiny's doping sample found traces of the substances that were banned.
Bulgarian beverages Silvia Danekova are also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenyan general sports coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the sportsman.
Silvia Danenova has given a doping sample with signs of epoh hormone.
He was in the fourth place in Rio in a 100-foot butterfly of women.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estado, the Chinese supreme drug has taken its doping case to the CAS of the International Petitions Court of Sports.
Xinhua tells me that a sample given by Xiny on Sunday would have been found as evidence of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There are also other doping suspects in Rio.
BBC news that Bulgarian female drinks Silvia Danenova has given a doping sample with signs of epophormone.
Kenia has, in turn, sent a general sports coach home from Rio for a doping trick.
On Thursday, the International Olympics Committee reported that the Kenya Coach had become an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, it's Kenya's high-speed trainer John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich race pass in the situation.
Phelps can't be stopped by any historical gold came into display style
The most successful athlete in the Olympic history, Michael Phelps, U.S.A., swimming in 200 metres of his 22th Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic Golds.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer in the four consecutive races of the same species’ Olympic gold.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was located in confusion before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun, Helen Skelton, the BBC Olympiad commentator, laughs at the midnight magazine's quick interview.
The case of Helen Skelton (October) on Monday is on the website of the evening magazine, which is most read this week.
Next to you, commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton isn't much stress if the somé or the British press has a little trouble with his revealing and special costumes.
The television is visual media, he's emphasising.
Skelton has been dressed with high-level shoes and short-cream dress, which certainly has at least enough openness - at least for many conservative British boys.
However, there are no back-stages.
It's important to look good, and little judges are just a fun thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to squeeze you, and maybe it's a bit of a shock, but he stresses that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here watching sports, and the focus has to be at the sports.
It shouldn't be so important how I dress.
Can you imagine that the hood has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that pays attention to how much these swimmers do their work and how big sacrifices they make is for me, Skelton's refreshing.
You know what?
It's ugly out of nowhere if it comes from dressing (the drinker).
I'm having a little fun if one of these hit someone's radar.

The Argentine lady dressed Betrayer-Siren, the Finnish woman thought about protests
The wind of the Beaster-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Beaster-Siren experienced hard on Thursday.
The Argentine lady dressed Tuuli Peijer-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surfing day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent confessed to the failure.
He got stuck because of the accident, and others ran away, told Joakim Wilenius, Finland's main coach.
A sportsman thought about protesting for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing so because it would have been for nothing according to the Olympics rules.
I should have dropped in the water so I could have gotten a refund, the Beaster-Siren said.
The Finnish guy hanged on his desk until the last time, because he didn't want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
With the crash, the Finn remained in position 27.
In the overall situation, the 2012 Olympic Hopi Heading in London is the eighth.
With respect to the berries, the crash didn't seem to have much effect.
Friday is a big day when we're going to race 10-12.
Modified 0.39: By way of derogation from the first information, Petaja-Siren did not protest.
7 Special issues that, according to science, prolong the age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring a person more years to life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life will last.
Sometimes things that a person cannot influence can bring him more years.
These include, inter alia, tendency to mean body fat or social status.
Regular shopping may extend your age.
You don't always have to break it, just picking up a milk can.
The secret of the long age has been sought to find out by many different studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee beverages have been shown to protect from river cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’ s and Parkinson’ s disease.
The Harvard University study concluded that a moderate coffee consumption is linked to "a reduced death risk", especially with regard to neurological or heart-related diseases.
In the name of alcohol again, studies that suggest a reasonable use of one to three daily doses may extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental wire can extend the life of a person by even more than six years, one study reports.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation.
However, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway revealed how laughing affected the life of a person.
Over 54,000 people were monitored by the seven-year project.
Those who laughed more were more insulted by 35 percent more likely to live after the experiment.
Sex, when protection against sexual diseases is taken into account, has been found to be good for health.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, it is not enough just to have sex as it is.
In order to get more years of life, a person should also have an orgasm.
Mobility will certainly bring more years, and it will not be contested.
However, the achievement of a long age does not require absolute soccer.
One study at Oxford University found that women with large backs had lower levels of cholesterol.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
It was either an athlete or an actor who won Oscar, who was more likely to live longer than a regular bully.
Many studies have tried to find a reason for this phenomena.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life to the next years.
Some scientists think that the long age is due to the social status of a person, which, for example, will make it possible to pursue recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour of people over 65 years of age found that a daily shopping person, which is likely to be a lesser buyer.
This is due to the fact that running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may premature death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
A lost-humoured ride-on-way truck
On Friday night, a serious truck truck and a passenger car accident occurred in Koske, Varsinais-Suomen.
The accident occurred in Kosske, in the middle of Koskents and the Sorvastons on Friday at 9:00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa when the passenger car came to the same track, hit the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck got on its backside, but it got burned.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
A passenger car slipped into a stream and then across the door to the roof.
A woman who carried a passenger car, born in 1972, remained pressed in her car.
The rescue facility removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the University Hospital in Turku.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 promilles.
He's suspected of a horror drunk.
The mail sent to the wrong city.
Salon K-Citymarket’s bulk sausage selection was deficient because the mail had accidentally delivered a part of the load to the Wall River.
On Thursday, Teija Halt, who lives in Pernie, was buying sausages from Salon K-City Market when a funny sign hit the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the crucibles because the Posti delivered our load to the Wall River!
We'll get more when Post gets the load delivered!
So if it doesn't burst in the lawn candy, it read on the sign.
The veiling sign of the trader relates to the fact that Posti extended its services last spring to grass cutting.
The grass will be available for Post until the end of August.
In Haltia’s view, the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it in the social media.
Well, it's the best thing to do with the upgrade.
Media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention that this is raised is incredible, and Halt is wondering.
On Friday night, Haltia had more than 700 divisions on Facebook.
He got his own favorites grabbed in a sausage bag, even though some of the lairs were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesja, responsible for the business of the company transport services, regretted the damage to the evening-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages were diverted to the wrong place yesterday (the Wall River) and no longer left to do part delivery (Saloon) by three, but we only took five stages today, and Kaidesa told Ilta-Sanom.
It was the first news in the afternoon.
Teija Halt wasn't upset about the sign because he found all of his own lovers in the selection.

Wish of the family of a woman murdered in Lovisia: Recognition of the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Lovisia hopes that the victim would be remembered by donation for police dog work instead of flowers and adresses.
Sipoon's veterinarian station has published a Facebook update where it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as an alternate at the Sipoon Veterinary Station and had also completed his nurse’s training there.
The veterinarian station remembers a woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, sense of humor, and unforgivable work.
Good friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
Facebook updates include an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donation funds go to police dogs, primarily to the purchase of safe vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovisian woman was murdered in her own home in Lovisa Koskenkyla.
The woman's neighbors have said to the evening magazine that the victim was very animal-friendly.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and cocks.
A 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder knew the woman and had no connection.
The murderer was tracked by a police dog, Börje, who was wounded alive in a arrest situation.
But the beer survived, and he's recovering.
The Court of Justice issued a judgment to Post on infringement of the Equality Act
The post did not have the right to arrest the wage of a worker who refused to train the tenant, which was assessed in the judgment of Kanta-Hämee.
The right to pay Post most of the salary arrested to the employee and EUR 2 000 in the form of a compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only a part of the investigator's salary, which corresponded to the share of the knowledge of all day's work.
According to the law of the Municipality, the worker had been put in a more favourable position on the basis of his trade union activities in breach of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the PAU organisation decision of the Postal and Logistics Union on the ban on learning.
During November last year, PAU made a decision that post workers would not be familiar with those who violate the strike.
It was first reported by the People's News.
Returning Turkey to a path that respects human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and respecting human rights, writing Prime Minister Juha Sipila (centric) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
The Journalist Alliance earlier asked Sipilla and Soin to express their concerns for freedom of expression and of the press.
Sipil and Soini say repeatedly that Finland has brought Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and of speech.
Putin fired the head of his administration... as an official persecution.
President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, the head of the presidential regime, Sergei Ivanov, reports.
We'll be in the place of the Soviet-Viron Communist Director Karl Nano's grandson Anton Nano.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, reports by Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, who belongs to a close interior of Putin, is moving to the Kremlin bulletin for specific functions in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed persecution in place, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked together with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB spying.
Many viewed Ivanov as possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed as President before Putin re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition for a ban on the game... can't be seen in Valoliiga's opening.
The world recorder of football transfers can't be seen in the field when the British Valeoliga kicks in the weekend.
Paul Pogba's game ban followed up with him in England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition Paul Pogba is on the side of ManU opening his league on Sunday against Bournemouth due to a gambling ban, reported by BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million from Pogba to the Italian Society Juvent.
However, the English Football Association FA keeps him out of the game because Pogbale was under the pressure of Juventure.
He received two warnings last season at the Italian cup, and it becomes a single game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told BBC.
Pogba's next step to play is in the second league on 19 August when ManU meets Southampton.
Flow's greatness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the position of Flow Festival as an internationally renowned event of world top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
It's typical that the festivals have expressed themselves with their self-preservative dressing.
One of the main stage artists is this year the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is paved with artificial grass and artistic installations, among other things.
We have never had enough to have just a headboard and a beer, says Thomas Kallio, the artistic leader of the event.
Flow Festival in Summer Bay in Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block to tens of thousands of visitors.
There is a simple question behind success: what kind of event would the authors want to go?
It is quite different in the productions of events to think this way.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was coming to the end this year.
The aim has been to raise the number of visitors from 70 000 last year with 5 000 people.
The Festivals will also be seen this year by a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because it must be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a cattle that is being guided in the vast roads.
That's not what we want.
In 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been embedded with 130 performers, artistic instalments and numerous restaurants and drink bars in the part of the artificial grass area.
In addition to the main platform and smaller stages, 15 000 people tents will be used this year as an event site.
Kallio admits that the event could be made more simple.
Maybe I'm a little crazy, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If it disappears, this isn't our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even the great visions today are practically possible.
In the early 21st century, activities were very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for some EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow amounted to around EUR 6 million.
It can produce "green things" like building a tent of 73 metres wide.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own dressing.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been knownly profiled to be particularly fashioned.
We want to break up first and foremost with content.
Yet, fashion events also fit Flow’s value world: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the legend of the Pink, Iggy Pop 69.
A man has a huge group of fans in his genera, but he doesn't have indigenous music, pop music, rap and soul in combination festivals that are the most typical performers.
According to Kallio, Iggy was busted because it is probably the last time we see this at a show in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
Not just what the commercial radio calls.
Iggy's latest record is damn good and he's done damn good jobs in recent years.
The Thai tourist parade bombs were hidden in the flower bags, and the tourists fled in fear.
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded from the local time on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 injured.
Apparently, the bombs were hidden in a flower bag and blown up with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were blown at the same time as the tourists started to leave the bars and return to their hotels, said the police representative Samoer Yosumran CNN.
Since 1989, the wildlife protector Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, was a lot of talking about your attacks.
If the TV isn't properly seen, you can look at it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The crowd ran against me and said that the bomb has exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bars, told the Swedish Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning local time exploded two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Shortly after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket by favouring the Finns.
No one knows is dead.
At the same time, there was another double bomb attack in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that hadn't had yet to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel forces behind the bombing, who are not satisfied with the operations of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that this may also be the case of criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been intimidated by criminal organizations involving trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new ready team will begin to fight first in a war situation
In the acute war situation, backups are only ordered to take battle missions after several months of the vow of the military oath, says the Central Finnish.
According to Brigade General Jukka Sonnisen, the Head of Education of the Defence Forces interviewed by the Press, for example, of the backup men serving 5.5 months in the war situation, are only those who are in the final stage of their education.
According to the head of education, the service is first assigned to the reservoirs of the emergency forces.
No backup or reserver is ordered to perform a task that has not been trained as required, Sonnien says.
In the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces began to train backups in immediate readiness units from next year.
Units may be used in military operations if necessary already during backup training.
Pamela Tola got huge compensation from the home house.
The actor Pamela Tola and his ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a rough fight in the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The retail price of the two-fold separate house had been EUR 330 000.
After trade, however, there was a serious moisture problem in the house, causing a risky microbial growth for health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in decommissioning in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so the economic losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple brought it to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both court and court court.
The court of court sentenced the case on Wednesday.
It maintained the judgment of the Court of First Instance ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the costs of the couple's proceedings and investigations totalled EUR 47 344.
The right to a reasonable reduction in prices was slightly due to the fact that the buyers had already been aware of the need to repair the apartment.
However, according to the court law, the errors revealed were substantially more serious than had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola, in court, told me that the couple had specifically searched for a good home because they did not want to take repairs.
He had the idea that the building was basicly renovated and in good condition and that the aspects mentioned in the fitness check report would not be harmed.
The fitness check report mentioned as risks and deficiencies in ventilation and the lack of adequate management of drained rain and melting water.
However, the discussions did not show that this was a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma realized that the rainwater from the rock should be slightly controlled in a few years.
The goods were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the moisture problems of the apartment were much more serious than they thought.
Checks carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth, according to the Witnesses, due to both the rainwater of the rock and the capillary rising soil.
On the west side, the air contaminated by microbials was estimated by the inspector that it could also enter internal spaces through the porch.
A health riskable, cross-limited moisture or shark was found in cottages in the home house, in the basement stairwell, in the living room's window and in the basement washing room.
The therapists were built without permission
The court also argued whether the apartment was in breach of the construction permit.
The Court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that anti-authorisation had been made.
Among other things, terraces were built, although there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, home problems were a central issue in the court of law.
According to the court, the buyers could, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for measuring repairs in the near future.
Tola and Warom felt that there was no specific reason for the court to carry out a more extensive inspection.
The buyers have not failed their accountability, the court of court states in their judgment.
A terrible archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for Nazis in the register also for Finns.
In his recent Dagens Nyheter article, editor Christopher Andersson writes how the National Archive in Maryland, the United States, has documents stored for microfilms about a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finns, and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi Morsiam.
Documents and registration cards come from the Nazi-Deutsch Racial Agency.
The racial agency was under the authority of the SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been investigated by a SS doctor.
The same was true for even more women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynaecological studies were carried out in women to investigate it.
The racial agency examined the background of women, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's genealogy.
The women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Racial Agency handwritten life stories and good recommendations from the closest.
The racial agency wanted guarantees that women were "love children", "regulated," and "good national socialists", who knew very well German.
Women who failed to meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of SS men.
The case does not tell us what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the records of the archive.
The SS leaders created a programme supported by the State, known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme stipulated, inter alia, that each SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
The Lebensborn homes care for children born outside the marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, the pages of the US Holocaust Museum are reported.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged getting married by providing loans and supporting children.
A German mother’s court of honor was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the "Aryans" and non-Aryans were legally banned, and found on the sides of the museum.
Betrayer-Siren's sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Narkko was the third place in the first sailing of the Finnjolli day at the Rio Olympic Games, but the whole group remained at the second tail of the day.
Narkko rose in the overall situation after the eighth five departure, but the failure of the second departure dropped him in position 14.
Wind Beaster-Siren fought at the RS:X-class day leaving locations 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Betrayer-Siren is the sixth.
In the 470th class, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren remained at the beginning of the day 23.
The overall situation of Lindgrens is 19.
Jari Sillanpään Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours of sleep, "I was so stubborn."
Jari Sillanpää has been part of Finnish favorite artists for more than 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the tango king of 1995, the best sold solo artist in Finland, and the star of the dancing ships and festivals, Sillanö continues to pork and is at the moment viciously rising.
Mari Koplisen wrote a book about the life of the favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells of his life and career as well as in evil.
The career of the bridge head rose to a total rising cliff when he won the crown of the Tango King on the wall of the river Tango in 1995.
At the race, Sillanmama sang tanks, but she had already designed a little different music for herself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had written a tango piece to Sillanpää, at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinn song became one of the most popular pieces in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: the bridge head sang it on the tape in a terrible caterpillar and only a few hours after night dreams.
We had a party tonight.
I was so stubborn!
The bridge head remembers in the book.
You wouldn't expect it to be singing in a caterpillar immediately.
Although I wasn't physically on my best, the track was still good.
I learned that all the time there is no need to demand perfection and excellence.
A second incident related to the most popular pieces of man, mentioned in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner at that time and finally ended up in the texts of the Gold copy you deserve, which was published single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs that Sarah ordered from Cramp were not the same as Sillanpää would have wanted.
The bridge head had imagined making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song of the divorce were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the seven days magazine.
In the news of the newspaper, the reason for the difference between Jar and the ex-loving was Jar's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jar said that it was a full bunny, and it was not true.
According to the book, Jari made a call to the record company and refused to sing a song, but eventually, he ended up singing it, and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
At the end, 52% of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, although the opinion surveys of the voting week anticipate the opposite outcome.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in favour of staying in the EU.
None of the well-respected research institutes or university indicated the difference, although a couple of individual researchers may have disagreed with the mainstream of their professions.
The basic mantra of Western Policy, the former President of the United States, Bill Clinton, was the subjection "It's the Economy, the stupids" in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices weren't heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important issue of politics.
Economic Slinger
Centre for Macroeconomics in his latest monthly survey, from professionals to Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not heard because this time the voters made a decision on non-financial grounds.
One explanation by economists about the loss of the economic position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employed, which is almost constant.
If the immigrant gets a job, it's off the right British.
Many also have the idea that a depreciation of the currency would be a good thing, as it contributes to the export industry.
In the opinion of the economists, the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the unanimity of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, the equilibrium of the BBC gave them equal space to only a few per cent of the economists that support the EU gap as well as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hateful press was not interested in explaining what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE feels about the consequences of the difference.
These far-reaching book combinations spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the economist messages were listened and understood, they were not cared because economists represent an elite with which the voters in their opinion do not have common interests.
Academics like economists would have remained in the EU, but the message was not effective in small cities and rural areas.
Immigration is an economy.
The overwhelming triumph argument of the Brexit vote concerns immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will burst your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked out.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In each health centre's waiting room, you see immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical appointments if they weren't?
There are children of immigrants in each school.
How much easier would the real British children get a school place if they were to get rid of?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more space would the primitives have if they left?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond, and if they succeeded, their answers were not visible.
Economists have failed to explain that the British people have more jobs, less health centres and more money for education and social security thanks to immigrants.
Immigrants - and in particular EU immigrants - are net contributors of the UK government and their spending generates jobs.

One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are the responsibility of the Finnish Pertti Oldman.
He said that in Aberdeen, there was an early preparation for Brexit with plans A and B.
The plan B, which is the EU-segregating camp's victory, started to be prepared for more details a few weeks before the vote in case the result was over.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large amounts of liquid assets, but they could now be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on 23th, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, the old man says about the only open day in Aberdeen's nodebook fund that was covered by the news.
The old man said the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
The value of the Fund at that time was 3.5 billion pounds.
The total value of the company's funds is about 20 billion pounds.
It was the highest in nine open real estate funds, the Old One says about all real estate funds open to British real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at 10% or even below it.
Therefore, the real estate funds reserved for Brexit a wide range of strategies.
Funds closed trade
When a camp that supported the EU difference won, Europe was confused.
However, the few two weeks after the vote on the real estate market were quite calm, says Oldman.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney, the President of the Bank of England, who estimates that Brext could be at a high risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen his trade.
These together robbed the situation and brought it up to the main sections of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says the Old One.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and after each other, the fund had to close its door.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they didn't actually shut down the trade, they changed their pricing downwards.
In practice, the investors were given time to consider whether it would be worth taking the money out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you didn't have to take your money out now, it wouldn't be worth it, because it would cost you a loss.
It calmed the situation down, and most of them canceled the announcement.
Since then, it was quite even, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, the old one says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such decay in the Continental Europe Funds of Aberdeen.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
The old man felt that the closure of the real estate funds trade was disproportionately high.
The open funds for closures are controlled by about four per cent of the UK real estate.
Aberdeen’s closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its fund to the end of 2017.
At present, there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been downwards, but the situation does not look more "in the face of Aberdeen".
The main issues are now about the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought some of the real estate investors even new opportunities, the Old One points out.
The rate of the red and dollar is at the lowest for 30 years, and the market also has a 15% reduction compared to the time before the Brext vote.
The dollar looter can now buy the same property up to 30 per cent cheaper.
There's a lot of willing buyers, old man says.
Brexit brought mines to the London real estate market.
At 2:00 a.m., the situation didn't look so much.
But at 4:00 p.m., when Pertti, responsible for the real estate investment of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word of power.
I realized this is going to Plan B's side, old man says in his second home in Helsinki.
He was headed to work right away.
London City was already alive, despite the morning night.
The TV screens normally provided for silent at the office attracted the news, and usually the loud people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera to tell us about his divorce.
When the market opened, the evidence was flashing out of red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you'd live, old man says.
Not because, despite the wreckage, Aberdee, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, completed two real estate trades on the day following the Brext vote.
The mood was messed up.
However, the company had been well prepared for an alternative, and that is why the situation was kind of calm, says the Old One.
The Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership switched.
The market started to anticipate severe landings for the UK and London real estate market, in particular.
In London office facilities, up to 20% mines were anticipated in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze one after another.
Butdeen did that for six days too.
Now the turbulent has been depleted, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not see the last summer holidays on the face of Vanhaske in Helsinki this week.
He still thinks it is too early to say much about what Brexit follows.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been first-rated.
CBRE’s information on price developments covers about a third of the market.
According to them, prices for all real estates in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, the negative increased by 6.1 per cent, and the old one reads.
The figures aren't so bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months has been worse, says the Old One.
All equally large drops were hit in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, too, because Brexit was quickly compared with Lehman's fall and the global economic crisis that started on the US real estate market.
The old man believes that the parable is not quite right, because it is now the domestic crisis in Britain.
There's another mood, too.
The real estate market has now not seen a panic sales like that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Old Man.
There's a lot of funding that can be found normally.
In any case, the repair could have been in progress.
In fact, the price repair movement is not a miracle for him... that could have been the case without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, the prices of real estate in London and other world capitals have been too high for years.
For two years, we've been saying that the city and, in particular, the offices are overrated, says the Old One.
So the fall started very high.
London's prices have been upwards for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, and London’s population is also growing.
Another major trend is that real estates are the last ownership class that globalizes, says the Old One.
New players have been marketed in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for property investment sites abroad.
London is a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been increased by a low rate of interest, for example, where pension companies have been forced to seek income from new destinations.
In addition to this, the loan has been readily available, although, according to Vanhaske, the debt bump has now been used clearly less than during the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, disperse
In London, price increases ranked last summer, old man tells me.
Also Aberdeen started to reduce its ownership in London, and last year he was a net salesman.
There was some kind of turn to be expected, and now it came.
What do you want from now on?
It depends on how the British economy is evolving, says the Old One.
He's afraid he can't figure out what's going on, but he says there's hardly a promise to get up.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or even course ahead.
The old man has already seen more movements up and down as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And still he's a optimist who believes we can survive the hole by working.
If you are well prepared for risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, it's too much of a victim.
If it's dispersed, the risks are also decentralised, old man says.
The S group begins to register purchase information more closely than before
Soon the S Group knows what you are eating, because today the trading group has announced that it would start to collect more accurate information about the purchases of its main customers.
As far as data have been collected from the balance of the receipt, the group begins to grip on the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S group here comes after Kesko because the information on the goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to the CEO of K-Plus Oy, Ismo Riitala, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
The product-specific data shall be collected with the consent of the customer and shall be used with a licence for marketing.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
Pretty few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Economic Sanom.
He said Kesko is not going to react to the change in registration of the S group.
Kesko is already categorising its main customer according to only the food purchases to ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for the marketing targeted to the customer.
The product-specific purchase information is collected only from the K group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a Stamm Customer Programme, and there is no such thing as this.
Finland’s Middle Trade has its own One-Bonus Customer Programme, which can be associated with in Selection Houses, Siwomes and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we are not collecting product or product group data, we remain at the level of the final receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made, and that day, and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We haven't gone to that level like the K group or the S group, says the commercial leader Anu Ora.
He believes that the PSP will be reformed in the future, but the Middle Trade will talk about it later.
However, Ora does not allow the registration of product information.
Testing at first
The SOK Customer Owner and Customer Register has been relatively wide until now.
The basic information included not only personal and address information but also professional, educational, housing and childbirth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase date and time, the place, the final amount of the purchases and the way of payment have been recorded in the S-Independence Card purchase.
In addition, information from the S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, the product level purchase information will be deposited in Sokos and Emotion chains.
However, data are currently recorded at product group level in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terro and ABC chains.
Customers have had longer hopes that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owner and Partner Activities of SOK.
S Group says they're informing their customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data are recorded with bags in any case, wanted it or not.
The applicant may check the data deposited on the S group website.
For example, the cash registers are unable to access information, emphasised by Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is Tull's latest dog confirmation - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The baby of the black labrador is vigilantly sniffing five crates of similar lands in line at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long when it sits firmly next to the middle box.
The customs inspector Lassi Sunito rewards his dog Heila to play it with that favorite toy.
In the box next to which Heila was sitting, a bottle of crucible shelves were discovered.
Furniture gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Sunito, owner of the Heila dog.
Security and access conditions for online trade
Heila is the first dog specialised in the search for weapons and explosives in Tull and is placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Job assignments may also lead to other border crossing stations and ports when needed by Heila and Sunito.
However, the airport will be the main job in Heila, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in Customs, and the surveillance has been confirmed after the attacks, says Superintendent of Customs, Mikko Grönberg.
Secondly, postal broadcasts travelling through Helsinki-Vanta are the responsibility for training weapons and explosive dogs.
As a result of growing internet trade, up to 40 million posts are carried through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered abroad.
During the last few years, the customs authorities have made some 300 discoveries of online purchases, passenger baggage and air freight at Helsinki Airport, arms parts, ammunition and explosives, as well as their origins.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate registered baggage and mail.
In the future, it will have a great benefit when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Tulli estimates whether weapons and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg welcomes the idea.
School in the Church
The training of the Heila Pennus is coordinated by the Dog School of Tull in Kirkkoum.
Sunito also attends training with Heila at police and defence experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the defence forces' expertise in explosives.
Together with other authorities, the customs authorities decide what smells Heila is being taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues in Helsinki Airport have six drug dogs in Tull and a money and drug dog in Massi.
Heila, the labrador, has been elected from the ten puppies' puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog to be chosen at the airport include collision and hunting, as well as calmness, as the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human streams.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Without Heila, there's nowhere at home, Sunito's laughing.
Fine orders are going to Heila for a one-time liege.
The midnight-Sanom cameraman loses a fast dog's microwave, but Heila will return a soft toy cover immediately from the command "shoot".
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, which assesses whether training is sufficient for required tasks.
Heila can be seen at work in Helsinki Airport next half of the year if everything goes as planned.
Unfortunately, travellers cannot come to iron the working vests on the dog, reminds Sunito.
One working dog costs approximately EUR 60000 to 70000 per year for customs duties.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active workouts will only last from ten minutes to two hours.
The owner of the work dogs is a tough competition in Tull.
Heila's owner was picking up about 20-30 Customs employees.
Fortunately, Suntion was hit by someone who has never had a work dog before, but has years of experience with dogs and supervisors in Tull.
The Mini State has its first Olympic Medal - the people will have a day off
The Olympic Gold of Fiji, with less than a million inhabitants, in rugby, is so high in the country that the government has appointed the national day of August 22 for free.
According to the country’s broadcasting company, the Fiji government confirmed the issue after the mastership was solved.
The day off will be held on the team's returning home the next day.
The hero team is also allowed to celebrate in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated championship.
The Guardian says that the final in the country was followed in the capital of Suva, where a screen was set up for the stadium.
Normally only the native Fijis are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants, they watched the game, I heard them encourage, said Fiji Times reporter Mayele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish Adult fainted after a terrible performance
The printing player Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt for 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening quality as a lifter.
During or immediately after the lifting of the fines, he's fainted several times.
No one has ever been able to say why.
Tokola scored 1,75 pounds and 145 pounds of pace in Rio.
His result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last push of 1,75 pounds, as did the other one.
In the third attempt, the weights were rising as a grind of screaming.
The corpse would tremble under the weight until the judge's accepting the lift.
The joy of the finnish worshiper was frightened by the fact that he had suffered problems on his knees.
RoPS acquired an Estonian raider Prosan - Flagship - Evening Sanomas
The Rovaniemen Ball Society, who plays in the men's football League, has concluded a sustainable agreement with the Estonian league Albert Prosa.
We're looking for a team top player with power and a threshold for Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
More than 10 players agents and I went through over 50 players all over the world.
Prosa, Coach of RoPS, told Juha Maline in the newsletter, started to be a good option.
Prosa, 25, arrives to RoPS from a farmer in Flora, where he made 51 goals in 109 matches.
He's also played in the Estonian country team.
Prosan is supposed to be with RoPS on Saturday on the Wall River, where the Rovaniemians meet the master of the Finnish SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when Alexander Kokko, the earthly King of the last season, moved to Australia.
The Threat Modern Family Star reappears: Teenage shorts reveal almost everything
The Modern Family Comedy Series, which are nicely known as Alex Dunphyna, Ariel Winter, blasted again by presenting his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week at minishorts, who don't leave much of the imagination.
The Shorts revealed not only the artist's legs but also the back of this.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making its style and use much more bold.
The star has posed in the pictures published in the social media in very little clothes and taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressing in very short costumes.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it from here.
Previously this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his publicity picture so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter had a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He's been on TV almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashians.
He has learned that the more he shows the surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has aggravated some of his long-term fans with their imago movements.
It is not difficult to guess where he is in ten years, when the lowest thing is already so hard, says a woman in Winter's Instagram.
Instead, some of the women’s fans defend the actor and urge them to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what others say.
You're inspiring a lot of women, shaking a young woman.
The Japanese preferably want tourists from the Nordic countries to Finland attracted by revonts: In the autumn, it is possible to see the occasional Mirror urora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start retreating trips in the early autumn, Visit Finland says in the newsletter.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of the Japanese reconnaissance tourism.
The backlights are valve cards for our winter tourism and are closely connected with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
Lapland's winter retreats have a great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sale of autumn trips.
Few people know that the tranquilizer is starting from early autumn and continues far to spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called Mirror aurora, where the lake’s surface reflects revolving lights by making the vision of two multipliers of the occasional, says in the visit Finland’s newsletter, the marketing manager Anne Lind.
The main destinations of the Visit Finland revalidation campaign are wealthy 25-35 years old, Japanese women living in town dreaming of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things, by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by the Aalto University and researchers at the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique sightseeings from Finland, and this revonette has, according to Lind, a huge potential.
The overnight stays of Japanese tourists have grown considerably more than other Nordic countries in Finland.
Last year, they stayed over double more in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested as a target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
The Japanese average spent EUR 183 a day in Finland, says Lind.
The British welcomes the master course organised by Fid in rugbypole when leading to gold
The British impressive advance in the rugby tournament collapsed Fidz's last challenge at the Thursday night final, when the team experienced 43-7 crashes at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi arranged a master course in reading, chewing, evacuating, support game, running lines and silk when he won gold - their first Olympic medal.
The death was accompanied by a reasonable comfort from the silver militia - the third of the UK day - and they were proud of their hard work at the opening tournament of the Olympic rugby, with which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 wins of the semifinal previously played on the same day in South Africa could bother them in the final.
But in spite of this, Fidi would have won in this condition for a 15-person top-qualified team.
The fact that at least one Brit has a gold medal in his neck tomorrow is Ben Ryan, the former British boss of Wimbledon.
It's been quite a trip to Great Britain.
Eight years ago, when they were trained by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This backbone hurts, but it's a shocking development.
Fidi started excellently rejecting British tacks for fun.
To Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams, this was like they ran for moving buses, and world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in the corner of the target area.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwa's second touchdown right side led to a goal trap.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great tack was stopping the male mountain Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it was just a slow one for Fid.
Within seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu made the goal in the right corner, and the United Kingdom was losing 17-0.
Nakarawa again made a goal of a new initiative, and the watch was still over a minute... the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvouu snatched through the tacks found in Britain and went to the line to make a goal.
After the landing trip, the situation was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain only learned the game.
And that's actually how it is.
With a break, the United Kingdom made changes that block Fid's dam for four minutes, which was well compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova made the goal after Fid's impressive input game.
Dan Norton caught a goal for the United Kingdom when he made touchdown in the left corner and diverted to the number 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, shoved the tickets and danced in the viewings.
It was difficult not to admire Fid's thrilling approach.
Mata Viliame, last minute's goal, was a crust in Fid's cake, which didn't need to be loaded.
The bull was fed, the Fids hugged, and the United Kingdom fell on the lawn, completely beaten.
Previously on the same day Fidi had hit the Japanese semifinal 20-5, and the United Kingdom won South Africa in a tight semifinal, where both made one goal - the British goal strike solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the target area with a glorious footwork and painted under the paint pillows in the second half.
A magnificent late tack of Marcus Watson, England's 15th-stage rugby team from Anthony's brother, secured the victory and finally the silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer winged Helen Glower and Heather Stanning into the martial win.
These races will not have feelings of more devastating gold, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard racing towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagola.
Even though they were fighting with each other, there were three voices on the boat. Coach Robin Williams' echo was present all the time when the two of their second consecutive Olympiad in a couple of women's races - the first women in British sports history, which surpasses such achievements.
Their control was perfect, and this was the invincible of their 39th appearance, which is also remarkable.
This, what we see, is two great athletes joining the surface with a flexible spray, not a complete picture of the nature of victory.
A group of helpful pairs who gradually promote the things that are important, and no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would live until this day.
Like he said, the situation was a lot.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that could be cut, and they had surgery.
If they don't cut, it's spreading everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It'll change your way of thinking a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The triangle was lucky to be able to start his treatment at the beginning of 2014 outside the period when they caused as little disruption as possible - if that expression could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better fast.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked all over the department... 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Blowing in itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first two thoughts were Williams, who had had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nerves.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Afghan command of the royal artillery regiment, said, "I have been a tunnel this week, which may be a little overreacting, but this means so much to me."
It just highlights how important this is to me, how much I and Helen, and Robin, we have worked, too.
The past three years have been great with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he has great thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better trainee or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost the competition in five years.
A couple set a rough rhythm that their competitors didn't reach.
Even on the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in the warehouse.
We were very close in a moment.
Helen yelled "suspension in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we tried not to do anything special.
We didn't look for fireworks today, we're just trying to win a good fight and a race, and that's what we did.
A couple of years will wait until they decide their future.
Glover's gonna be on the wedding next month when he gets married to TV advisor Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was a Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
This is where it lasted about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland will change the government of Panama leaks
In October, Iceland will organise premature parliamentary elections, which will be demanded by the protesters who were raged by Panama's data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed tax avoided by several Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson divorced because of the scandal, but it wasn't enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to organise new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29th.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the recent rage of the people will affect the outcome of the elections in the autumn.
In June the presidential elections clearly showed criticism of the power-holders, and Gudni Johannesson, who had been elected outside the policy, was elected as President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he said Obama was the founder of Isisi.
The presidential candidate for the United States Republicans, Donald Trump, cancelled his latest speeches.
He said that he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting president Barack Obama would be the founder of Isisi's terrorist organization and a democratic candidate for the establishment of the Hillary Clinton organization.
The Democratic Party got mad at the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can fall down like that, Clinton's twit.
In Southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a moslim-favored burkin-swimming suit on the beaches, says among other things the British newspaper Guardia.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to beaches and swims for all who do not have a good habit and a secularist bathing suit.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which largely express religious links, can increase the risk of order disruption in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In the middle of July, 85 people died and hundreds of injured in Nice, when a 31 - year - old man drove to the French National Day of the People’s Party.
At the end of July, two extremists connected to Isisi attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of the bathing waters of Oulu penetrated the screen - the blue seam of the Lake of Fishing
Water samples taken from official bathing beaches in the Oulu area meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only bleaching seams have been observed on the bathing zone of the Lake Swimming Pool.
Over Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental activity of Oulu took water samples from nine EU shores in Oulu region and 30 other general bathing areas.
With the exception of the beach of Meriniemi, the concentrations of all bathing waters of E.coli and gastro-cocactic bacteria in the bathing zones were below the measures laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
E.coli and enterococococcus levels of the bathing zone of the sealine were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had decreased below the operating limits.
The blue sealing that was observed on the swimming pool of the lake does not yet make the water intact, but under favourable conditions, the situation can quickly become a blueberry snack, making the water a blueberry in the form of skirts.
Environmental action will monitor the situation with the most intensified inspections.
If the bluefin tuna becomes a blueberry, it will also be reported separately on the bathing zone reporting table.
Look at the results of the bathing water samples from here.
MTK Käkrainen Forest Gender Reduction: more than 80% of forest owners outside
The deduction of forests is one of the tax changes in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance for next year.
Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax for the generation exchange of forestry.
In the presentation by the Ministry of Finance of Forest Gender Reduction, there are four objectives: to promote generation exchanges of forest holdings, to younger age structures of forest owners, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the pure capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forestry farms is good, comment on Juha Käkrainen, head of the Central Union of Agriculture and Forest Producers (MTK).
However, it is deaf to find criticism in the proposed tax change.
Forest gift reductions are presented as a task of the pure capital income of the forest owner.
This is the capital income from which all other reductions have been deducted.
In the opinion of the MTK and Käkrainen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be higher if the reduction could be made directly from the profits of the tree.
The VM proposal is based on a reduction in the pure capital income of forestry by preventing the loss of the capital income of forestry which would be reduced by other taxation.
Such a person would benefit from tax, even if he did not sell a tree.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to figure it out, says Käkrainen.
In addition, the model concerns only a small part of forest owners.
The limit on tax reductions linked to the value of the forest is EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled up in Käkrainen's minds too high.
As such, he said that 82 percent of Finnish forest owners were removed from the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the border guarantees the purpose of the farming.
Forest policy has taken the deforestation to Käkraen for decades.
It is behind the ageing of the forest owners.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful rakecuro surprised the car drivers in Himanga... two cars swept into a stream and hit each other.
There was a special ride on the Kala River in the morning.
According to the rescue facility, two cars in successively driven were swept into their streams, after which the behind came in crashing after the predator.
According to Harri Pythti, the firefighter of a friend is suspected of a massive hauling of the stream.
Back in time there were two people in the car who were both transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more accurate information on their injuries.
The driver of the above-wheel car wasn't hurt.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 from Himanga, a few miles towards the Fish River.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings of the academic professor Johanna Ivaska study group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases cancer’s malignancy.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow in the usual way in such a environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of the cancer was prevented under laboratory conditions by replacing the cancer surrounding tissue to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study have been published on 4 August in the Nature Communications, a reviewed site in the field of cell biology.
The death of Muhoos' family continues in the court, the prosecution also demands a murder charge for another offender.
The death of the family of Muhoos continues in the court for both prisoners.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the death of a family home in Muhona.
One received 8 years of 4 months of murder and brutal robbery, including as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment for murder and brutal robbery committed as a young person.
The prisoner was also convicted of a serious threat to road safety as a young person and the transport of a vehicle as a young person.
The prosecutor, the prosecutors, the lawyers and the man who had a harder judgment.
The prosecution demands a lesser man to be sentenced for murder as a young person to be sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to the law, 17-year-old young people killed a man who worked as director of the child protection unit last year in July.
The 17-year-old who was sentenced to murder attacked the director on the couch of the living room.
The director had been able to get rid of it and brought the young man into his room when one of the young ones hit him with a vacuum tube.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to the mind study, both judges were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape the family home at least since the day before.
The ice shark is the longest spine in the world, growing only at the age of 156
The longest living backbone in the world has been confirmed by the ice shark, says a research published in the Science magazine.
In the northern part of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark swimming around Greenland, that is, the holger can live up to 400 years old.
The female grows only at the age of 156.
I iced my life. It only grows a centimetre a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than icefish.
Scientists found age by radio carbide.
Because of the nuclear experiments in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
They suggest that researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
For the age of the oldest, 392 years were estimated, but the throwing in the direction or the other could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump Economics - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the world.
Even a third of all the tax revenues of the State would not be received if the change in the corporate tax carried out by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also decrease in particular with the most profitable tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax programme as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
Business tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without collecting a really great amount, $1,000 a year.
The higher income tax rate is now 39.6, after the reduction proposed by Trump 33.
They'd give up the inheritance tax.
Trump blamed the State for excessive regulation of the business and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The agreed environmental standards must be reintroduced and the energy regulation should be decommited.
The reform of Barack Obama's health care needs to be dealt with.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
The "destructive" trade policy is, according to Trump, the major causes of the US problems.
Free trade agreements would be renounced.
For importation from China, 45% would be disrupted and for Mexico a fine tax of 35%.
We offer you a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our belief, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American aeroplanes will combine cities, American ships to control seas, American steel to raise new clouds throughout the country.
By contrast, Trump read the speech written by the assistants loyally, even though well organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those close to the Republicans, see that the Trump programme will take the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton published his program early on Friday in Finland.
An attack wave of the past - People's News
The sea is mourning fateously, but the actual wave of attack strikes in the middle of Madrid's street fountain -- accounting with the past can begin.
There's a focus on Pedro Almodóvar's news story.
The previous management work of Almodovar Travel lovers (2013) was a little fun and a satirious comedy in the middle of the past, where I live (2011) as a Spanish pioneer.
Likely, Juliet (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a contemporary love, human relationship and family drama with a mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and we'll see a lot of it as a long backbone.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to fall.
A new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) must be marvelous at the end of the movie.
In the form of a back and long letter, Juliet once the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
He began from the time before the daughter was born, the moment when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julietata as a young teacher is rising from Adraina Ugarte, a TV-suited series between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's ageing has been handled in a way that can be considered as a cake, but I would say that it is timely and literally with a single wipe.
For Almodóvar films, often, there is a fair distance to such a characteristic sensitivity in the sense of humor in Julieta.
It is a flat-rated, restrained film with good music in a place and a rather sad film, which contains ingredients of its election.
Instead, the typical visual discolouration of the Spanish director is maintained and begins to inject a little quietly into the eye more in a clean form than as an active dramatic means of action.
People in films experience diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains the same Korean.
This applies in particular to the costume: in the case of a name person, the costumes change from the scene to the other, and the same applies to the visible ears.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main point is that the impact is not particularly improved.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly breathless.
Almodóvar has written a script on the basis of three novels of the Canadian Alice Munro, rewarded by Nobel 2013.
The novels have been published in the work of the Floor: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly balanced written literature filming.
The material would have been emotionally unlike the steepest drama, the great things that the film deals with, especially the bleak guilt.
Control and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
In the main sections: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
It's 12.8 film pre-night.
Government tries elections - People's News
There are no new cuts to be made, the ministers say, so that the basic Finns do not collapse totally.
However, the surgeries decided in the spring are made with a robbery.
There will be no new surgery.
The four billion savings already decided will be sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centric) and Minister of Finance, Petter Orpo (Kok.) under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that the VM proposal does not contain any new cuts, since the cuts of social security were already decided in the spring framework.
Children's allowance, national pensions, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the population pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of unemployment security is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training surgery continues.
Rehabilitation is haunted
Why are the ministers so hard to emphasise that no further cuts are made on them?
Because next year is the year of election.
The municipalities will be held in April and are the most important heat meter in the electoral term, not the gallus.
It has been seen before that the fitness outcome of the government parties in different directions will ruin the government's mood for a long time.
However, the Gallups tell us that the Government Party's fundamental Finns are waiting for a blowdown, although the result of its previous elections was modest, compared to the parliamentary elections, 12.3 per cent.
Four years ago, the main Finns received 752 new authorised persons, many of whom will be realised at the cost of influence in the right government next spring.
The life line of the government of about equally large three parties is in the reserve that the position of the main Finns endures.
It has not been lasting now, but more than half of the parties voted in favour of government policy already during the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visits have also come to the surface.
Firstly, the new cuts will not come to light the fact that they will be done hard next year and the second attempt is to soften the expected attack on the main Finns.
Great surgery in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different - if the government of Sipilah is still standing up.
The government has set its goal to change the debt in this parliamentary period, but the budget proposal by Petter Orpo will take EUR 5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipalities, the government has two options.
The first is to put hands up in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: the debt is not slowed or even slowed down.
The other one is to keep up with the program.
This means new, even harder cuts in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would at least be drawn close to balance during 2018 and then, in the spring, the elections will be taken against what will come.
With these measures, the debt is unfavourable.
It is absolutely clear that the current measures do not change the debt, even though Juha Sipila is trying to squeeze a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäen at the information meeting at the budget are unreasonable:
World economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no support from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except in the context of a temporary recovery policy at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent over this decade, with an average length of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment will now cost EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
In the course of the week, public debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, rises to 70% in the mid-term of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt-recovery submitted by the Left Union was rejected as it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about EUR 6 billion, which is practically fully covered by new debts.
This is the idea of the centre, the meeting and the fundamental Finns of what is responsible.
Question: A lot of tasks are left to the municipalities
Three out of four believe that the organisation of child day care, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, it appears from the study of the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people is also responsible for the individual community for libraries, culture, civil schools, construction supervision, high school training and waste management.
The country's responsibility will be more determined by the country's co-operation, specialised hospitals, vocational training, higher education schools and the institution care of disabled people.
No responsibilities under the responsibility of the municipalities are to be transferred to the State.
A low-aged ride was running after the chase, running away from the police.
A 16 - year - old motorcycler, Joensuu, drove a police force to escape at Joensuu Ilomantsi on Friday night at half a time.
The police team tried to stop the motorcycle without lights, but the young man went to drive the police away from a fair speed.
The rear drive continued to the Sinkajanrantway, from which the Sorronahontee and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
After this, the young man ran away, but a faster policeman ran after the fugitive.
The ventilation test for the driver showed 0.75 promilles.
Nor did he have a driving licence that would have justified driving on a motorcycle.
The case is examined, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock cargo fell into a stream
The truck in the rock cargo crashed on the Polvi lake at 9:15 a.m. on Thursday night at the Caveyard.
The truck had driven out of the road and crashed on his side of the stream in the left corner.
The rescue facility lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door, together with the rescue helicopter's staff and the first caregivers.
The car owner was responsible for raising the vehicle.
From the straped truck, hydraulic oil flowed on the road, which was absorbed by the rescue plant.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon at the Air River.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in the Lahden village of the Lahden River in South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about 165 centimetres long, shiny and delicious with hair that reaches the white chin.
The findings and tips of the missing movements are requested to call the northern situation centre reference number 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air... see the gallery of the ruins of Parafest.
The parafest festival's tents have been knocked down by a burst flow causing massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be able to get on its feet financially, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last performer of the Parafest, Kalle Salonen, appeared on a torso after Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances held at the urban theatre premises from 13 a.m.
The art center in Ahjo is the Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme is scheduled.
The flow of flutters occurs in the cloud when the rainwater and its weight start the decreasing flow of air.
Changes in the water form of the cloud bind the heat, so the decreasing atmosphere cools and speeds towards the ground.
It is reported from the aeronautics Institute that in Finland, in several summers, crash flows occur.
It's hard to predict the path of the flash flows.
On Friday afternoon, before the fiveth, the event site of Parafest was hit by the collision flow at the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum.
Three tents fell into reversal with a total of 200 people in the tents.
In an accident, four people were mildly insulted.
There was one child in the group who was carried to further treatment with mildly injured.
Air pollution obsolete Londoners
According to the study, the Londoner skin grows faster than usual.
The reason for the skin's ageing is air pollution.
The British research reports Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than the agemate in the countryside.
Small particles of the skin are very fine dust pollutants from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases that, according to Evening Standard, are killed by nearly 9 500 Londoners every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who travel their business trips in the vicious streets.
London’s residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with masks, but regular skin cleaning is recommended as a more practical solution.
Traktor's brakes failed to push the man standing in front.
The man had moved stones in his yard circle with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to walk in front of it, the tractor’s brakes failed and the tractor turned on the man.
The man did not get under it, but the tractor was able to push the man so much that he was transported to the central hospital as he was seriously injured.
The tractor didn't make it further because it hit the stones in front of him.
Discourse to the newest force in the future
The Riverman Gaga-Riento, playing in the Balloon Championship, departs from a better set of starting in October than a male memory.
The team's been together for three weeks.
The common line is certainly better found than in the previous periods when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisu, who continues as the head coach of the Rieno, commends the new team for enterprise and unity.
From a foreign triangle, Fred Muson is starting his second period in Rieno.
The new faces are the 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson from the Rwanda country team is a 205 centimeter hacker.
Garchet is a passport, the Brazilian has 198 cents.
Through Josha, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. Country Team
Anne Partneren has played in almost all the gym clubs since 2003.
Now Tampere is already on its sixth race, only 2013 was missed since Canada was better in North America.
I was working in Turku and playing with those women when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a salibandy country team.
I'm interested, and here we are, Partner, 48, says.
A partner was born in 1967 in Elizabeth, near New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987, the partnership was able to study data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, a species like that hasn't yet been played at the SM level like a gym bandy.
They played a flash at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in the River Boys hockey in the SM series, partner remembers.
The partner played with the University in the Salibady SM series during the period 1991-92, the following three of them went through Josba.
In addition to playing, she trained the company A girls for the championship.
The SM series of women culminated in silver in 1995.
Totally, the partner played in the SM series of women through the 10th series, in 169 matches 51+34=85.
The latest SM season is 2001-2002.
Pertus Puska and Tatu Vääänen were named for the country team
Josban of the Joensuu Salibandy Society was raised by Perttu Puska and the enzootic Tatu Vääänen was selected as part of the Finnish rural team, which plays at the Tscheki Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In Helsinki, the 25-year-old Pertus Puska, attacking the Era, has played before this six men's landings, where he has a total of 9+4=13 power points.
The 32-year-old defender of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen Tatu Väääänen has recovered from the tramp and belongs to the country team's standard fish with 117 landings experience.
Mika Kohonen was also appointed to the rural team in the Seinäjoki game player, who was seen in the Finnish shirt last December in the MM race.
The main coach of the Salibandian team is Petri Kettunen, the Gulf of Contio.
The Beach volley artist Essi Hasu circle closes to Kouvola - the SM Gold is missing in the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is going to end as a beach volley player, at least after a temporary period.
Beach volley Finnish Championships will be solved this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
For three days, the medals are played in both adults and young people's series.
In cooperation with the SM final tournament organised by the Kouvola Airball players and the Finnish Airball Association, the six best pairs in each series are eligible.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elissi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Now Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to the lookout this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the Pesisstadion.
I haven't played in adult shows so often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in finals in home corners, Hasu mood.
Kouvola’s area lit Hasu into sports and gave her a good meal for a fancy hobby.
There are good memories of childhood.
When I was nine, I started a balloon at E-girls at Elimäe NMKY.
The top of the mind is too large to play shirts, knees around the ankles, ashes and choreographs after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small place, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's common spirit created a environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were closely involved... with the teammate's father coached us, and our mother was the leader of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was a natural type choice for the counterweight of the balloon.
The swimming pool of the nest sheep has been playing songs since the 1990s.
Action has always been active.
I also went to follow the Juniors' SM Tour, thinking that someday I'd be there to play.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays this weekend together with Annina Parkkinen in the SM-finals.
After the Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahde, the goal of the second dual that has been punished for the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We're still missing a SM-Good, and Hasu throws it mysteriously.
The event of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last of Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges in civil work are awaiting.
Yes, the international career is over after the tournament at the Rivalcallio.
By the way, the toes are put in the nail, at least temporarily, hasu is planning.

Solomon’s Koli boldly left as a farmer
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means taking risks, sweating and vigorousness.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future in rural areas too.
Shortly two years ago, Coli, together with his little brother, Valter Kol, began working as a rebel to their home.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and counsels brothers with their own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking debts and increasing orders so that the bread could become hand-in-hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to go to the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think we have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a pieton water, and the bank was not interested either at first.
However, I myself have been very boldly involved in the project, and I have been fully involved, Solomon Koli tells and adds that he would not have taken action if he had not believed in producing a pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The goal of Solomon Kol, who grows meat cars, is to invest in even bigger beans.
The work has resulted because Solomon’s Koli has been chosen to be among the best ten in the competition of the young food producer of the Earth’s Future magazine.
At best, he's competing for a possible win.
He'll be able to vote on the web page of the magazine until 21.8.
Bulgaria first reports inflation to eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading for years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after October of last year, when positive 0.2% was announced.
The average annual inflation measured in the cost index was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost index of life in July 2016 was 101.0 % compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate at the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, the price of the following consumer goods was increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7 %), transport (1.8 %), free time and culture (6.3 %), restaurants and hotels (1.2 %), mixed goods and services (0.3 %).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2 %), furniture, household supplies and routine (0,5 %), health (0.1 %).
The prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat's "anime" efficiency is judged as an Asian Karikatthar.
According to Snapchat, anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its Linsic tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to transform reality and to play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into an ananas, dog or character that would fit for the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
Linsen are simple, face - shaped tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All the misleading steps end quickly in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have been previously criticised by the accusation that the application advertises blackface or "black face" mask or prefers to whiten the skin color as a beauty apple.
So when Snapchat advertised some of the users this week, who gave them snared eyes, squirrel teeth and pussy cheeks, some critics called it a racist chalice of Asian people - the "green face" or yellowface.
And they wonder if these repeated poems could be a sign of the company’s larger problem regarding diversity.
News and worsening spread on Wednesday with the reports of The Verge and Motherboard, the day later Snapchat said that he lost his character.
The company offered an explanation: Linssi was meant to honor anime people, not as a chalicature for Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of the offensive stereotypes of activity.
The other said no to anime comparison.
Grace Spapani, a Korean-American Art Student, whose twittet from photos was widely distributed, said in his e-mail that the lens was "serious and uncomfortable at least".
He added that "it's hard to argue against a comparison with the most brutal Asian carikat type and the filters' effects".
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow spot, but a yellow face taken to extreme humiliation.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be trapped in endless struggles with diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And the crowd of young people who are more versatile than their parents, Snapchat, may mean that they are even more likely to expect a understanding attitude.
In the interview on Thursday, the 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of the Snapchat lenses creates an insult to the user, it is much more difficult for these guys to be ignorant.
On Thursday, Zhu, the head of products and engineer working for the media, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to the Media and the telephone interview, he said that he believed that the conflicts related to the race reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s remuneration practices.
Zhu judged the company mainly with white men's leadership and decided to write with the Hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (# ExpireSnapchat)
"Even if they do not have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have representatives of different skin colors working, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share his views, a complaint that Snapchat has largely failed to reply.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, bearing in mind its status as a private enterprise.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ratifications of his staff, but according to the representative, the company hired the recruiter to focus on the underrepresented populations and to move forward internal integration efforts.
For his part, Zhu said that he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: "Is it so that they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay?"
According to the Congress Panel, the military officers distorted Isis intelligence.
In a report published on Thursday, the Congress Panel said from the Headquarters of the United States Armed Forces, the intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against Isisi in Iraq and Syria than what was justified on the ground.
In the mid-year report of the working group set up by the Head of the Defence Forces Committee of the House of Representatives, the Republican Chairman, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee for Defence Defence Sub-Committee, the "development of dissatisfaction" was found among the Headquarters of the Headquarters who said that they were evaluating the efforts of the Americans to win Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the Headquarters of the Military Command in Tampa, Florida, which supervises US Armed Force Operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of the intelligence accepted by the more valuable Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of the anti-terrorism efforts of the United States than the facts at the scene justified; they were regularly more positive than the analyses produced by other investigators in the intelligence community," said the press release.
"Centcom's events are impossible to accept - our fighters are suffering when bad analyses are presented to high-level decision-makers," said Mr Ken Calvert, my California Republican.
The failures of Centcom's leadership reach the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the constant problems of the headquarters’ descriptions and analyses of the US’s efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence of the fact that the high administrative authorities of the Obama regime have prescribed reports for thumb, it describes analysts' feeling that Centcom leaders would have put pressure on them to picture the threat of the Islamic State, Isisisi.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and certificates of the headquarters for the Congress were much more positive than the events themselves," said the report.
For example, the Centcom Authority publicly stated that a major attack to take Mosul back could begin even early as in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in possession of Isisi.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," said Mr Pompeo, Mr Kansas Republican, in the statement.
From mid-2015 to mid-2015, the highest investigators of the United States Armed Forces Headquarters manipulated the headquarters's intelligence output to reduce Isisi's threat in Iraq.
After consulting the group, the Republicans created that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence on the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday follows more extensive results during the investigation.
The supervisor of the Ministry of Defence has started an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom's intelligence.
Democracy members of the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with the final conclusions of some of the Republican Working Group.
"In the period 2014-2015, the Centcom created an overly isolated process on the intelligence assessment of Isisi and the Iraqi security forces," said Mr Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's leading Democrat, in the opinion.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the release of scouts", deteriorating the mood among analysts, and not "providing sufficient space for different perspectives".
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find any evidence that the White House would have tried to press the Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusion to the "pre-introduced or political story".
The Daily Beast reported the preliminary results of the Congress's investigation on Tuesday.
In August last, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon supervisor has started an investigation following the complaints of Centcom's analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in the statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress report as long as the supervisor's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a sound dialogue on these essential issues of national security".
The study has other post-mortem consequences than just as to whether the bombing measures led by the United States in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on the headquarters to deliver honest assessments of the wars of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
The inquiry criticism of the Islamic State reflects more than a decade ago, when the Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that despite the objections of several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small army in Iraq and took very little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker was also a key role in the revolt regarding intelligence from the Islamic State.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, air strikes against the refineries controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly undermined the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
From the Centcom bridges the commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticised last year after many legislators held his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive estimate of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins the fourth time in successive women's country hockey, organizing a discussion with Britain
The day after he had made three goals for the team when he won Japan 6-1, Katie Bam made the American Women's Country hockey team on Thursday the first two goals when Americans won India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds unforgettable, but the 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a book of his paintings."
But he knows this: the Americans are in a 4-0 situation in the Olympic tournament, and they share the first position of their group with the United Kingdom, which was still incredibly incredibly defeated on Thursday, Japan's 2-0.
Great Britain and the United States meet the first round in the last game on Saturday.
Both teams have survived the quarter round, and this game determines who is first and who is second to their six teams in their group.
The first place to avoid a strong Dutch, the leader of the second group, is a little longer at the beginning of the quarters.
Whatever Saturday's game ends, the Americans have woke up with their surprising success here, four years after they remained the last of 12 teams in the Olympics in London.
Bam was in that team.
He grew up in the Blue Bell of Pennsylvania and picked up a land hockey eagle for the first time when he was three years old (who his parents played the species in Drexel) when he was 16 years old, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the Olympics in 2008 because he was unable to join the final player list.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, the British Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same time in London as we have now.
We've made a complete translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half of his painting on a cramp near the goal.
India had come into the game with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly hard and kept the situation in 1-0 readings until the end of the third batch, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left of the field, then rolled in the middle and pulled the ball into the goal, taking the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added a fourth round in the middle of the final goal.
This zero game was the first one of the United States goal guard Jackie Briggs, who had given one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
The Peace of Trampoliin in the midst of the Olympics
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are in progress.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable message of vigorous competition and effort.
It's as if the Olympiasm ward itself is a flame-fighting messenger transmitted from a bowl shooter to a swimmer and a gymnast to a triathlonist.
It is impossible to put on television, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of a sewer in the line of the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hatred holding between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first time of the Olympics and the future heartbreaker with a smile, could well be one of the names of all who are presented to the best viewing time and who are in favour of the sponsorship contracts and the TV ads of a good mind - if he were a swimmer, a gymnastic or even a swordmaster.
But Dooley 28, from the Lake Forest of California, competes for the Olympic Gold in the trampoline.
The Olympic League doesn't illuminate all species as much.
Far from the center, partly in the shadow, are the species that are not generally accepted by everyone: air pistol shooting, bowl shooting, feather balloon, taekwondo.
We always have breast-feed, long to live.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special favourites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been the Olympic species since 2000, when it made its first performance in Sydney’s races, the presence of trampoline in the past 16 years is so small that many of the interviewed did not realize it was the Olympic species at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletics to compete in the species, it has never won the medal in it, and its athlete has not progressed to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share the medals of men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, the Chinese Dong Dong and the Canadian Rosie McLennan are defending their London gold medal.
Trampoline, however, is accompanied by a certain kind of underdog's charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for a clown school than for the Olympics.
Here I have to admit I'm not an expert, I'm just an incompetent fan.
The species have opportunities for fun, as is observed from the color of the infinite pumps of the drawing films, but also the spongeness of gymnastics and swimshops, two species that in principle combine.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a ponyboard.
The championship seekers jumped with a giant trampoline up to almost 30 ft, and they must perform cliff series (transverses, skills and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympics programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio there are 32 sportsmen from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those wishing for the medal must go looking for the gold to go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes backwards around the field.
They are not just hunting a target line or an opening wall, but also, on television news, on a second graceful frontier: world or Olympic performance.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatic - and it can even get a viewer to tears.
But that is also the reason why even watching the races can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline offers a rest here.
Trampolin's heading up.
The aim is not to move forward.
The rival rises to a new rise, making it seem weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then troublelessly up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but there is no aggression towards the end of the program, no jumps from far away, just a dreamful, melting interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to the Zen space as the Olympics can get away with.
Women's racing contests and then the final will be held Friday afternoon at the beginning of the broadcast at 13 (ET), men's races will also come on Saturday at 13.
NBC will send finals as part of its afternoon software from 14 a.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympia drug, they offer a quiet, charming moment, most likely not to be noticed in general chaos.
And if consciousness is only achieved by offering male athletes to be stared and artifacted (such as the United States male opponents suggested the Wall Street Journal some time ago), Dooley is just waiting for their new fan.
"The generation shows its mind" in Ethiopia, a long-term ally to the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
The protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced the violent opposition of the government.
The witnesses say that tens of demonstrators have been shot to death in collisions with the police.
Ethiopia breaking?
During the last decade, it has been one of the most stable African states, a strong ally in the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
However, in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country as it spreads to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people went to the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to the human rights groups, the government's response was pathetic.
The witnesses said that the police shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Disseminated videos, recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be at the end of last year or beginning of this year, show how security authorities strike young people at the same time as they were forced to stand against the wall.
The United Nations General Human Rights Authority now calls for a transparent study.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, project leader of the African horn, in the International Crisis Group study group.
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is the second most populous country in Africa, and the Western countries appreciate its stability.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in combating terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and barely any African country receives so much assistance from the western countries.
The Ethiopia economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Abeba has even a new train for business travellers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, despite the fact that Ethiopia has not been a model for democracy, human rights organisations have continued to talk about government oppression, the opposition of the country has been limited and the dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far to the desert.
But this may change.
"If you suppress people and they have no choice but to show their minds, this will happen," said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth shows its mind.
One generation shows his mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover the strangulation of the power of the coalition that dominates the use of the earth.
After many critical elections last year, the governing party and its allies received the last place held by the opposition and now holds all the seats of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border against Eritrea grow. The battle across this tensioned and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts are afraid that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated over the past years, can try to take advantage of the burst and rearm.
Many factors explain why, after years of decay, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first seems to be seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only over the last few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, when cheaper smartphones have spread and the Internet service has improved.
Even if the government closed access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still send messages through the intermediaries of the location.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups of Ethiopia, oroms and amharas, are better able to work together.
Oroms and amhars aren't natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharans, who come mainly from the Christians in Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business by taking advantage of oroms, many of whom are Muslims and who live in a hole.
But this, too, is changing.
"We are on our way to organize under one parachute," said Mulatu Gemechu, director of the Orom.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the amhara and oromal areas.
Many amharas and oroms think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre people. The population covers about 6% of the population and controls armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of disturbation is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, former head of rebels, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors in making opponents harmless.
"Northic administration has no basic instinct like that," said the conflictanalyst Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the North Ethiopia Tigre region, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that the safety services controlled by the Tigers do not trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increasing bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia was in the power of such a desolation in 2005, when thousands of people showed their minds about elections that, according to analysts, seemed to be the first to crawl and then robbed by the government.
In a follow-up intensive attack, many demonstrators died, although less than in the past months, and that period of disturbation passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for a visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new work road train, and considerable progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly, this has not stopped the impression of the Ethiopia government within the country.
And now it's starting to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the city of Amhara in Gandar attacked companies owned by tigers, and hate against Tigre becomes increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations put the United States and other Western Alliances in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights in Somalia, a neighbouring country, although it said some time ago that it closed this base.
Although the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they do not want their allies in the insecure region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "There's real balance."
Donald Trump explains his obama base-father claim as "sarcasms"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his last campaign to conquer his dispute on Friday, claiming that he was not serious when he this week many times inspired that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "basers" of the Islamic terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly with the American public.
It also set up his defendant, who have been struggling to defend him during the stormy period, in a difficult position in which they must explain comments that he does not necessarily mean.
After the insinuation at the Wednesday evening campaign meeting, Trump expressed the same ever more enthusiastic in the Thursday interviews, where he inspired that his purpose was to say that President and Clinton created Isisi.
But at the early Friday morning Twitter release Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a complete change from the day before, when Trump said that in several interviews he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When Hugh Hewitt, a Conservative Radio Promotionist, tried to help the Trumps to draw up their comments by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took this in his hearing ears.
The latest review storm will come in a situation where Trump has attempted to refocus his campaign in the midst of the results of the opinion studies.
Trump and Clinton fought this week about the economy in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
I fled to Twitter again, he warned me that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump's used sarcasm defense before.
Later in July, after he encountered a wide criticism when he suggested that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comments by saying "I am sarcastic, I am sure."
The approach enables Trump to go to the limits of political speech and then return, if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He sees how they work and then "clears" in the direction or other depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is attractive to his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through several lenses.
Instead of reducing his speeches for a large audience of votes, Trump has been more shattered in the last few days when his favor has continued to land.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Trump is going after Clinton a significant amount in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump, in principle, tries to avoid apology for provoking things, he often blames his critics for misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
When he faces a closer look at the presidential election campaign in the last few months, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal ally into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him, regardless of how provocative his remarks are.
The former Mayor of New York Rudolph W. Giulian, one of the most prominent supporters of Trump, worked hard to defend the candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe that his words have real, political comments," said Giuliani when asked him about the reality of the claim of Trump, which Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was close to unknown, a small organisation he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most Republicans are trying to claim that the Government of Obama, where Clinton worked as a foreign minister, allowed Isisi to get worse because it failed to manage the situation effectively in the Middle East.
Before the Friday meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack on Twitter towards the news media, which roamed his every word and are neutral against him.
He mocked the "ass, pathetic" television experts who try to find out about him, saying, "They won't succeed!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s excuse for a new proof that he was inappropriate as President.
Previously closed coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
Verb Café was a rhetorical, cash-accepting place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but he offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, Bedford Avenue's street yard was too expensive for it.
The shop that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soap-shaped soaps in the form of cupcake.
The locals were frustrating it as the latest loss in the middle - class senate city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is devastated and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also a re-introduction.
In November last, the revitalised Verb opened up to Greenpoint, less than a mile from his original location.
The new verb has a Wi-Fi and can be paid on credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there is the same unfair atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term worker in the old cafeteria, who is the owner and director of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, he kept a lot of things.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of an old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
In the food room there are pecon-cane egg cheese sandwiches, and on the ceilings there are, for example, cabbages and brushed onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
There's no more beer in the cafeteria, but there's fresh juice.
In nine months, Rodriguez says that he has noticed a constant current of old Stamm Customers.
"Williamsburg became too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One of the last Sundays Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and visited Verb regularly.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he went to the cafeteria.
He says that after Verb shut down, he gave up coffee drinks for a second.
"I realized I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to the coffee, even though that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of a regular ice coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb loyally since 2003.
He used to go there before work, and he always made the same order.
"Every day, fifteen more than seven, regular as clock, I went in, and they were making spices in my bagelia butter," he said.
Photo, Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients on the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still does his regular order, but sometimes because of the variation, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't wear a grudge on a soap shop that took over the old farms.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special seal for Verb to use as an ingredient of the refrigerated coffee from the cafeteria.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also approved the cafeteria.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to put it up soon to something to make his new neighbor welcome.
The new place has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell chilled coffee.
It is possible that the cafeteria will expand to the building next door.
For many customers, it's enough for them to have their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a last client and said he was untrustful when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he came home walking in and ordering coffee.
"I needed to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Lamaying food
In March 1933, soon after the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat to eat lunch in his office.
President Roosevelt loved delicious Fifth Avenue food, such as a goose-paste, and Maryland's turtle turtle.
On that day his diet was more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato salt, and dessert from the puff.
"It was an expression of culinary solidarity for people suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights is a food historian.
The latest book of Coe, Chop Suey, reported Chinese food in America, and Zeigelman reported his life through the Lower East Side floor in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest cooperation, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food in the 1930s in the great recession.
By showing some kind of culinary solidarity, they meet the supplier at the dinner Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unrecognised lunch bar in the Fletiron region, which has been active since the breakdown of the stock exchange in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose with turkey, potato sugar and vegetables.
When the supplier ordered meat cream, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss the period of lama.
"The worries were very popular," Zeigelman said.
There was peanut muffins, liver murmurs, popcorn.
They were made of the ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they would form your dinner.
Coe's laughing.
"It must have felt like a lead gravity in the stomach," he said.
Years before the fall on the American tables, especially in the countryside, was like eating-nine-ballion-as-jaxat-nout table.
Women’s groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. The Square Meal book chronized the ways the nation survived that suddenly it was no longer a country of superiority.
"That food became a central, harassing topic for the Americans," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The same anxious was a new, affordable diet: Mystery dishes, such as crustaceans and boxes, became the main foods, and the box was "a great way to use food stars," said Zeigelman, because the cooks were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the centre of American meals for years, became a luxuriously administered product.
Special compositions were experimented with the amount of calories and nutrient content more important than taste or even healthy reason in the kitchen.
In carrying out the study, Zeigelman also prepared an acoustical food with peanut beans filled in for a book containing receptacles.
"It wasn't a popular addition to his dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
The peanut butter is in no way suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household specialists, such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Agency in 1923-1943, had more control of the country’s food habits than ever before or after.
In the newspapers and magazines of the publications, they encouraged women to start to become "budgets" and respond to the challenge of converting molluscs like spaghetti and carrots into tasted doses.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical flavors.
The reports of government responses to hungry citizens are particularly delicious, as President Herbert Hoover will allow me to eat your cake weapons.
At the same time, when he publicly praised his child’s simple, iowa-based earthly food, he is eating like a refined millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tux in the almost golden dining room.
He was the great one out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example in his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "not only offered food from the most ducks in Washington, but also the hardest prepared food."
Many of the lamanal dishes were rejected as soon as the land returned to its feet.
As a success, we continue to focus on calories and nutrition, Zeigelman said, and in the manner of how science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they gained a better understanding of the manner of eating Ziegelman’s mother, such as how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," said Coe.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even sickened people."
There's been a windshield incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert that they had prepared at home — the pruning food that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"That's called pneumonia", Zegelman said, adding that the general trick was to give the modest recipes a name.
There was no cream wax in the dessert, just puffs, a little flour, sugar, water and cane.
All of them unwillingly drowned their spoons into their sticky, brown lester.
Surprised it wasn't bad.
Coe's got one and another.
Speaking of a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "A little snatched German nuts could help."
Gilead will be reimbursed attorney expenses in the Hepatitis C Battle against Merck
The U.S. United States' filing commissioner has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the legal expenses it incurred in the case of hepatitis C patient, Merck & Co Inc, a drug manufacturer.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million payments after breaking two Merck patents related to Gilead’s success medicines in Sovaldi and Harvoni. This release followed the discovery of Merck’s abuses, including false oaths and other unethical practices.
On Thursday, the United States may not have the right to be freed from the compensation that Gilead had in opposition to the claim.
Merck is trying to capture Gilead, who controls the market in a new generation of anti-hepatitis C medicines, which can clearly improve over 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case of law runs until 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for the ownership of the laboratory work on the basis of sofosbuvir.
The U.S. armed forces say that the Manbij under Isisi has completely conquered
The U.S. armed forces have completely conquered the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border since the last remaining Isis fighters left town, the representative of the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hidden in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 wings prisoners who were held prisoners, from the Sharfan Darwish SDF alliance, from the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now under our control, but we have started to investigate it," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 per cent of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax statement showing that the income of the democratic presidential candidate and his spouse in that year was $10.75 million and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organisations, mainly to Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $ 5.3 million to speaker compensation, and the former foreign minister announced that he had received 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster in his library, which told him his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia with his wife Anne Holton, published 10-year tax declarations.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the standard for economic transparency," said Jennifer Palmier, Clinton's campaign assistant.
In sharp contrast with this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises of publishing his tax declarations.
According to the practice, US presidential candidates will publish their tax declarations, even if the law does not oblige it.
The New Yorker businessman Trump and his lawyers have called on the tax administration's audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax declarations.
"Your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, said on Twitter, publishing a link to the tax announcements of a democratic candidate.
Thursday, Mr. Trump's special assistant Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were ready.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business and many other links to Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken the problem of publishing a web video on Friday, which brought up visible Republicans who urge the Trumps to publish their taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in the last decades has done: he published his tax declaration," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very few taxes in two 1990s, and the New York Times business column lent a number of tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, who said that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax percentages have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than a million dollars a year deserves a tax of at least 30%.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, last week Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said that he also has a tax administration's audit, and that Trump is not a "frightened" tax collecting agency, but a voter.
The Clinton campaign has published tax notifications until 2007.
Today, the real federal rate of Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined rate was about 40,5 per cent.
Clinton's tax statement from 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from salaries, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a cheap, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported dividends and interest income for $100,000.

Chili powder condoms and telegrams enhance the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Nature protectors in Tanzania use an unusual means of preventing elephants from wandering to human locations, they throw animals in condoms filled with chili powder.
Keino has proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation invented several years ago, together with the United States Nature Conservancy, has improved its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use four steps in protecting homes and hundreds without the animals being injured.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the day of the world's elephant, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed... tools, we have found a change in attitude in these communities, and they now have much more confidence in keeping the elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Damian Bell, the Executive Director of the Honeyguis.
The first two steps keep showing an invasive elephant with a flashlight and a horn playing.
If it doesn't stop the animal, we'll throw the so-called "chilipil" thing.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and ground and with a tear, then the condom is circulated so that only the lighting wire is visible.
When the condom is ignified, it breaks out with a breeze and squeezes the chili powder into the air.
One smell is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last way to do is a launcher shooting a Roman candle in the air, which produces a loud, clear explosion.
RT news: A Jewish filmmaker criticizes the Berlin Hotel that removed Israel's direction number at the request of the Arabs
A French, Jewish filmmaker released a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list the Israeli direction. According to the worker, this is due to the 'questions' of the Arabians.
Claude Lanzmann, who wrote a copy of the holocaust, was frustrated to the Berlin Hotel Kempinski Bristol, writing an open letter in a German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann attempted to find the Israeli hotel in a list of country guide numbers.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel was removed and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through his own telephone centre.
When the filmmaker was looking for an explanation, he talked about it at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer from there was "suddened by him".
The hotel receptor said it was a thoughtful decision for the management of the Campinski Hotels.
The reason behind the decision caused even more shock on the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they call for Israel to be removed," says the employee, according to Lanzmann.
Israel's German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "the great injustice", Zudeutsche Zeitung reported.
"We were terrified and shocked because of the case.
It is already a great injustice in itself.
But even more shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need any explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a counteract online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "responded" to the alleged demands of the Arabians.
"Fuck" was said in another publication, which noted that a hotel in Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself disputed all the charges quickly and called it "unaccurateness" and "apologized" Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"This command not to include Israel in the fast selection list was never done," Kempinski's representative has said, according to Suddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the reference number has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubbers against Brazilian students
On Thursday, the students joined the police in Sao Paulo, Brazil, when the students gathered to show their minds against the reforms of the government’s public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubbers against protesters.
Problems began when lawkeepers tried to dismantle the student force, leading to the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their fear of plans.
According to Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, governor of the State of Sao Paolo, fewer than 100 public schools would be closed and 300 000 students would be relocated to save money.
Some of those involved in the demonstration were seen writing graphics against the temporary President Michel Temer on the walls.
This last demonstration was only taking place days after the protestants left as a group to support the arrested President Dilma Rousseff during the vote of the country senate on his prosecution.
RT business: trade between Russia and Iran is suddenly increasing by 71%
Since the withdrawal of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Teheran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagarya.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been abolished, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in transactions in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing links to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Normally, one of the most important objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is the expansion of trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015, as a total of EUR 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5% as a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 per cent to USD 158 million.
The Ambassador said, "The growth was achieved by the supply of machines, vehicles and weapons."
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects this year a record of Iranian tourists to Russia.
Last year, in Iran, the Russian Foreign Representatives Department granted about 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also for the first time among the 20 countries most tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that the record of the Iranianists last year in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have kept the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scotch Callum Skinner hit the goal when the British hit a bike gold
At the men's teamprint at Rio's bike stadium last night, a threesome of the British team defended his championship from London from 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy, the legend was proud of the young man, when this met the pre-famous winner of the New Zealand team.
Great Britain took the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they reiterated the trick with modestly investing in the sixth March Railway World Championships in London, even though Hoy has decided to compete since then.
The problem between Beijing and London's races was the replacement of Special Sender Jamie Staff.
This could be done just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's end also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill in.
Skinner was the man from whom British coaches held in line with the potential of the Scotland, which has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner made the Olympics performance at the time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British three won a duel for gold.
After his own round, Hindes was quite behind, but Kenny stabbed the team, and Skinner kept it.
Strategic change was a major part of the transformation, and it included Hindes’ driving on a major turn to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to hold on to the steering lines.
Hoy followed his position as an expert in the BBC and pointed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes to the attention of them when they entered the prize level.
The 23-year-old Glasgowiner Skinner said, "Breaking is flattering."
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
In the final, we made a Olympic performance and won world champions.
It was amazing.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London 2012 along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrawn his comments, and British competitors have not complained.
This time there was no similar problem with overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "I felt when I was in London when there were so many British flags on the foot."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world fairs, so the victory of the Olympic Games is simply marvelous.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven out of ten bike species in Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will be expected to be successful for five days in the cycling stadium.
On the basis of Kenny’s properness, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy’s dazzle, the victory of three Olympics in the Olympics.
It would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (when it appears to be on a sacred day in British sport, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), would rise to six gold and one silver.
It's like Hoy's.
Kenny's next competing for a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoy this one.
The team race is always the best.
We'll win it together with our friends.
Winning alone is honestly lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the value of a knight."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doul were the fastest four-mile, four-mile-mile team drive.
Their time was 3:51:943.
In London 2012, the world record wins gold is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had a fight with the judges last night before time when the officials invited him to the long-term measurement.
In the corresponding women’s competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavine Katie Archibald went forward at the time of the world record at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its mighty motorcycle team will take over the middle of the Olympics and achieve the medals of the whole group.
After presenting truly extraordinary and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before Rio’s races.
The background has been a drama, the least of which have not been the divorce of the technical leader, Shane Sutton, in April due to sexualism and temptations, and the end of the competition career of major individuals, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first-night competitions in the cycling stadium, it seems that the legendary reputation of the UK is now rising at the perfect moment of its peak.
The future of Portland’s melting is questionable due to the cut-off of the electricity contract
The future of Portland Victoria's aluminium beam, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when the electricity company that distributes electricity to the factory revealed that one of the owners of the factory is ending a distribution contract, so the cut of all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows the previous decision of the Victorian administration this year that the aid required for the maintenance of the plant will not be extended.
The 20-year aid period ends in November.
Even 2000 jobs can be at risk in the Alcoa Portland factory.
Even 2000 jobs can be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
Moreover, the snowball effect may be possible, as the melting uses about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melt, leading to the closing of Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa Portland melts loses money and is under lockdown.
The measure now follows a number of years of speculation on the future of the plant, which began with a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the cost of production of the plant.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium valley in the Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it would also expect three other owners to decide their agreement.
Most of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Maruben Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL awaits the continued operation of the Portland plant, which means that the physical need for the melting will continue," he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are the so-called 'protection agreements' which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month notice and therefore end in 2017.
"That is why AGL expects contracts to produce results in the year 2017," the electricity company said.
All possible results for AGL from the financial year 2018 are currently limited by the strong prospects of the future electricity market for wholesale prices.
AGL said that it has already reduced the value of contracts by a "predict of conclusion" by $187 million in its accounting.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate contracts "does not affect Alcoa ... the ability to keep melting in operation or to secure the melting electricity supply".
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the agreement had to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why the agreement was withdrawn.
The analysts have been alerted to both the portland melt in Victoria and the possible closure of the Tomago factory near Newcastle because the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Previously at week AGL Director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If both plants leave the market, this is a significant reduction in the demand for [electric] markets.
For us as an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just the true-tv star of the Kardashians, is on the cover of the Vogue of September.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner Clan's fourth daughter, is on the cover of the United States Vogue's desired September number.
Kendall, a brand-general of Estee Lauder and modeled in Milan, Paris and New York fashions, announced the news on Thursday with his Instagram account.
"Looking at this deck in a room full of loved people made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The adventure was followed by a unique (or perhaps only in the Kardashians style?), a handwritten reality video with the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and with the favorite entertainment of all, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot the cover of his sister, but which ended in the classical turn: they designed a surprise party.
This is a cliché of almost every "birthday season" of children's television series (Seacrest says the words "I didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning-shaped puzzle), but Kris had to get his other girls somehow to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved to a new Kardashian era with the place of Vogue in September.
Kendall's iso-sister Kim may have reached Vogue's case first (when he divided it with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in its own class.
Vogue's September number is the most sold edition throughout the year.
Its thickness is more like the coffee protocol than the fashion sheet, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion decreased that 615 of the 832 pages of the last year were advertising content).
The discovery of the cover is expected so keenly that for the last two years the pictures of the paper have been leaked before official publication.
Previous women on cover have been among other things Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
Indeed, in recent years there have been more "publics that act as models" than "models that are celebrities".
The Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador, Jennifer Lawrence, were in charge in 2013, the year after Lady Gaga's honorary place.
But if it happened that Jenner, described by the magazine as a "rescue model", would hit his first category, he is quite in good association.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or today's young people who can do a good Snapchat video (but Jenner is all this).
They are rightly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
Last year Beyonce’s cover model has been one of the strongest years of her career as a result of Lemonade’s publication.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner’s success.
In his true TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the mother of this moment".
This feeling again rose with Jenner's Vogue.
But in dissatisfaction, spinning is unreasonable.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the Vogue September issue.
He's a super model in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's make-up cream.
He and all his sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their own applications behind the payment wall.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who he took to the LOVE.
And in his free time, maybe just to see his sister, Kourtney, and her children, he's a true-tv star.
Community legal centres turn away 160 000 people annually
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people will be withdrawn from the Community's legal centres each year when the sector is preparing for the impact of additional financial cuts on its activities at the extreme borders.
In Queensland, three of the five people - mainly older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance to fight unfair extortions and similars - are already being turned away in their search for legal advice and representation.
The legal services already stretched to the external borders of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres will have to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, the head of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that, according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
"The Community legal centres in Queensland are chronicly subfined, which means that every year thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippled debts, families in displaced dwellings, unequivocally divorced workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
The federal government cuts funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable people in Queensland are forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government made its promise to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community Judicial Centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuki Government must invest in this important work.
The Donald Trump campaign was sued after the employee was claimed to be threatened with a weapon.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was challenged for the claim that they did nothing after they were told that the head of the campaign in North Carolina threatened the employee in February when they were driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in the case of the state campaign of former programme trainer Vincent Bordin, which was raised on Wednesday at the state court in Charlotte.
He said that he waited months for the situation to be handled internally before he realized that "not to happen."
Chief Earl Phillip, "she took out a pistol, put his right finger on the trigger and pushed him up against Vincent's kneeslide," he said on the cover.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other persons had had similar experience with Phillip, said in the complaint.
"You don't have to trigger any cases to cause damage," said the Bordini in the case.
The challenge will only come two days after the Republican president's candidate has caused anger in telling the public in North Carolina that "the second increase of people" - which usually covers the arms owners and armors - could take action if his competitor, Hillary Clinton, were elected and had to choose judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his word off the context and that he is not in favour of violence.
The challenge of Bordin is to seek compensation from the campaign for negligent control and for violence, abuse and emotional shock from Phillip.
Mr Hicks, representative of Trump, did not respond immediately to the request for comments.
It's not possible for companies to reach Phillip.
WCCB, local newsgirl Charlote, reports Phillip has recently left the campaign.
His consultant's call for Innovative Consulting Service was not immediately answered.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump campaign has been a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini against Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow is bringing recovery and dripping all over the stomach, not just to local communities and across London.
For myself, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was the attraction of the London 2012 races, when we saw a huge effort to ensure that all our peoples and regions benefit from the races.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits for Stratford and East End.
And we will do that again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only local communities are created with 10,000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs, and youth unemployment is eliminated around the airport.
As before the London races in 2012, some will think that the challenge for the extension of Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the races and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're gonna be wrong about Heathrow.
The obstacles must always be overcome, but Heathrow will answer any question that is being asked to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many people, not just for few people.
Enlargement is the possibility of creating up to 180 000 new jobs and the growth of GBP 211 billion, leaving the heritage of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented 11 billion in the time and budget of the infrastructure investment programme, with the T5, which has been voted for the world's best airport terminal in five years in successively, in T2, which was built between the two most urgent runways of the world.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, supported by 16 billion pounds of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow is also a success.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a heritage of skills and employment, for which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse games to prevent advertising
For companies who receive money from online advertising, companies are "cat and mouse toy", said one of the companies preparing such a program.
Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertising inhibitors from using their computer pages, Adblock Plus published a blog writing, which said that users could update the software filters to prevent re ads on social network websites.
Tuesday Facebook said that the code of its websites is exchanged around advertising so that it would be more difficult to find out which parts of the page are advertising.
But now Adblock says it's turned around a new code.
In a blog, Adblock's representative Ben Williams wrote that "the way forward battle between the community that prevents open-source advertising and its tourers has been running since the idea of blocking advertising," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon figure out its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of the great pain that commercialists have become for industry.
Globally, about 200 million people use advertising inhibitors, reported in the last year's study of Pagefair and Adobe, which is almost four times the amount that used these programmes in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook with mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenues.
However, the company is behind advertising inhibitors of the websites used on the computer, as mobile advertising inhibitors do not operate on Facebook's mobile access to the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer adverts are still bringing enough revenue to Facebook considers this kind of action worth investing.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said that it would update its "advertising" tool to give people more power on how to target advertising to them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that the new filters of Adblock were worrying, as they would also prevent part of the site's non-promotional content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," the Facebook representative said in an email statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, and that is why we have focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Apparently, she got under a car on a Swiss highway because of her suicide.
The victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway.
The police are looking for witnesses after a woman remained on the highway under several vehicles on Thursdays in an early hour, apparently suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in Vaud's office just after midnight on Thursday.
A woman made a "unwanted act" and stood in the dark on a road where several vehicles were hit, the Vaud police said in the statement.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who hit several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the event have already been questioned, but not all have been identified yet, the police told them that they were appealing to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident.
The crime investigation has been launched, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genève.
"But stay to see if any of the involved drivers are charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It's gonna be settled by the D.A.," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that the drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases, where both of them had a person walking on a dark highway, it was estimated that the drivers can't expect to meet a pedestrian on a motorway in the middle of the night, the paper said.
Last year, the police were released from the charges for the death loss after he hit and killed a man lying near Paynerne on the A! road one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had gone off the road, the court was told.
The Court noted that a police officer responding to an emergency call was driving in a reasoned manner, and that the presence of a man on the road was "indifferent and unpredictable", the judge said.
Anyone who has information on the Thursday case near Morges must call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus had to live once
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was likely to be once resident.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for examining the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the heat, the waterless surfaces and the filling of CO2 with the atmosphere could sometimes have been the same conditions as the earth.
Scientists have previously presented that the slow speed of rotation of Venus explains its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthly atmosphere, and it could still have run slowly.
The model also looked at the surface formation of the early Venus.
The planet was likely to have more dry areas than the Earth, but once there was sufficient water and geographical variations to enable life and to protect the water from rapid evacuation.
The advantage of the early Venus was also 30 percent lower than the sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun of the day for almost two months," GISS's researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in the news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer that works as a parachute, protecting the surface of the sun for a large part of the heat.
The final result is that the average temperatures of the climate are actually a few degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a story of Venus' development that was similar to what the planet researchers had expected before.
Although Venus was likely to be living sometimes, he was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over a number of billions of years.
Its oceans disappeared and its water steams burned in ultraviolet light.
When it escaped, the only thing left is a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gases, Venus, which we know today.
Researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy's giving up the plague of Avalanche's coach.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the activities of the Colorado Avalanche coach and the Vice-President of hockey affairs, i.e. the reason for the lack of influence in the decision-making process.
The Vice-President/CEO of Colorado, Joe Sakic, confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have done my duty as the Vice-President of the Colorado Avalanche hockey affairs and as the principal coach with enthusiasm, passion and determination," Roy, 50 years old, said in the statement.
During the summer, I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth that it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the opinion of the coach and the Vice-President of hockey affairs should be fully in line with the organisation's view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him happiness in the future.
Roy was appointed to receive the Jack Adams Award award to the best coach of the league in the first Avalanche period 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and to the victory of the middle division, but Minnesota fell in the first round of the Colorado drops, and the team has not continued in the last two years.
Avalanchen's games in the period 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 gaming games, and the team lost by five points to Wild, losing the wild card location of the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame's chosen goal guard Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
The North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone the strike
Working fights against oil workers in the North Sea for wage are postponed when all parties in the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
Lacks against Wood Group have been occasionally organised by the North Sea drills led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMTs can confirm that we have agreed to reopen the process to resolve the current dispute," read the joint opinion.
In the next few weeks, we will hold several whole-day meetings early next week, so that we can get a fresh lookout problem.
According to trade unions, their recent work fights, which they say are the first in over 25 years, were a objection to potential, up to 30% pay cuts.
This year, the Wood Group cut the North Sea contractors' fees by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company’s fee reduction will result in a reduction of 10% by contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the necessary space to survive the downturn of the market.
Shell, in turn, has reduced thousands of people on their wages and announced their plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries when the company reduces its activities as a result of its gigantic merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower prices of crude oil, and this economic situation is worsened by the British June decision to leave the European Union.
The Scottish Member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with allies earlier this week to discuss one generation's biggest work disputes in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the economy of the region.
"We need a economy that works for many people, not just for few people, in the North Sea and the whole country," he said in the statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than USD 1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, whereas the average of the previous five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Plejad Star Force
The most recent Kepler space telescope task has helped astronomers to collect the most complete list of Stars of Plejadians in the speeds of the stars.
New information helps astronomers to understand why the stars of the astronomer rotate at variable speeds, and how circular times relate to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other astronomers, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of the solar system," said the researcher Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Pasadena Centre, Caltech's infrared procession and analysis in the press release
The Plejadians are located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars have been born about 125 million years ago and are now reaching adulthood.
They're rolling at their top level now.
With the peak speed, these grown-up stars are dropping large amounts from the astronomer wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
When the star grows old, the speed of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of each star by following the appearance of identifiable stars, such as sunlights.
The list of last stars’ rotation speeds suggests that the larger stars rotate more slowly than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger ones make pirates slower than the smaller.
"In the "ballet" of the games, we see that the slight wheelers are usually more massive, while the fastest wheelers are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Plejadians are so close, it is ideal for the cosmic laboratory to evaluate the stars' characteristics at rotation rates.
"Plejad's Star Force offers an anchoring stars for theoretical models, which cover both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why the stars slow down their spinning speed and, so called, hang their "dancing chin" nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Plejad’s rounding rates in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
