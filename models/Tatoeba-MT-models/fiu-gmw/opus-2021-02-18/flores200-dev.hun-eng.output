Stars release light and heat while hydrogen atoms are combining (or fusionising) and thus creating harder chemical elements.
Scientists work on a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem that can be solved, and it can take years to build useful fusion reactors.
Due to the surface voltage, the steel plunger floats on the top of the water.
Surface voltage is created because water molecules on the surface of the water attract each other more than the air molecules above them attract them.
Water molecules form an invisible skin on the surface of the water allowing objects such as needles to float on the surface of the water.
There is a sandy hollow between the two edges of the modern sleeve. The two wings allow you to maintain better ice, even in a position.
Since the blade’s bottom is slightly bended as the blade is still on one side or on the other side, the life of the ice is also bended.
This causes the turn of the skateboard. If the slides fall to the right, then the skateboard turns to the right, and if the slides fall left, then the skateboard turns to the left.
"Measure energy" from not extra energy."
This is achieved by the release of a small particle called photon.
"The scientists call this process "stimulated radiation emissions" because atoms are stimulated by strong light, which causes light photon emissions, and light is a kind of radiation."
The picture below shows the atoms that produce photons. Of course, the photons are much smaller in reality than they can see in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than atomic materials!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filaments of the lamp are finally burned out, and its lights will not work.
Then the gloss should be replaced. We should be careful when changing the glow.

The blood flows from the heart in a vein called arterias, and comes back there in tubes called venes. The smallest are called hair fibers.
The teeth of the Triceratops were able to chew not only the leaves but also the very hard branches and roots.
According to some scientists, Triceratops had a cyclic palm, which was a wide-ranging plant in the Crete.
These plants are similar to small palm trees, sharp and stabbing corona.
Triceratops could have used the strong tube to remove the leaves before they consume the tribe.
Other scientists argued that these plants are extremely toxic, so it is unlikely that dinosaurs consumed them, despite the fact that varnishes and other animals, such as papayas (as descendants of dinosaurs) consume poisonous leaves or fruits today.
How would the gravity of Io affect me? If you were on the surface of the Io, you'd be less than on Earth.
The person on earth weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) would weigh Ion 36 pounds (16 kg). So gravity, of course, will affect you less.
The sun does not have a barrel that can be placed on Earth. The sun is made up of gases, fires and plasma.
The gas becomes thiner as we get away from the center of the sun.
For the sun, we call it the outer part of it a photosphere, which means “light ball”.
Approximately 3,000 years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer observed that Venus had phases like the moon.
The stages emerge because the side of Venus (or the Moon) is only lighting towards the Sun. The stages of Venus supported Copernicus's theory of planets circulating around the sun.
Then a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks observed one of Venus' transgressions.

There are a number of theories about the formation of Sanskrit. One of them is the theory of migration from a west to India, according to which their members brought this language.
Sanskrit is one of the ancient languages, many are similar to European Latin.
The world’s first known book was written in Sanskrit, but after the creation of the upanisads, the Sanskrit became meaningless because of hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which is the basis of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the basis of European languages, such as French or Spanish.
After the battle against France, Germany began to prepare for the attack on the British Island.
Germany gave the code name of the attack “Operation of the Oroslan Fox” and most of the heavy armed arms and equipment of the British army lost when they evacuated from Dunkir, so the army was quite weak.
However, the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (‘Kriegsmarine’) and would have been able to destroy any invasive marine body crossing the La Manchester Canal.
At the same time, only very few ships of the Royal Navy stayed near the likely attack route, as the seamen feared that they would sink as a result of German air attacks.
"Let's explain with one explanation of the plans of Italy, Italy was primarily Germany and Japan's "brother."
He had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although just four new ships were built before the war began.
Italy's main goal was African countries, and to take these countries' troops would need a starting base to get through the Mediterranean Sea and to get Africa out.
So they had to get rid of the British bases and the ships in Egypt, except for these operations, Italian warships had no other task.
As for Japan, Japan is an island country, as is Britain.
Sea submarines are designed for underwater transport and long-term underwater stay.
They used submarines during World War I and World War II. They were very slow at the time, and their range of shooting was very limited.
At the beginning of the war, submarines typically travelled on the surface of the sea, but as radar surveys became more and more evolved and accurate, they were forced to fall under the water without notice.
German submarines were simply called U-Boat. Germans gained extraordinary skills in the navigation and operation of submarines.
As a result of their success with submarines, after the war, the Germans were not allowed to hold a lot of them.
Yes, Tutanhamon, who sometimes is referred to as "King Tut" or "King of Children", is now one of the most well-known ancient Egyptian kings.

Another famous Greek is the mathematical Pitagoras, mostly known for the link between the triangle sides of the rectangle.
There are different estimates of how many people in the world speak Hindi. It is estimated that this is the second-fourth most common language in the world.
The number of native speakers depends on whether they account for very similar dialects.
The number of language speakers is estimated to be between 340 million and 500 million, and about 800 million of those who understand.
Hindi and Urdu language vocabulary are similar, but their writing is different. During the daily conversation, the two speakers generally understand each other.

3% of the territory of Turkey is located in the European part of Turkey (Ocean-Thracia or Rumelia on the Balkan peninsula).
Turkey's territory is more than 1600 km (1000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide and is approximately similar to a brick base.
Turkey’s territory, including lakes, is 783 562 square kilometres (300 948 square miles), of which 755 688 square kilometres (291 773 square miles) are in southwest Asia and 23 764 square kilometres (9174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey’s territory is the 37th largest country in the world, which corresponds to around the metropolitan common area of France and the United Kingdom.
Turkey is bound by the sea from three sides: the Egean Sea in the West, the Black Sea in the north, and the Mediterranean in the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence begins in 1839.
Some of Belgium's current parts were part of Luxembourg in the past, but after the Belgian Revolution of 1830 became Belgian territory.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but Germany was obsessed with both World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization we know today as the European Union.
Dzong Dzong Drukg is a ruined fortress and a Buddhist monastery in the top of the town of Paro (in the village of Phondey).
They believe that the fortress was built in Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyga in 1649 as a memory of the victory against the Tibetan Mongol army.
As a result of a fire in 1951, there were few left of the Dzong Reliquies of Dzong, such as Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgy.
After the fire, the fortress was thus preserved and protected by one of Bhutan’s most sensational attractions.

The development of interactive media requires generally accepted and traditional skills and the use of interactive clock tools (concept scenario, sound and image editing, history story, etc.).
Interactive planning presupposes reassessment of media production assumptions and gaining non-linear thinking.
The interactive design requires the joining of the components of a project, while they must also stand as an independent entity.
The objective disadvantage of the zoom is that the number of lenses required to achieve focus complexity and focus distance is much higher than that of the fixed lighting distance.
This is becoming an increasingly important problem, as lens manufacturers are getting more and more results in lens production.
This allowed the lenses to be interconnected to create images of the quality that can be achieved with fixed focus lenses.
Another disadvantage of the zoom is that the maximum opening of the objectives (closure time) is generally low.
Therefore, the cheap zoom objectives are difficult to use with weak lighting conditions without vaku.
One of the most common problems with converting films into DVD format is overpaid.
Most televisions are designed to meet the needs of the general public.
So everything you see on TV was cut down, top and side.
This helps to cover the entire screen.
Unfortunately, when we make a DVD, the edges are likely to be cut off, and if the inscription is too close to the bottom edge, it won't look completely.
The traditional medieval castle has long been encouraging imagination, duel, lakomas, and ritualism of Arthur's age.
Although we are among thousands of years of ruins, we can easily recall the voices and smells of past battles, almost hear the knocking of streams on cat stones, and feel the smell of fear from the castle.
But is our imagination based on reality? First of all, why have they built castles? How have they been designed and built?
The characteristic of the era is that the castle of Kirby Muxloe is more a fortified house than a real castle.
Big glass walls and thin walls would not have been able to resist a determined attack for a long time.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began to build, the country was relatively peaceful, and it was only necessary to defend against the robbers in the disguise.
The system of balanced balances was a system in which European nations sought to preserve the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The concept was that all European nations had to prevent a certain nation from becoming a powerful power, and that is why national governments have often replaced their allies to maintain balance.
The Spanish succession war was the first war that focused on power balance.
This meant an important milestone, because European powers have no longer fought on a religious basis, so the thirty-year war can be considered the last religious war.
The church of Artemis in Ephesus Kr.e. was destroyed on July 21, 356, as a result of the burning of Herostratus.
According to the story, his purpose was to gain fame at any price. The disgraced Ephesians banned the name of Herostratos.

Indus Valley civilization was a bronzcore civilization in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, which included most of today's Pakistan and some of India's northwestern regions and the northeastern part of Afghanistan.
Civilization has flown in the river Indus, where his name came from.
Although some scientists believe that since civilisation existed in the already dried Sarsvati rivers, it should be called Indus-Sarrazvati civilization, while others, after the first digging area discovered in the 1920s, would call it Harappa civilization.
The militarism of the Roman Empire has helped the development of medicine.
The doctors began to use Emperor Augustus, and he was even the one who created the first Roman medical body to deal with the poster effects of the battles.
Chirurgens are familiar with various sedatives, including morphine from mast extract and scopolamine from the seeds of the organisms.
Amputation has acquired experience to protect patients from coupling, towers and arterial blockades to help facilitate blood flow.
Throughout the centuries, the Roman Empire has achieved significant results in the field of medicine, and today it has developed a large part of our knowledge.
Pureland origami is an origami where the limit, according to which only one drive can be carried out at the same time, is more complex repetitions than the re-engine is not allowed and all drives have a clear location.

"The lack of attention is a neurological syndrome with a classic symptomatic trim of pulse, anxiety, hyperactivity or excessive energy levels."
This is not a learning disorder, it is a learning disorder; “3-5 percent of children are affected by almost 2 million children in America.”
Children in ADD can hardly focus on things such as school work, but they can pay attention to enjoyable things, such as play, watch favourite cartoons, or write sentences without centralization.
These children often get into trouble because they “behave themselves risky, they fight and rebelle against authority, ” in order to stimulate their brains, as they cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
ADHD affects relationships with their partners because other children do not understand why they behave in the same way or why their level of maturity is different.
Since the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn has changed as described above, the speed of obtaining knowledge has changed.
The approach to information was different. The emphasis was no longer on recalling individual memories, but on the ability to respond to the text.
Overall, Renaissance has made a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other major mammals, human mammals no longer use their hands in the flow of places, loads or trees.
The chimpanzee's hands and legs are similar to the size and length, reflecting the hand's load carrier function during a walk based on the wrist.
Human hands are shorter than legs, with even fingers.
Fossile hand bones between two and three million years reveal changes in the specialization of hands from movement to manipulation.
Some believe that common artificially created conscious dreams can be extremely burdensome.
The main cause of this phenomenon is the result of the prolongation of clean dreams between REM conditions.
The rhythm of the REM cycle (which is the condition when we are actually asleep and our body is regenerating) can become more and more a problem.
It's just as exhausting as you're getting up on TV every 20 or thirty minutes.
The effect depends on how many times the brain attempts to dream consciously every night.

Tourists can visit the different designs of a country or decide to focus on a single area.
In view of this activity, colonists also asked for reinforcement.
Among the predetermined positions were the John Stark and James Reed Colonels controlled by 200 people 1 and 2 New Hampshire thousand (there were both generals later).
Stark's men took their jobs along the northern fence of colonists.
When the low level of water was opened along the Mystic River in the northeastern part of the peninsula, a short stone wall quickly extended the fence north to end it on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a armor about 100 feet (30 m) from the fence and ordered no one to fire until the soldier was gone.
The American Plan was based on a coordinated attack from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder is launching a distraction against the Bordentown British police to block the path of possible reinforcements.
General James Ewing would cross the river with 700 civil guards at Trenton Ferry, occupying the Assunpink Creek bridge, preventing the escape of hostile troops.
The main attack force of 2400 people would pass through the river, nine miles from Trenton, will be divided into two groups: one under Greene, the other under the control of Sullivan, to attack before dawn.
When running from a quarter-mile distance to a half-mile distance, speed will become less important, but endurance will be essential.
Of course, a first-class, half-mile person who runs in two minutes must have the right speed, but he must definitely develop resilience.
The best preparation for the run season is a little field run in the winter and exercise the upper body.
Good nutrition alone does not presume significant performance, but it can significantly affect the general well-being of young athletes.
Understanding healthy energy finances, understanding the various aspects of effective hydraulic practices and supplementary diets can help to improve the performance of athletes and improve the enjoyment of sports.
The medium-term run is a relatively cheap sport, but there are a couple of misleading beliefs about some pieces of equipment needed for the coagulation.
Products can be purchased as necessary, but most have no or no real effect on performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even if it does not provide real benefits.
The nucleus is considered to be one of the basic elements of each substance.
It is a very complex unit that, according to the simplified Bohr model, consists of a central cell core and circulating electrons around it, similar to the planets circulating around the sun - see Figure 1.1.
Nuclear seed consists of two elements of protons and neutrons.
The protons have positive electric charge, while the neutrons have no charge, electrons are negative electrical charged.
Before examining the victim, measure the location first in order to ensure its own safety.
During approach, you must monitor the victim's situation and any possible warning signs.
If you get hurt when you're trying to help, it's just making it worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and horror vision were involved in the relationship between pain and disability in patients with pain.
Weekly regular, systematic exercises of physical activity have only affected the effects of the increase in pain, not the effects of depression and fear.
Participants in regular activities needed more support for the negative perception of pain to distinguish chronic pain from the discomfort caused by normal physical movement.
Sensitivity or visibility depends on the senses of the visual system or the eyes.
There are various structured eyes with variable complexity, depending on the needs of the body.
The different structures are equipped with different capabilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and their sharpness vary, the increase of their input sensitivity requires a different way of processing and their number is different for optimal operation.
The population is a collection of the organisms of a particular species in a specific geographical area.
If every member of a population agrees with a certain phenotypic characteristic, we call them monomorph.
It's called a polymorph when individuals show several versions of a particular property.
The colonies of migratory hangers are moving and nesting at different stages.
At the nomad stage, the soldiers are walking at night and camping in the day.
The colony enters the nomad phase when the amount of food available drops. At this stage, the colony produces temporary nests that are changed every day.
Each of these nomad's bursts and ends lasts about 17 days.
"What's the cell? The cell is derived from the Latin "cellla", which means "small room" and first introduced a lab in examining the construction of the cork."
The cell is a basic unit of living things, and each body consists of one or more cells.
Cells are very essential and important in studying life, and many refer to them as “builders of life. ”
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending out nerve pulses in the body, ensuring the unconscious, continuous circulation of blood.
These nerve pulses are moving very fast in the body, so they help protect the body from any possible threat.

If we look at the creatures under a microscope, we'll see that they're composed of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, an English biologist, with a microscope, saw small squares in the parish.
They looked like a room, and he was the first person to observe dead cells.
Elements and compounds can be evolved from one cumulative condition to the other without changing.
The nitrogen gas properties are the same as the liquid nitrogen, which is more thick in liquid conditions, but the molecules are the same.
Water is another example, the water compound consists of two hydrogen atoms and a oxygen atom.
The molecular structure is the same, be gaseous, liquid or solid.
Although his physical condition may change, his chemical condition remains the same.
Time is around us, it affects everything we're doing, but it's hard to understand.
Time is also studied in the fields of religion, philosophy and science for thousands of years.
We live time as a series of events that go from the future through the scene to the past.
So time is also the process of comparing the duration of events (long-term).
You can also indicate the time pass by observing the recurrence of a cycle event. A cycle event is an event that is recurring.

Combined thinking patterns are problem-solving techniques that combine different ideas or areas to solve.
Its thinking is at the heart of speed, logic and accuracy, and the identification of facts, the reapplication of existing techniques and the collection of information.
The most important factor in this thinking is that there is only one right answer, and you can only think of two answers, right and wrong.
This type of thinking is linked to certain sciences or routine procedures.
People with such minds think logically, can identify samples, solve problems and work on scientific tests.

MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and covered by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University) in the 1930s.
At this resonance level, the magnetic field and radio waves are driven to release atoms with small radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a doctor and researcher discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance images as a medical diagnostic instrument.
Four years later, a patent was issued, the world’s first patent in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first "essential" MRI device called "unruly".

The postmodern approach to learning offers absolute exemption. It is not just a good way to learn.
In fact, there is not just one good thing to learn. Learning itself takes place in the field of experience between the student and the information provided.
Our current experience on learning-based television shows illustrates this point.
Many of us are involved in watching a TV show that provides a process or knowledge that we will never participate in, or that we will never use.
We will never produce a car, build a fountain in our courtyard, look at the ancient ruins in Peru, or rebuild the neighbour's house.

For more than two passengers a charge is to be paid, so this may be more expensive than necessary.
Antarctic is located around the southern corner, and this is the coldest point on Earth.
Tourist visits require costly physical strength, only between November and February, and are largely limited to the semi-insel and the Ross Sea.
Some thousands of workers live here in four dozen bases this summer, mostly in these areas, and some stay in the winter.
Antarctic is a 2 to 3 km thick ice armor covered with a smooth surface.
At times, special air tours are going to the land to climb or reach the corner where a large base is located.
South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a 1600 km long route from McMurdo Station to the Ross Sea.
This can only be carried on with special tractors that are loaded with fuel and supplies.
They're not moving well, so the route is a long way out of the Transsantartis Mountains before it reaches the top.
In winter, the most common causes of accidents are slipping roads, walks, and in particular stairs.
The minimum is that you need the right footwear. The summer shoes are usually very slippery on the ice and on the snow, but even some winter boots are not suitable.
The sample must be sufficiently deep, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more, and the material must be soft enough in cold weather.
Some of the tails also have straps, and there are also straps for sliding conditions that are suitable for most shoes and boots, corners or corners and feet.
The corners should be low and wide. Often spread sand, stone or salt (calcium chloride) on the roads or on the ground roads to improve the impact.
The lavina is not anomaly; the steep drops can only hold certain quantities of snow, and the excess quantity is spilled from them as a lavina.
The problem is that snow is clumsy, so he needs some intervention to start, while the start snow can launch the rest.
Sometimes the original trigger event is the snow warming day, other times the snow falls more, and other natural and often human events happen again.
The tornado is a rotating vertical, very low-pressure air column that sneaks the surrounding air inwards and upwards.
Strong winds (approximately at a speed of 100-200 miles per hour) are due and are able to lift hard objects into the air and take them along the tornado road.
They start as decaying tornados from storm clouds that are transformed into “tornados ” when they reach the earth.
An excellent method for playing political censure and commercial IP geofiltering is the personal VPN (virtual private network).
In many respects, web proxys are overrun: even all web traffic is redirected outside the http.
They usually offer more bandwidth and a better quality service. They are classified, so it is harder to spy on them.
"The media companies are routinely lying about this, claiming "to prevent piracy."
In fact, regional codes have no effect on illegal copying; a exact copy of a disc can be played perfectly on all devices where the original would run.
The real objective is to give these companies more control over their markets; this is all about the rotation of money.
Since calls are via the Internet, it is not necessary to use a telephone company within a place of residence or destination.
There is no need for a local phone number, you can get a satellite internet connection in Chicken, Alaska, and you can choose a number that shows that you are in sunny Arizona.
You often need to buy a global number separately, allowing your PSTN phones to call you. For the callers, the difference is where the phone number comes from.
Real-time translator applications - applications that can automatically translate full texts from one language to the other.
Some applications of the category can also be translated into foreign language texts of tables or other real objects if the smartphone is translated towards the subject.
The translator engines have improved dramaticly, and they often give more or less the right translations (and rarely they write a hit), but they still have to be careful because they still have the ability to misunderstand things.
One of the most reliable applications in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading the desired language data.
The simplest and most comfortable navigation mode is when we stay outside of our country with the GPS navigation application of the smartphone.
You can save the cost of buying a new map for GPS or a new GPS device or renting one from a car rental company.
If there is no data connection to your phone or weak signal strength, their performance may be limited or not available.
All corner stores are filled with a number of prepaid phone cards that can be used with pay or normal phones.
Although most cards are suitable for making calls anywhere, some are specially characterised by providing favourable call rates for specific national groups.
Access to these services is often made through a free phone number that can be called free of charge from most phones.
The rules for normal photography also apply to video recordings, and they may even be more valid there.
If there's no photo, don't even think about making a video footage of it.
If a drone is used, check in advance where you are allowed to record and what permits or additional licences you need.
It's never a good idea to run a drone at the airport or above the crowd, even if it's not illegal in the area.
Airways are now only rarely reserved directly to airlines without seeking and comparing prices for the first time.
At times, the same flight will have to be paid at large prices in different periods, so it will be paid if we compare the search results and look at the website of the airline before booking.
Although there may be no need for a short-term visit to certain countries for tourist or business purposes, travelling as a international student will normally require a longer stay than an average tourist.

Unless a diplomat, work beyond the sea usually means that income tax must be paid in the country where it is located.
Income tax has been constructed differently in each country, tax rates and bands can be very different from country to country.
In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is taxed at both federal and local levels, so tax rates and categories can vary per region.
Immigration checks are generally missing or only one formality at the time of arrival, customs control can be very irritating.
Make sure you know what you can bring in and what you don't, and report everything beyond the legal limits.
The simplest way to start the travel writing business is to improve skills on a well-funded travel blog website.
After you come into the formation and editing on the Internet, you can create your own website.
Volunteering during the journey is a great way of helping, but it is not all about broadcasting.
Staying in a foreign country and volunteering is a great way to get to know other cultures, meet new people, know themselves, learn how to identify perspectives and acquire new skills.
A way of extending the budget may be to allow longer stays somewhere, as many volunteers offer accommodation and food, and some offer even little salary.
The Vikings reached the Black Sea and the Kaspian Sea, a part of which can be sailed until today. Make sure there is no need for special permits, which may be complicated.
The Baltic Sea Canal is mainly connected by rivers and lakes to the Baltic Sea, passing through the Onyega lake, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg.
The Lake Onega joins the Volga, so it is still possible to enter Russia through the Kaszpi Sea.
You can be sure that as soon as you get to the ports, everything will become very clear.
In principle, it will give warnings offering its help in reaching the docks, the approach of people who clean their yachts, contacts with the sailors in the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as you can after a while, everyone will know you and give you tips about which ship is looking for someone.
You must carefully choose the membership of the tribal passenger within a airline.
Although it seems reasonable to join the airline with which we fly most, we must bear in mind that the benefits offered are often different and that reward points for frequent flights would be given more generously by the other airline in the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly extended their services in Africa and, against European airlines, they offer flights to many other African cities at competitive prices.
From 2014 onwards, the Turkish airline is flying to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have more time to travel, compare your offer for a full travel price on the African road with the cost of a trip around the world.
Do not forget to add additional costs of visas, airport charges, land transport, etc. for all places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world in the southern halfway, the choice of flights and destinations is limited due to the absence of overseas flights.
None of the air associations offer all the crossing over the three oceans on the southern shore (no one can be reached at SkyTeam).
However, Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern part of the Pacific which extends from Santiago de Chili to Tahiti and which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This flight is not the only option if we want to jump through the South Pacific and the western coast of South America (see below).
In 1994, the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Armenia launched a war against the Aserbaidschans in Azerbaijan.
A new Republic has been created with support for Armenia, yet none of the already formed nations formally recognise themselves in Armenia as well.
Diplomatic debates on the region continue to weaken relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The famous 17th - century district of the Canal (Grachtengordel in Dutch) surrounding the city of Amsterdam Binnenstad.
Due to its unique cultural and historical value, the whole quarter was declared to be part of the UNESCO World Heritage, and its property value is one of the highest in the country.
The Cinque Terre, which in fact means "five land" includes five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso in the Italian Liguria region.
They are also included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
During the centuries, careful people built terraces on the uneven, steep landscape, up to the rocks looking up to the sea.
Traffics, train roads and boats connect villages, and the car is impossible to get here.
French talks in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from France, although they are quite similar to each other to being understood.
In particular, in the French official language Belgium and Switzerland, the numbering system has some specificities, which are different from the French speaker in France, and the pronunciation of certain words is slightly different.
Nevertheless, all French-speaking Belgian and Swiss citizens learn traditional French in school, so they will understand even if they use the traditional French numbering system.
"In many parts of the world, it's a friendly gesture with the meaning of "sia"."
However, in Malaysia, at least among malays living in rural areas, it means “Come here”, similar to the fingers of reference to the body; a gesture that is used in some Western countries and should be used for this purpose only.
Similarly, a British traveling to Spain can misunderstand a farewell with a palm that is not on its way to Spain as an inviting gesture to return.
Helping languages are artificial or constructed languages designed to facilitate communication between people for whom communication would otherwise be difficult.
They are separated from common languages, which are natural or organic languages that become dominant among the speakers of other languages for one or another reason.
In the heat of the living day, travellers can experience southern ribbons that create the illusion of water (or other things).
These may be a threat if the traveller continues on the way to the south, wasting valuable energy and water.
Even the hottest deserts can get cold at night. Hypothermia is a real risk in the absence of warm clothes.
Especially in the summer, you need to take care of the mosquitos if you decide to travel in the rain forest.
If we lead through subtropical rain forests and keep the car's doors open for only a few seconds, that's enough for mosquitoes to get into our vehicle.
Avian influenza may infect birds and mammals.
Less than a thousand cases have been reported in people, but some of them ended with deaths.
Most of the cases concern poultry people, but they also pose a risk to ornithologists.
Norway is characterised by steep fjords and valleys that suddenly allow space to the high, more or less even surfaces.
"These surfaces are often called "vide" which means a wide, open, treeless, infinite area."
In Rogaland and Agder, this is usually called ‘hey’, an area with an avalanche, an unhealthy larvae.
The glaciers are not stable, they slip down on the hill, which leads to ruptures and fractures that can be covered by bewolves.
The walls and roofs of the ice caves can collapse, and the gaps can be closed.
From the edge of the glaciers, huge blocks are breaking and falling down and jumping or rolling.
The tourist season of mountain stations is usually peaked during the summer of India.
In the winter, however, they use other beautys and magic: many mountain stations have plenty of snow and they offer opportunities for skiing, snowboarding and similar activities.
Only a few airlines continue to offer fees for mourning, which will slightly reduce the cost of travel to the final funeral.
