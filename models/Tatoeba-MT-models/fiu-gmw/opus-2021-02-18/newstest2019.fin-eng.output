Eemeli Kouki led to Hurricane's home victory in the opening - Savo Volley's second victory.
The Hurricane-Loima, who had been with the medals of the men's balloon, started the season 2018-19 at home when the Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
From Romania to Finland, the public player Eemeli Kouki was 22 points most effective in Hurricane.
There were some inspirations to the foreign countries, but they did not come true, and then a call came from Lomada.
We got it done pretty fast, Kouki said.
Like Koukk, Tomi Rumpune played Lomussaki in 18 points.
The most effective part of the guests was Samuli Kaissalo 17 points playing with a match-specific agreement.
The win of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience on the opposite side, and it brought extra extra estra into the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but the extension of the medal pipe is, of course, the goal, Kouki said.
Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Määttänen was 18 points at Savo Volley's most effective when the team fell by the Neighbouring Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was sparkling, especially at the end of the attack, but fortunately, we had a crushed victory.
At least I didn't have any knowledge of any different downloads when I played against my former team, Mérettane said.
In the next balloon in the 3 series during the 2000-01 period, Antti Siltala made 12 points.
Chief Coach Jukka Tuvinen was pleased with a number of things.
The hall was a little, or mood on the roof all the time.
Well, I've got a good cop left on home opening.
Miro was the king, also played a good game, Sovínen said.
The last season of Siltala in the league was 2006-07, then he won silver in Pielaves at Sammo, even when he was the principal coach.
Thiago Maciel was at the most effective 14 points in Ducks.
Mikkonen's Aka-Volley Star again
During the 2012-13 league score exchange won Joni Mikkonen has also started this season strongly.
The hacker made 25 points when Aka-Volley took the opening profit of the season after the Cokkolan Tigers 3-2.
The season has started very well on its own.
Today, of course, we were close to losing, because we were the fourth one losing 17-21.
There was some victory, and the fifth batch came at the same time as Mikkonen said.
A few years ago, the Tigers were still in the finals of the most effective had 28 points made the hacker Edvarts Buvids.
Earthman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported 17 points.
We didn't get much shot at a guy's hacker, Mikkonen congratulated.
Finland compares human capital to world 1
Finland is at the top of the world in comparison with human capital, reports the Scientific Journal Lancet.
The study compared developments in human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 lands were compared.
In both years Finland was the first of the statistics.
In 2016, the first five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was after Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands placed one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, the poorest compared Niger and South Sudan.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population are considered.
The World Bank has aligned human capital with economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois was in charge of Atletico, and the local game ended without goal
Real Madrid's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched to glorious warriors, and the local game of the Madridian team ended in the goalless gaming late on Saturday in the Spanish football League.
Atletico from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest goal, but the Belgian guard Courtois was able to fight.
Courtois played in Atletico three through the loan was a player of Chelsea.
In the beginning of the week, the International Football Association, Fifa, selected him as a goal watch for the year.
In Real, Gareth Bale got the best destination, but his shot went past at the end of the opening half of the goal.
After the break, Bale left a change because of the thigh injury.
According to ESPN, the disappointed Realists cried the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus.
In the United States, we're now under attack against abortion law, a powerful document tells us why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to find out if one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected by President Donald Trump as candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republicans Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive voice would bring an end to the decision called Roe against Wade, which took place in 1973 on abortion in the United States.
The documentary film of Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg, Reversing Roe, United States, and abortion rights, tells us how the situation has come over the years.
As incredibly as it seems, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done public work against safe abortion and received support from the majority of our country's folk representatives.
At the beginning of the powerful document, gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only doctor who makes abortions in the state of Missouri.
The clinic's armed guard says he's defending the United States' freedom of religion.
News videos remind you of the killing terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Churchman Association guided women’s reliable abortion doctors.
The reasoning of the interviewed pastor is good, but in fact, they are not even needed, a photo of the dead woman who has made an abortion itself is enough.
The death rate was about 5000 years in the United States.
In particular, the Republican Party defended the legalisation of abortions.
Already in 1967, in California, the abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, Reagan, in his presidential campaign of 1980, began reversingly mixing religion with political voters as a hail.
His abortion stock was also wheeled by his successor, George Bush's parents.
And the same did Donald Trump.
The deepest document of the case is searching for the root cause of abortion policy.
When freedom of taxation was denied from religious organisations who supported race separation, they became politically active.
They've chosen an abortion as a puppy horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots into politics.
This is written in the United States in a situation where the president, who has captured the voices of religious right with his abortion, has chosen Kavanaugh as a candidate for the highest court, whom several women are now accusing of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh can be given the power based on the status of Va'an language to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army fired seven Palestinians, among the two children at the border with great demonstrations
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel has fired protesters in the border zone.
On Friday, the Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza Border Zone, reports by the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children: 12- and 14-year-old boys.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
89 of these wounded from bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike on the border zone when the protesters cast Israel's troops with stones and explosives.
The army says that he has started using force so that the protestors don't break down the border fence or try to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the demonstrations of Gaza since March when the Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Commissioner, 12 000 have been injured.
The speakers demanded access to the Palestinian families from which the Palestinians had to leave when the nation of Israel was set up in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one of the Israeli soldiers.
Explosions from the Palestinian side with lions and helium balls have set fire to forest areas and farming countries in Israel.
The Teemu Santa got a penitentiary he couldn't shoot himself.
Chey Dunkley, Wigan's top guy, seemed to have knocked him down with a tack in the penitentiary area.
Gavin Ward, Specialist, allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the twist was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was left to bother the separator Ward, who sentenced Norwich to the penal trap at the 85th minute when Santa was stabbed.
Ward looked like a punishment spike, and Mario Vrancic burst a 1-0 win.
Santa has made Norwich five goals in the Master Series.
The last one was born last Saturday against QPR in a stylish way with the breast muscle.
The work tasted like Santa again.
After he lost the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created goals and defended without being tired.
For Norwich, the fifth match was in two weeks.
The team's going on in the league.
There's a five-winning tube back there.
Pedophiles' help was completed immediately on reservations - about 40 000 in Finland experience interest in children
According to estimates, two per cent of men and a small part of women experience at least some sexual interest in prospective ages.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 people.
It has been difficult for those who have sexual interest in children or young people to get help so far.
The SerieE joint project of the Criminal Service Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to meet pedofiels as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was reported in the spring, the Sexpo offering advice and therapy began with an e-mail ending and the dating periods were made very quickly, Yle says.
However, they are promised to be released in the autumn.
Sexual preference toward children causes many to be ashamed.
The majority of those who notice pedophic feelings themselves have not done their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that harass and discourage them.
They also complicate normal life, says to Yle, the sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who is a special expert in the project.
I think that work is valuable if one child saves sexual violence, Thesleff says.
The chorean leaders or the Congolese Gynecologist?
As a winner of the American President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the greatest favorite winners on the basis of the betting rounds.
The background is the role of Trump in obtaining North Korea at least at the level of speech to commit to nuclear isolation.
On the basis of the multiplications, the most popular candidates for peace with Nobel are the President of South Korea, Moon Jae, and Kim Jong, head of North Korea, who have already met this year three times and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the chores is significant, as the gap was still shiny last year.
Yet, the rewarding of Kim, leading by the iron smuggling and landing with nuclear weapons for years, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The recipients of the Nobel Prizes will be published from Monday, and on Friday, the most observable is the peace prize.
If the prize is not awarded to those who participated in the diplomacy of the Korean peninsula, there is one of the leading candidates in the Congo, Denis Mukwege.
A renowned gynaecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become world leader.
Mukwege has paid attention to sexual violence, which is a terrible by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been considered to be the UN Refugee Organisation who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has told us that this year there are 331 candidates for the award.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if he had Nobel.
In May, a journalist asked him in the White House if he felt he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued referring to the North Korea negotiations.
However, there are some things that make Trump’s Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee has often given recognition to persons and organisations representing liberal democracy and the multifaceted world order - that is exactly the international cooperation which Trump has seen as its opponent.
In the 21st century, three US politicians, all who have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So the rewarding of the trump would require the Nobel Committee for a complete ideological translation.
Fire announcement in the tunnel: Car drivers behaved like tails and driving in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos in Lohja, which occurred on the one side, occurred on 8 September.
Traffic in the tunnel area was interrupted as a result of the announcement, both in the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it found out that it was a system error, the fire plant was trying to make traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the road transport centre said that it could not be opened because there are automobiles on the road to the shock, and they drive how it hurts, the voyage-friendly fireman Pasi Cruise told the latest STT at that time.
At that time, the motorway was driven even in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first begins to act against the traffic rules, some others are often followed, Tapio Heiskanen, contact manager of Transport Security, is amazed.
According to the traffic rules, the motorways and tunnels must not stop as a compelling reason.
Traffic security reminds us that in exceptional circumstances it cannot be taken to jeopardise traffic by insecure solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always be allowed to run as easily as possible.
In particular, driving in opposite directions on the highway is prohibited, as well as making a U-Translation and cancellation.
The same prohibitions apply also in tunnels, where the headlamps must always be switched on.
Stopping without compulsive reasons is also prohibited, as it is, of course, also parking.
There have even been cases since then where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and the time for the action in question, Heiskanen says in the road safety newsletter.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebrations, even though the ship was caught on the lake's bottom.
The Ilves fans carried by the Inland Ship M/S Tampere would have wanted to stay on the ship to continue their victory celebration even though the ship had been caught on the bottom of the lake, says Juyo Syrj, who was the chief of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, who was traveling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drove out of his route late on Saturday night and caught his bow on the bottom of the Old Javed in Aka.
19 passengers on board the ship and five crew members were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one got hurt in the pals.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations on the ship until morning, but of course it was more sensible to send them to the port and by bus, Syrja said to the STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna, following the Ilves and the HPK match that ended with Ilves' 4-3.
According to Syrje, on Saturday, his friend was caused by the surface of the water on Old Javed, about a half a metre below normal.
According to Syria, it also made it difficult to navigate because the nearest road mark was covered by log residues, so its reflectors did not normally appear in the dark hill.
No more mention of impact
The guy took place on the west side of the cape Jumusensalm shortly after the ship’s route had exceeded the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
More dramatically, according to Syria, the ship’s speed was very low at the time of the event and the impact on the ground was not caused by a remarkable collision.
According to the surge, it has not caused any leaks or weightings on the ship, and the cruises of the ship will continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the ducker went to check the ship's condition before the ship was swept off the matalic.
For the sake of certainty, we are still going to the shipyard to check that there was no damage, Syrja says.
The surjä believes that the next cruise in M/S Tampere, which is busted next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
The ship's cruise period continues, he says, until the date of independence.
No use for ambulances
The rescue facility received an alarm on Saturday night, just after half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half.
Ambulances were called to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for the ambulances.
My friend Matti Willman told me late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult because of darkness and a pretty heavy wind.
The Sanctuary of Pirkanmaa reported at about half three in the anti-Sunday night that all those on board had been evacuated and that passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser built in 1957 has been re-established in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The suspicion of intimidation and drunkenness of the judge of Trump may not have a peak post.
Brett Kavanaugh, a judge at the Supreme Court of the United States, may well fail the position he seeks, assessing the programme director Mika Aaltola from the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour during their studies.
According to Aaltola, the doubts have brought so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up acting as another person.
At times, in the United States, the president’s candidate for judges of the Supreme Court has caused a great deal of conflicts.
In that case, the candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the President has been able to keep his face.
The nomination would rain on the Democratic lair.
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above policy, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltola, the decision is likely to rain at the Democratic Laria in the forthcoming interim elections of the Congress.
It would increase the vote among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the highest court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
There is no chance to be appointed for every presidential term, for in the United States the judges of the Supreme Court will be appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired on their own request at about 70 to 80 years of age.
The Republicans, too, hesitated to be named
The judges of the U.S. Supreme Court are normally subject to a background review, says Aaltola.
Although Trump has only assigned a week's deadline to the FBI's additional report, he can still say Aaltola would bring something important to us.
It might bring you.
Rarely there's smoke without fire, says Aalola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's rightfulness or inappropriateness in the office will still be discussed in a keen manner before the senate decides.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate with 51-49 votes, but at least two female republikeinists are expecting to be suspicious about the appointment of Kavanaugh.
It would be most embarrassing to have a vote and the Republicans lose.
She identified Salisbury's suspect as an agent for military intelligence.
The Russian woman has told the broadcaster BBC that she would identify Salisbury's poisoning as an agent for the Russian military intelligence service of the suspected Russian man.
According to the photos, the woman said that it was a military intelligence with Anatoly Tshepi, who worked in GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported earlier that they revealed another of the suspected men of Tsjepiga.
They already said that they found evidence that the identity of men today is undercover.
A group of BBC traveled to the village near the border between Russia and China, where Tsjepiga grew up.
A woman in the village identified the pictures published by a young Tsjepigan Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from the pictures of the British police, where the man who is now known as Ruslan Boshirona was present.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning the former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter on Novitshok Hermyrky in March.
The Scripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been rewarded, among other things, by the glory mark of the Russian hero in 2014.
Russia still disputes the GRU link of the suspect.
The male suspected of poisoning reported earlier in September that they were tourists in Salisbury in the Russian TV interview.
Elderly thrown in the War reform
Now there has been a living example of what the Government of Sipilya is saying in practice by the limitation of the change of the war reform.
My birth Vaala war services are produced by Oulunkaare Municipality, whose former regional director of Attendo was elected in 2016 as head of health services.
The Municipality’s leaders warn the delegation of the change limiter.
If the war expenditure is now rising, municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The city’s central decision-makers were frightened, and most of them are prepared for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would stop the institution care of the bed department of the health centre and the small memory disease unit.
Home hospital treatment would be increased, which means that older people living in peripheral villages will be ripped from their roots next to the health centre for "home" treatment.
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay him the customers.
The left of the whale did not swallow bad preparations, but organised a public public meeting with many relatives, neighbours, and also authorised by other parties.
I presented the sote-north preparation on the diaries, how old people are already being treated at home in the Municipality of Vaala, most at home in the whole North Ostrobothnia.
Carina Westinn was also a member of the neighbourhood.
The local magazine made a big story about the opportunity, and it again lifted Oulunkaare's manufacturers on their back legs.
Sote manufacturers do not write in any paper that Attendo has built a new nursery in Walala, who is waiting for the residents to be empty.
There are no other service providers.
Preparators only talk about service bills, but do not tell us what level of care they receive or what type of staff Attendo will take care of the elderly until the admission.
Without a nurse?
The locations of the health centre are terminated by name because there is no medical fitness at night.
Attendo will also apply to doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the Valala shows how central officials run the authorised officers with deficiencies, and the authorised ones are stabbed against the wall with a change limiter.
This is how the Central Party clears the residents of Vaala, for who will remain unleashed to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was one of the constituents in the centre that the whole country was kept inhabited?
The Turkish President Erdogan opened a big mosquitoe in Cologne
In the city of Köln, Germany, thousands of people showed their minds when the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan opened the largest mosque in Europe.
A number of hundreds of people had been gathered on the Rhine from the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the signs of the protesters, and fascism was condemned.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, several demonstrations have been held, and security measures have been rigorous.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to protest on the human rights situation in Turkey in advance.
There had also been a gathering of supporters from Erdogan near the big mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the mosque environment for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan commended Germany’s visit and estimated that it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel swore that they would rebuild relations with countries which had become significantly worse since the 2016 Turkish coup.
However, the Merkel stressed that there are deep differences between countries, inter alia, on human rights issues.
Review surrounding a visit
Henriette Reker, Mayor of Köln and Prime Minister Armin Laschet of the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen, both cancelled their participation in the openings when the review of the visit to Erdogan accelerated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, reported that he came to an anti-Erdogan demonstration from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the final phase of the German journey to Erdogan in Nordrhein-Westfalen, a significant part of the population is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three charges for the murder of a reporter
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecution told me on Friday that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and this fiancée and other crimes.
Previously this week, the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found in February with his fiancée in Bratislava.
He had examined the connections between politicians and the Italian maffia.
The police have suspected murders related to Kuciak's findings.
The case and the Kuciak article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of the Herd on Sunday in dispersed areas
Due to the error of printing, the Shepherd on Sunday also has to be posted anonymously.
This may be seen in the distribution of the magazine in dispersed areas where the distribution to co-boxes is forced to perform external memory.
The same situation was with the Saturday magazine, and the problem may still continue on Monday.
The poster puts extra paper bouquets in the county.
The leaves of other Finnish subscribers will be posted separately only on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is considerably delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg interviews today in its forthcoming debate programme, among other things, Vesa Heilaa.
Vesa is in the studio telling us about her coming space trip, which she booked from Virgin Galactica in 2010.
The price amounted to EUR 151 000, which had to be paid as a bank loan.
If the original plans were correct, Vesa would have gone to space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has delayed a year.
It seems now that after the unlucky, in 2014 and after the trial of the death victim, things are still in line.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or no later than next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means that his journey is scheduled about a year from the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours, and the weightless state is 5 minutes at 100 km altitude, the Finnish astronaut tells us about his future homepage.
At the same address, he also refocuss the search for space.
When I was a kid, I read a cartoon magazine called Space Travel, and I saw the Star Trek series on TV.
Star wars have been seen, and that's what the idea left behind...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh host.
Manchester City continued his lossless journey in Valoliga, when it fell on Saturday in his homefield in Brighton's country of 2-0.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero are the guarantors of the sixth victory of the management team of the season.
Sterling was able to direct the fourth of the season from the nearest distance to an empty goal when Leroy Sanne found him in the back of the Brighton goal in 30 minutes.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he saw the Brighton defense with Sterling in pieces at the 65th minute.
The Argentine was able to locate the 2-0 drops on the line of punishment in an easy way.
With six wins and one equation, the city that started the season leads Valoliga with 19 points.
However, Liverpool, less played in one match, is stalking only one point away.
Liverpool meets on Saturday night in his seventh round in the match of three series to Chelsea.
The youth associations selected new decision-makers in Joensuu
The Finnish Youth Associations selected new decision-makers for the next three-year period of 2019-2021 at their meeting at the end of Sunday.
The president was elected from Anu Sivonen Upper Savo and Vice-President of Petra Mäkeläinen Hämee.
The council was elected from 40 members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Society will be informed on Sunday.
The meeting of the youth association was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural hobby activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Joensuu Youth Meeting gives three promises in its three-year action objectives: we keep the doors open to everyone, and we organise equal hobby activities regardless of the location and background of residence, and we support volunteering and people on their own growth paths, the Finnish Youth Society reports in its communications.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and amazed Ferraria: "Loves a very important driver"
In the interview with Blick, the Swiss newspaper asked the Brittician of Mersu whether he believes that the release of Kim Radikkus from Ferrari’s services would help Hamilton in the rest of the period.
Hamilton runs the Ferrari's second driver at MM points by Sebastian Vetti at 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told me that Raikkonen would not continue in the stable next season, while Räikkonen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't believe that the Raspberry would hit gloves in the dishes.
I don't think Kim will change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional... a fantastic driver.
He stays one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has been telling me that Raikkonen has been one of his first photos.
I don't know if Kim knows this, but when I was young, and I dreamed of a formula number one, I played F1 all day in PlayStation.
I was always Kim, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian competition.
At 14 o'clock from the stove, Mercedes Valteri Bottas is leaving the race.
The evening magazine is following the race for a moment.
The SM game of the A-Junges of Football became a complete farce: the opponent arrived only with the power of 7 players.
The upper level of footwear boys ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season is played.
Before the round at 13 a.m., the starting points for the championship were clear: FC Lahti for the Academy is enough for the first time to be a point in practice against Wasa IFK.
In order to turn the situation in the final round, Ilvesen, the second in the championship, must win the PK-35 and wish for the loss of the bhalers.
However, the Mastership of the Methites was virtually secured before the starter, as Vasa IFK had arrived in the Bay with only seven players.
If there were one fewer wings, the fight could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At a break, the Lags were leading 7-0.
One of the reasons for the Vasian gambling is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-Youth SM series, the P20 series, and the Men's Two C.
Wasa IFK has practically played in the Second against the fall of the whole season.
On Saturday, during the second round of decisions, the Vasa IFK will be forced to win the JBK in the guest game, and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own guest fight against KuFu in Taivala, Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on the roof in Eno, according to the rescue facility, was lucky.
A passenger car pulled out of the road and ended up on the roof in Eno on the story danger Sunday at 9:00 p.m.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were mildly injured, the rescue department is reporting.
Well, luck was involved. The newsletter says.
According to the rescue facility, the road was wet from the rain.
The police team went to the accident scene.
Supo expects new ways of investigating: Getting appliances and recruitments already done, not slowing out of foreign operations
According to Antti Pelttar, the head of the Supo has been prepared to make equipment purchases and train staff.
A permanent increase of around EUR 10 million would be expected when the intelligence laws entered into force.
The Helsinki Rakakadu (Supon) offices are already preparing a full head for the entry into force of the Intelligence Bulletins.
Antti Pelttar, head of Suppo, tells the West Media that equipment has already been purchased for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams's freaking out with a video that she sings in the topless, campaigning for breast cancer awareness.
The superstar of Tennis Serena Williams will meet again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video with his Instagram account, where he sings only hands in front of his breasts, reports the news agency AFP.
This paragraph is the 1991 hit of The Divinyls I Touch Myself.
With the video Williams supports the Australian breast cancer association.
"I voted in The Divinyls' Global Hit to remind women to carry out regular self-employed [front] checks," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in an uncomfortable area, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women, regardless of their skin colors, all over the world.
Early detection is all a and o it plays a lot of lives.
The second writer of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago when he was 53 years old.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which is made to honor Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer, but he gave us a hitch song to remind women of putting their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was published early on Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, Williams is praised for courage.
Williams left Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background of the United States open tennis tournament is three weeks ago.
Williams was fired at the head of the match and claimed, among other things, that men were accepted to use much harder than women’s players.
Chinese restaurant on mountain paths is not suitable for heightbearing
In addition to traditional Chinese delicies, the restaurant serves beautiful landscapes.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the Chinese province of Zhejiang.
It is literally located in the rock’s language.
From there, you can look at the forest that spreads below.
In the mountains of Longquan, the rich landscapes are caused by restaurant guests to burst their lives.
To get to the restaurant, you need to walk in the middle of the peach trees.
Restaurant opened for travellers on 19.9.2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant's toilet is.
Walking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, the place is told.
This is how it ends today.
It's all gonna end good in time.
Today, that is what happens to the domestic landscape drama of Korpela, which has been quite kept.
The third production period has passed as hot stones: last week, 722 000 Finns were viewed as a first presentation on television.
The peak figures themselves have no more practical meaning, because Heikki Looma and Jukka Mäkinen have no future.
During the final period, the relationship between Chalia and Mirku will be taken back onwards, and I think that her mother will be the first to think what to come.
Even the intersection between Anssi and Miisa is warm, in the light of recent events, just romantic, but then once again the Clam appears in the pattern.
The police are also suspicious about a man.
But no one knows how much fate is going to happen in advance.
Anita will be able to hear the amazing news.
The last will of the distance will be revealed, which brings a woman to tears.
After a week, the Sunday nights will continue with the latest episodes of Sorjone.

Should we go to work tomorrow at a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flussa season is hot.
A lot of scars stay home or not.
However, it is worth wondering whether others should be infected, as the disease may be contagious even if their own symptoms were small.
Sometimes the symptoms of flu are suddenly attacked, sometimes they appear in sparkles.
In the latter option, you may already be infected by others, even if your own symptoms seem small, says the Prevention release.
So you think you should stay home?
Prevention suggests that the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus has been infected for the day before the symptoms start and from then on, from five to five days a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or work.
You can go back to work when the cough is coughing and the fever is gone, says Professor Gregory Poland of Medicine.
It is also worth avoiding training.
It's too fast to return to the gym to slow the recovery down.
Also, remember to wash your hands, put them in your jersey and throw the garbage papers in the trash.
Poor move, though?
If you have to leave home sickly, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then you won't get your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Deserts are also limited to the mask.
Then how can I avoid the infections?
The best way to do is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15 - 30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the Miss's tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
The hockey player and the miss are often connected.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
In 2018, Miss Finnish crown has received Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.

In 2009, he was in the Finnish team at the 18-year-old MM race.
At the early dates of dating, the couple lived almost a year in a distance relationship, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get to the winner triangle and, as a result, have a career for me, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live separately, trust works well, and in the distance, it is the good thing that this initial pain stays over the whole time, Alina was struggling in May.

During a few generations, the continued growth of the economy has brought to ordinary people, especially in the northern half of the world, a living level, where only dreamed before.
However, the long-term crossing of the earth's viability and climate change will hamper this market economy's rock leg threateningly.

We made a lot of mistakes during the opening period, but fortunately, the Turks paint brought us stronger by the game.
Home team head coach John Allen said the game was under control, but the finishing of the goal brought pain again.
One defensive error took us a full score, Allen was embarrassing.
We were the best again!

The latest picture shows change: The strongest man in the world diminished tens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, the strongest man in the world, is going through an eye-inspiring transformation.
The British Eddie Hall hunted the world's strongest man's title for a long and determined time.
Hall could have eaten up to 10,000 kilos of food a day and weighed 200 pounds, according to the Mirror magazine.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Before the title was won, Hall confessed to damage to his body.
The human body has not been created to be this size, Hall said.
Britt was hunting the victory of the world's strongest man race, and the family man promised to end his career if the title was given.
Hall didn't want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise, and he was no longer seen in the most strong man races in the world of 2018.
On the contrary, Hall published a picture in Instagram, where he poses considerably in the condition of his active career.
Hall writes his current weight is 169.5 pounds.

M/S Tampere stopped the cattle on the Lake of St. Mer - "Stop trapping on the rocks"
The Inland Ship M/S Tampere was driving on the road late on Friday night at Akala on the Holy See.
The rescue facility received an alarm of a water accident on Friday night after half twelve.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has driven to the chapel, and he is firmly stuck on his bow with a rock, described by the Oxeral Fireman Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the rescue facility, personal damage was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated on the mainland from the ship.
Now they are transferred to Tampere with a bus ride, and Jari Nieminen STT told him after 1 o'clock in the night.
Ambulances were called to receive evacuated passengers at the Vialan port.
For some reason, a ship traveling from the town of Hämeen to Tampere had moved away from its route on the west side of the Cape Jumusensalm.
The police will find out what's going on.
Earlier this evening, Collega Matti Willman told me that the conditions on the lake are difficult because of darkness and a pretty heavy wind.
The rescue plant says the ship's destiny is unclear.
Apparently, the ship isn't leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divesters will start to check the situation on the ground.
M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is now an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant ship with a maximum permissible passenger capacity of 180 persons.
A meeting space for private use shall also be rented on board.
According to the ship’s website, the cruiser has been renovated in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The freezing air's getting out of here. Look at the weather forecast of the day.

Ex-managers demand Robert Helenus' unpaid rewards.
The fight against Erkan Teper, the fighter Robert Helenius tonight, is shadowed by money disputes.
In the evening-Sanomas today, the boxing manager Jaakko Helmen and subscribed owner Jussi Kokkila's call for a challenge in which Helenius and its late interest rates are recovered for a total of EUR 80 000 unpaid manager fees.
According to the application, Helmine and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to settle, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear mandate, and the work has been done very much, and Kokkila says to the evening-Sanom.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent to the evening press with a reply to what was happening in the boxer’s view.
Helenius objects to being liable to pay the required amount.
According to their respondents, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services financially in a difficult situation to Helen and promised that they would be able to organize her games and sponsor income.
It was traditionally agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay the rewards only percentages of its fights.
Repeatedly it was assured that Helenius did not have to pay anything but receive the income they arranged.
This is also a normal and unique practice in the management of professional sports athletes.
There has never been an agreement on wage work and that would have been in the absurd situation of Helenus, Sundman will find out in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to Helenius, from the outset he would have liked to agree on the distribution of income in writing, but Kokkila and Sundman only received the draft before the end of 2014.
He said that the proposal was weak on his own, and he cut off co-operation with Kokkila and Helmis.
Helenius did not fight once in dealing with Kokkila and Helmis.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helen had been given a "individual but massive" fall from the manager's work.
This year, the action has been brought up with the same allegations.
Helenius sees the post-treatment of Helmine and Kokkila as poor, the replies say.
Helenius faces today the IBF's heavy series of interviews at Erkan Teper Stuttgart, the seventh.
A hearty man and a good reporter
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio felt the deceased radio broadcaster and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
The long-range radio broadcaster and journalist Erkki Pälli died of unhealthy liver cancer when he was 83 years old.
The report of the contractor's death was published on Sunday in Sanome, Helsinki.
The report reports that Päll died on September 3rd.
Pärli reported serious illness on its Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at that time by Ile Vainio, who was saddled by the knowledge of the known fate.
He left on Facebook earlier as farewell, Ile Vainio says.
The paranoia thinks Erkki Päll is a multi-good talented expert who became a great reporter.
He recalls that Päll was a man who had fast hockeys and funny things.
I learned to know Erk as a little boy when I first went to Finnboard when I was 12 and started there as a warehousekeeper.
That's when Erk and I met him.
At that time, he was a journalist of the Finn record and in various tasks, Ile Vainio remembers.
As a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a standard editor at all parties.
He was always skilled and saw how much fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly to the skin of his interviewers.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
Many of them knew him as a renowned radio drinker of Yle, but he also wrote glorious newspapers.
Erkki interviewed me a lot too.
He was good to talk, and the Paranoia commends me.
During the decades, Pälli worked with the Fazer record company Hope Kärje in addition to the editorial work.
He was a music producer on the plates of Vesa-Matti Loir.
However, the greatest passion of the sun was a radio work in which he had a unique style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar with a number of listeners in Ylen’s ether.
The bank retired in 1998.
On Saturday, the Finnish Shipping Union announced that the financial year that ended in May was about EUR 450 000.
The Union describes its economic situation as a "full translation", although the economy is, of course, burdened by "significant debt in the balance".
Managing Director Mika Kulmala commends rapid response and rigorous economic discipline.
In the last fall, we will respond as quickly as possible, taking adjustment measures.
Operations with careful planning and economic management have been hit through our entire organization, Kulmala reports in the newsletter.
We have also succeeded very well in partner procurement, and the world's yield was maximised in the past competition period.
However, in the future, cost management must also be precise, while we must continue to look for new funding models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was a silence.
Ten bodies lie in the hospital's backyard, please, in the island of Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from the area in which the injured survivors have been assembled to assess the need for injury and treatment.
Patients are also treated outside for postmortems.
One of those who moved in the hospital area was a 52-year-old beggar, Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I talked to him, when he was going to school, Baharuddin told the news office to AFP.
In the yard area of the Army Hospital in Palu, Dwi Haris was lying in his back and arm.
He was at the beginning of the earthquake at the local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family had been invited back to the wedding party.
I was probably under the wall that fell under pressure.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was a silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe. Haris News Office told the AP, according to the British media.
Small stores robbed
Please, at the evacuation center, the mother of a 35-year-old baby, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm down her hot baby.
He described the moods in the city as cries.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, told Kusuma.
Many Please residents have slept outside or in temporary bamboo farms.
Even though the house is standing up, possible after-scensions could destroy it for good and bury the residents underneath.
According to the press office AP, more than half of the prisoners in prison were escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
The prisoners were known to be about 560, so there may be some 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners of the prison in Donggala have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the papers, the prisoners raged and set fire in prison after the guards had denied them to go looking for their relatives who had suffered the earthquake and the tsunami.
Please, the airport has been reopened mainly for aid flights.
Among the first ones, the military transporter C-130 landed in the field, which brought back supplies.
Commercial flights Please be allowed to the field only limitedly.
Pilots have to land on the field without air traffic control assistance because the air traffic tower was damaged in a severe earthquake.
The rain wipes over Finland at night
The whole country is spreading in the anti-Sun Sunday night from the west, a long rain area, says the Air Science Institute.
The rain is mostly watered, but it is expected to travel or snow in the Central and North Lapi.
The last night’s flasks are not recurring because under the cloudside the temperatures remain higher.
A more cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures quite efficiently controlled.
Right in the west, you can visit the cold side, said the meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain area goes eastwards in the morning.
In the south and west, there are poutas or half clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures are always moving up to Oulu altitude at 10 to 13 degrees.
The initial week looks similar for the temperatures in the south and central parts of the country, but the weather is becoming more insecure.
Wind and wave warnings are in force in the marine areas.
There are no special storms expected for the next few days, but otherwise, there is a typical autumn variation in weather.
I'm sure the fall starts kissing me in real serious, Ilkka said.
Miss Finland isn't on TV.
From the IL-TV, you will be able to follow the red mattress glamour and the radius of the Miss Finland competition.

We were hoping he could go to college before he went to the Mississippi.
The Russian Dimitri father and inchery Svetlana mother believed in the success of their daughter in Miss Finland.
Ms. Alina Voronkov, the parents of Ms. Alina Voronkov, Ms. Voronkov, and Svetlana Voronkova followed the first moments of her daughter's crown.
They came to the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful mood!
We believed Erik all the time, but half an hour before we got out, Svetlana was laughing.
Svetlana is an Indian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks a smooth Russian, although she has lived her entire childhood in Finland.
Svetlana tells me that when she was little, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than Miss's career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should be a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio drinker.
Only later, Alina was excited about beauty competitions.
The parents wanted Alina to go to college before she participated in the Miss Finland competition.
That's what happened, and finally, Alina wanted to make the stand's degree before the miss.
Last year, we already asked why he didn't participate, but he wanted to finish that stand.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He sports a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be present, it's visible.
Alina's boyfriend, Jonas Hurri, is working in Japan and couldn't get to Finland to encourage his love in the final.
Alina's parents believe that the youth relationship lasts for a year.
Yes, that's the point!
The parents hoped that the daughter would be able to visit soon.
Now there's been such a long break in visits for the missiles.
I miss it, even though they've put messages.

Further information is available at the beginning of next week.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and started to be a home mother in Finland - the idea of a comic: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
In a time, my husband left the story where he suggested it to be a person, says the Espolainen comic blogger, home mother, and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says that she was in Brussels as an economic and judicial translator for the EU until after the fourth child, the family became a return mover ten years ago.
I've been enjoying my home mother very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I remembered what it would do when the smallest child started to be big.
Then the 2014 picture came into a comic.
The Bishop tells me that he never dreamed of making a comic, even though he had read the Aku Ankka, Tint and Asterix from a small age.
The last time I had drawn as a child, but when these scripts of the Creative Creation began to be born, the situation changed.
At first I made a few dozen manuscripts in the table box.
My daughter Vivi Valkama (p. 2000) is a skilled designer, but I couldn't attract her until the summer of 2016, when I gave the Devi drawing plate.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen stripes, and then he had to start trying, laughing at Pippo, which tells him that the drawing board was a great stimulus for him.
The drawing board is a simple and convenient tool to try to get something early.
I didn't even try to draw on the paper, tell Piippo about his relationship, which he usually does at night.
I keep thinking about scripts, but I usually don't make it at once.
One of the three square stripes takes more than a few hours.
I might make the screen at a time and play with the colors.
Starting the drawing is always the hardest because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates the current series of newspapers, among other things, Scott Adams Dilbert.
As individuals of the creature, the mother of the carrot body who has a salad hair salad washed into the L-thema.
The other persons are Man, Piss and the Twins.
In a world of creatures, man is what he eats.
A series of ideas come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer a bottle of obsession, even if there's a thing in the Creation Bullet.
The bishop tells us that he reads his series with his husband and children.
I mean, it's such a great feeling when you look at the comic picture you're drawing and say this is what I've done today.
And there's plenty of challenges for my home mother!

Anthonius Gunawan Agong, 21-year-old, has become the hero of the earthquake in Indonesia.
Agung remained alone in the air traffic tower until he received a safe journey from the island that was shaken by the earthquake to carry hundreds of passengers.
The young man was in turn at the flight control of the Mutiara Al-Jufrie airport in the city when the earthquake hit on Friday.
As the others escaped from the air control tower, Agung refused to leave his place before he was able to get Batik Air's passenger plane from the runway to the air.
In this way, he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Juffrie airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The tower of the flight was swinging and shaking.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke, and he had serious internal injury.
Agung was thrown into a close hospital.
He was supposed to be transported by a helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before he arrived, the aviation administration told The Jakarta Post.
The impact continued to increase after the flight entered air, and its strength was measured at the end of 7,5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected the heroicity of Agung in the social media.
Rehn thought about the conclusion of Europe in the trade war: "I must look at the next twittet"
The trade war between the United States and China reflects the whole world economy.
Overall in Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated and the Bank of Finland also slightly reduced its own economic assessments.
President Olli Rehn said in Ylen's first reading that although the aggravating tension has no direct impact on European trade flows, it weakens confidence, which reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also concerns the exports of Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn believes that Europe is so far a great baker.
It has been able to build peace with the United States and contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be inclined to the legs of a trade war.
We have to look at the next twot and then evaluate.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington, but he said in Yle's interview.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of these is Italy's third largest national economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most debtable countries in the euro area and in the Western world as a whole.
Last night, the market reacted sharply to the deficiencies of the Italian Government on Thursday night.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4 per cent of the public product.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
5% of the country's loan rate is problematic credits and there are more than 10% of the unstructured loans.
Furthermore, its public finances are weak and it seems that the country is reexistent with its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting new crises yet, Rehn answered when asked him if Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another issue facing Europe is the distinction between Britain and the EU.
Rehn hoped it was in line.
The conflict would have much more negative effects.
Rehn started in July as President of the Bank of Finland.
Mario Draghi, Director-General of the European Central Bank (ECB) will withdraw from his duties within a year.
The conversation with his followers has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erki Liikasen's name have been fluent in speeches.
I'm sure it's okay if the Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that he would not comment further on this.
HS's super-favored Black Box shows will continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale.
The popular Black Box performances organised by the Sanomes of Helsinki will continue again in the week.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
October 23, The Black Box visits Tampere theater for the first time.
There are still some tickets to the national theater.
The Tampere show's finished.
Tickets are sold by Flag.fi.
The journalists and photographers on the stage during the evening report the facts they have prepared, which have not previously been published in any HS instrument.
There's something that no one's ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from the other side of the earth and a talking story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet the HS suppliers and photographers and to continue the debate.
The Sanomats of Helsinki have been organising live journalistism in the evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the view.
The black box was rewarded in the Bonnier gala as a year's journalistic act.
The rewarders thanked for a new way of making journalistism and the desire of journalists to come near their readers.
The spring 2019 Black box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance is also visited in Tampere and Turku.
The show that we saw back there has a different content than in this autumn.
The missing mushroom was found through a "precautionary experiment"
The Finnish police's drone skills are the top of the world: "We are asking for training"
According to the head of the University of Police, the police can use a drone not only for missing persons, but for example for crime scene investigations and inquiries.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police succeeded in finding a missing mushroom drone in Raahe only in a few minutes.
Director Kimmo Himberg of the University of Police University of Applied Sciences said, among other things, that "with unforeseen experiments and effective training, we are also at the top of the world".
Drone's a pretty new revolt, and it's a newer police mission.
There is no record of the fact that the Finnish police are the champion of the drone's use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been achieved, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported in international events.
There's a lot of interest in that, says Himberg.
It would be hard to push the visitors to watch the Finnish police drones.
They're asking us for training.
Enlargement
Himberg recalls that finding the missing in Finland's winter conditions is very important as soon as possible.
As has been said, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found using the drone only in a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they're meant to be trained more.
The drone is already being used a lot in police tasks, and its use is becoming more widespread and increasing in the future.
That's how I dare say, Himberg tells me.
In addition to looking for missing persons, the police, according to Himberg, are able to use drones for, for example, accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence.
For example, we already need to check some area a little further, where there may be fear of violence.
Drone can then be used for prior intelligence.
Karelia Rugby rose to the First Divide.
Karelia Rugby celebrated a two-division victory on Saturday in Kuopio.
The Joensuaris were still in the middle of the match with the 7-12 deaths to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found the plot and chopped the guests from the south 26-12.
At the same time, the championship of the 2-division knew the historical rise to Karelia Rugby in its 1-division.
In the past, society has played first, but then the Finnish rugby series had been divided into two levels, a SM series and a multi-division of 1-division.
The Society is going to take the serial place, but it knows a lot of work next winter.
The current less than 20 players' razor must be raised to 25.
The 1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer gaming trips, so also the provision of money must be in line with it.
Kotkaniemi begins the season in Montreal, confirms the principal coach
The main coach of Montreal Canadiens at the NHL, Claude Julie, confirmed the company on a Twitter account that the Finnish thief Jesper Kotkaniemi begins the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise on Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round with number three in summer reservations.
The attacker was involved in the training strength of Montreal in the end of the summer and has presented strong extractions in the September training games.
The Cotkaniemi managed to finish the goal immediately in the first exercise.
Chief Coach Julien commended the Finn to take major steps to the communist camp after arrival.
The NHL band series begins next week on Thursday night in the anti-Successance of Finland.
Montreal meets the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What's a good leader?
This week there has been a lot of talk about leadership in Finland.
In his interview with HS, the president of Nokia’s government, Risto Siilasmaa, told his library of Paranoid’s optimism, where he illustrates his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Olila.
Ollila argued that the accusations were heavily, but even in the previous Nokia reports, the inability of leaders to act as a team; fear and non-speakingness, which caused the collapse of mobile business.
The risk-taking capacity and flexibility of the company's rising phase disappeared.
In Helsinki a week there was also a business gigantic event in the Nordic Business Forum, which dragged the Finnish Business Cream to the Messus Center.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 Stars of business worlds rose on the stage.
That's enough for good leadership.
The legend of the Leaderships, Gary Hamel, said that a good leader must dare take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most mentally linked to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the Whole Foods trading chain known for a wide range of creations, said that the manager must be able to communicate to the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that may not be just a purpose of doing victory for owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote the Introverts of the Success Book, told me that the most successful leaders are researched humility.
They act peacefully, quietly and determined.
They're often introverted.
Professor Aswath Damodaran of the financial sector recalled that the characteristics of a good manager must be hit by one of the phases of the company's life cycle.
At the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
A mature company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These teachings were listened to 7,500 visitors in the Nordic Business Forum, mainly Finnish leaders.
They were at risk with a dime of information.
There's a lot to be asked of a good leader.
That is why management is so often wrong, including at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They talked to each other in the cults in a comradely manner.
However, they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humiliation was not easy for an outsider to judge.
Sara Chafak arrived in a lovely red carpet right out of Los Angeles to spend most of her year abroad.
The model Sara Chafak arrived at the Missifinal in a beautiful black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland's show-up dress also had a pizza lap.
A little pode jet law.
I came back from Los Angeles again.
I spend most of my time long there, Chafak tells me what he belongs.
Chafak says he's going to L.A.'s audition.
He's done some of the commercials.
In the United States, he describes his work as interesting, and he also describes it as the same as in Finland.
However, he says that work needs to be done more hard, because the model’s work is easy to find a replacement.
You have to kiss harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreography Sonya Lindfors 30 000 euros live art award in Kuopio
The artist Sonya Lindfors won a 30 000 euro cultural prize on Saturday in Kuopia.
Lindfors, awarded by Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, is working on choreography, community activism and teaching.

The Danish police found the big operation searched for Volvo, "We can't tell you what"
The Danish police's extensive search has produced results.
At the beginning of the mission, traffic was closed on the bridges of Juutinumuma and Ison-Belt.
All land and ferry transport from Sjállann Island was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
I.S. has reached the head of the Copernicus Media Center in Copenhagen.
We've found the car we've been looking for.
We can't tell you where the car was found, Henrik Storm tells the cops of Copenhagen about the news of the night-Sanom.
According to Storm, there's no direct link between the black Volvo and the police.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish Extra Bladet told the police about a Saturday press conference.
The investigator Jørgen Bergen Skov was in charge of a silent operation.
He didn't want to tell me what criminal code he's looking into.
However, Skov told me that it was a serious crime.
It was a threat to people's lives.
They've been looking for three people in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they're already caught.
According to the paper, the limitations on the shipment have been cancelled.
The Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, there is no need for the public to worry about, as certain people were threatened.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades of disagreement, now the people will vote in disputes on this matter.
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on a proposal for a new name.
According to the Agreement between the Governments of Macedonia and Greece, the Republic of North Macedonia would be named.
So far, Greece has prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of NATO and the EU in its veto law.
According to Greece, the name of Macedonia belongs to its northern county.
The issue of the referendum does not refer to a new name, but to the question of whether the voter supports the EU and NATO membership of Macedonia by accepting the agreement.
At least the school in the centre of Skopje, the capital city, started on the basis of the vote.
The retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted in school, wanted support for the agreement.
Referendum means a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
This means change especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contacts.
The Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the adoption of the Agreement.
The national-minded right opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for the boycott referendum.
In addition to the result, it is exciting to see whether the vote will rise by more than 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the votes would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
The Greek Parliament must still accept the agreement.
The votes are closed at 8:00 a.m. in Finland.
That's a handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocked down Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius encountered late Saturday night Erkan Teper in a heavy series of professional fights in Germany.
The 34 - year - old Finn took a measure of his 36 - year - old German opponent in Waldenbuch in Stuttgart’s cup.
Tonight's main game was the Intercontinental team of the heavy series of the IBF Association.
Its winners may be able to be able to fight on a harder task as they saw on Saturday, whose financial importance is significant.
Helenius solved the game in the eighth round, when he knocked Teper with his hard left hand.
Teper couldn't get off the floor anymore.
Nordic Nightmare hurt his opponent already in the third batch, when the German nose started bleeding.
Helenius and Teper met for the first time in the ring.
They had to fight in December 2015.
That's when Teper appealed to hurting and withdrawed from the fight.
Afterwards, it was found that Germany had been double-crossed in the doping test.
Helenius has taken his names out of his professional career 28 fights and suffered two losses.
Teper, who went to the game as a clear favourite, has won 19 professional games and lost three times.

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla’s automotive company, leaves its duties as chairman of the company’s board.
Musk has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk has set up a fine of $20 million for its transcripts, which would have ensured funding to withdraw Tesla from the market.
The US Securities Commission SEC has accused Musk of securities treason.
Musk will continue as the Managing Director of Tesla, but the company must also pay the fines of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is established in the court.
Canada fights against time to reach a match with the United States of Nafta
Time threatens to end in the middle of the negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set the back line on Sunday, and the negotiators of the countries have debated closely throughout the weekend.
The Canadian Prime Minister, Mr Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
On the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement for Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but the agreement with Canada has not yet been established.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Mr Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential elections in the beginning of December.
Trump has said that the participation of Canada in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed the Congress that the plans are to sign the agreement at the end of November - with or without Canada.
In view of these schedules, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday in order to allow the United States Congress to have sufficient time to assess it.

There was no fire on the target.
The police captured 11 people after the Honka-HJK game... crashing in the field and in the metro station.
The police captured 11 people after the Hunka-HJK game of the men played in Espoo on Saturday, and the Criminal Commissioner Teemu Värtinen confirmed the STT.
The reason for this was the protection of crime and disruption.
After the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
He used to tell me about his engagement in the evening-words.
The match ended with 0-0.
After the end of the storm, a large number of viewers flew into the field from the view for HJK’s supporters.
The situation led to strangulation and fist fights between team supporters.
Among other things, horse police were needed to stop the situation.
In addition to the field, there was a burst in the area of a nearby metro station where a part of the catches took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw from the pictures was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the wreckage in the field.
I'm pretty sure there's been no criminal announcement as a result of the events.
The table stone was discomforted by the butterfly's SE season in the World Cup, Laukkanen swims also to the final.
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tablestone have gone to the finals on the day of the World Cup 3/7 competitions in Holland.
The races are swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
The HSS Tablet Stone was discomforted by the Finnish record of 50 metres of butterfly in which he was the second in the initial period of 22.82.
Previously in September, the table stone was floating in Helsinki on the SE season 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Lukkanen, representing the Espoo Cetus, was butterflying in 24:68.
Swiming Club Vuukakänen was at the beginning of a 50-metre breast sleep in the sixth time of 30.48 and progressed to the final.
At the beginning of two hundred metres of mixed sleep, Laukkanen was 15th in the time 2.14.25.
Students act like a rare delicious: ancient tragedy - a slighted orestey affects its visuality
Antique tragedy is rarely delicious on Finnish scenes.
For example, the National Theatre has last seen an ancient tragedy, Sophokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre High School brought an antique tour of the National Theatre the only remaining playtrilogy, Aiskylus Orestei.
The Platform Opens! projects started in 2015 by actor students at the Theatre University work internationally with the professional director.
The pilot of this fourth project, like the first one, is Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
In April, Orestei received his international pre-night in Berlin.
Roiha's reconciliation in Oresthea summarises the report on the end of the blood collection of the destructed family of Atreus and the birth of the rule of law to 20 minutes, especially by increasing the choir proportions.
The work will succeed in being very faithful to the people of Kirsti Simone's great Finnish (2003).
The dramatic lights and theatrical sides highlight the exhibiting thoughts of fearless and bright imagination.
At its centre, there is a dynamic between the choir and the performers of nominated roles, and the choir.
It uses both double and triangles of nominated roles.
The performers do not leave the scene at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon returning from the war of Troy and his war hall Kassandra are shown on the scene, unlike in the ancient performance strategy.
Of course, the performance does not highlight that he is loyal to an ancient performance strategy.
Rather, a modern, loyal interpretation of the text is created before the eyes of the viewer, which is constantly conscious of its ritual roots.
Roija has succeeded in bringing out a close group of performers of the Master's degree, even a group of rhythms that appear as one organism.
Especially in the choir sections, those who tend to very expressive, sculpture-like group formations will be able to get to their rights on the bare, only by cleaning the white anterior, on the scene.
Impressive.
Orestheia's performance tour goes on to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
The Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen charger
The news begins to be seen in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement concluded with Hyinda and the Swiss Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published in the IAAA IAA Hannover, Hyundai delivers a thousand car batches of renewal models for the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing on the market a fuel cell truck Hyundai continues with Nexon and the ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models on the road as a manufacturer of hydrogen cars.
With this quality of the world's first project, we are going to take the fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the tanking network, Hyundai Motor's Vice-President In Cheol Lee said in the publicity of the contract.
The boobs were swept several times in Kajaan.
A little over thirty - year - old man abused three men at a restaurant in the centre of Kajaan and on Saturday morning at night.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, which led him to be removed from the place.
Outside, he pushed another man into the country, and when a third man entered the situation, he was also beaten by a abuser.
The police arrested the assassin.
At the police station, the man was still acting aggressively and kicking another cop into his foot.
He also threatened the police by assaulting and killing.
The man was taken to the prison to calm down.
The matter is investigated in three cases of assault and in violent opposition to a official.
Another case of assault occurred on Saturday morning in the morning in the middle of Kajaan.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
At first, about 20-year-old Cayanian guy hit the victim.
Shortly later, another man knocked him down, and the man who hit him earlier kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled the assassins away from the victim and the police called.
But the killers have already left before the police arrived.
The police asks the witnesses to contact the Kajaan police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail to the investigation.kainu@poliisi.fi.
Long-range radio broadcaster Erkki Pälli is dead.
Erkki Pärli, known as a long-term reporter, died of cancer when he was 83 years old.
Radio warrior Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of unhealthy liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook website in March 2018.
Yes, we're going now.
The doctor has said that, I live on a day at a time, he commented on his situation in the evening magazine a month ago.
The security of trade aunts and seals must be guaranteed
For the first time in 1984, I was paid for a newspaper story.
When there is a subject of surprise on these years rings, it is usually a big news.
When I wrote (Kariana, 27.9) about the security of retail workers, I was amazed and even a little angry at moment.
I also talked to the issue of the Department of Services (PAM) Work Environment Expert Erika Käääälä.
He says crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers of course claim otherwise.
The police are only aware of cases which are clearly serious, and many of the real cases of violence remain unannounced.
"It is certainly a duty for businesses to keep their statistics close on the basis of the law on safety at work, but these statistics remain for internal use and do not collect their data anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end with statistics.
There has always been a problem in violence situations that do not always cause physical injuries.
However, mental trauma may be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the violent situation and the threat of violence is difficult to draw, even when a certain level of aggressive threats must be counted as violence, even if there is no hand in hand.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even if it does not happen.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store's got guards.
As the opening hours were released, the volume of steam in the media was high in terms of its impact on the safety of the sellers.
"And then many employers arranged security services for at least nighttime hours and to prevent working alone," Slangä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is made.
This seems to have had an effective effect, but it produces a new negative trend.
As a result of security, there was an imagination that security would be unnecessary.
Now many places try to find solutions to remove expensive security services.
A slight abuse is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that the seller who has been abused does not want to file an investigation request for a criminal who usually lives in a trader.
However, according to the same paragraph of the law laid down in 2011, mild assault becomes subject to the prosecution if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time you're dealing with an Aunt or an uncle being abused, the police should be investigated and the prosecutor is charged.
When the court puts a few assassins into prison and the judgment of a hard head of the penalty, the customs would be cleaned up.
A society where food stores should be open almost 24 hours in small places must ensure the security of the workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed for the miss before the live broadcast began, "Sara, Iro is then married"
This year, Miss's crown isn't traditionally seen on TV, but the broadcast shows Viafree website.
Former host of Miss Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet are the actor of Janni Hussi.
Before direct broadcasting, three of the programmer told the guests and media representatives who arrived there about the cost of the broadcast.
At first Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a fresh applause.
Now all the women scream!
Now look at this male drinker, Sohlberg glowed his colleagues in the hurrats of the audience.
In the years before, Miss Finland is following the frontier races.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next door, and Sohlberg threw a little joke in one direction.
Sara, Irro is married.
Sohlberg sniffed around the Saras.
The more I think Sohlberg referred with his throw to the just divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
Soap spoke for the first time in the afternoon-Sanom's weekend magazine about his divorce.
The lady-in-law said that she did not want to open the causes of the difference in the publicity, because that is a matter between her and Roope Salmis.
He said he wasn't in a hurry to have a new relationship, but he's going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff, and in particular, I'm starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula’s marriage status appeared at a later stage, when Sohlberg accidentally misled to call Janni Hussia and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The three of the runner laughed at the mess.
Iro was married, or how did it go?
Janni Huss made a mistake.
The North Man tortured his coworker by cutting, burning, and feeding a strong sauce
The northern court has condemned a 34-year-old man who lived in Kokkola for a number of crimes committed to his open side for three years in prison.
As a criminal instrument, the belt, cable and nipple bands were among other things.
The court condemned the objects concerned as lost to the State.
Rankin's accusation was a suspect of serious rape.
However, the supreme charge was rejected.
Four assaults, serious assaults, compulsion, illegal threats, liberty abuse, serious liberty violation, and two damages.
The crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May last year.
After the last acts, the man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday the past week, the North Pole Court sentenced and ordered its 34 - year - olds to remain in Vaasa.
No evidence of rape
34-year-olds were also charged with two brutal liberty contraventions and the brutal rape that took place on 22 May.
However, these accusations rejected the truth as not to be seen.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, a public statement of the judgment was issued by the clergyman.
According to the crooked emperor, the accused had targeted violence, threats, and forcedness in situations where this had been committed.
The defendant cut his victim with a knife, smoked with a cigarette, fed a strong sauce, poured water and coffee on it.
In his judgment, the court ordered the State to lose the criminal instruments: the belt and cable, the nipples, the bathing jacket belt, the knife and the wrist.
Four Witnesses
According to the law of the Municipality, the parties continued their life together.
The sentence shows that a large part of the most serious crimes occurred at the end of the period of crime.
Four Witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The victim's 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, pain, suffering, and temporary harm of EUR 5800.
I don't think he has the money in question, because the convict has already had debts in his old legacy.
Prison isn't the first of a man.
The evening magazine won't say the name of the convict to protect the victim's privacy.
A fresh court of law is not lawful when writing this.
Europe, leading four points to the Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals imprisoned their leadership in a traditional gambling fight against the United States.
Europe leads Ryder Cup in Paris at a point of 10-6, while the twelve twin games are still ahead on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four quadruple games launched on Saturday, and in the four-game of the afternoon, the profits were equal to 2-2.
The leaders of Europe were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four fights played as their partners on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had reached the same.
On Sunday, the twin is looking for more history.
No European player has won five points in one of the Ryder Cup, and even the Americans have been able to get into this as three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
The HJK condemns his supporters' harsh harsh harsh harsh interference in the Honka game: "People is not part of football"
On Sunday, HJK published a newsletter condemning its supporters' disruption behaviour in the FC Honka game in Tapiola on Saturday.
"We are calling for events after the Honka-HJK game on behalf of our supporters," says the bulletin.
At the end of the match, some 50 HJK supporters crossed the field, and some seemed to try to challenge a fight with Honga’s supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The orders did not get the situation to calm down, but there were cops and also horsemen.
HJK tells in its information that the team players and staff are shocked about what happened.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of our 11-year-old society.
"We are firmly distracted from any action that threatens the safety of the battle events," states the press release.
The HJK authorised to assist the authorities and organisers of the event in identifying the security threats and removing minorities.
The supporter culture is a part of football and an important issue for the HJK.
We all support positive, happy and encouraging activities in football opinions.
"This isn't the subject of violence," says the press release.
A Filipino inventor flys on a drone car, avoiding traffic congestion.
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, a hip-hop dancer, and some kind of Pelle Fearton.
He now belongs to the crowd growing in the world, who swears he's invented a flying car... or at least his own version of it.
As rivals, he has factors like Audi and Airbus, for example.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, the man has used a large part of his assets to build his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight, he flagged his device at a height of more than seven metres.
One of his aims was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the device gives rise to positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago. Mendiola said, "The British Daily Mail."
JHL predicts: Working fights starting tomorrow are visible in child day care and social and health services
In public and well-being sectors tomorrow, the prohibitions of overtime and shifting will be reflected in social and health services as well as child day care, as JHL President Päivi Niemi-Laine estimates.
The effects will be broad, and they will certainly appear in such a way that there is not enough staff present.
Everyone's gonna have to think about the way he's picking up his kids.
The task of the employer is now to ensure that services are playing and no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to the STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the weakness of the workers was also seen at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from overtime and switching due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through flexibility that the staff has not been hired but that workers have been overtime or switched.
This is not yet a work fight.
At work safety, it is normal for every worker to worry about and only be done for regular working hours.
JHL is opposed to the government's intentions to reduce the protection of redundancies for small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, the labour market manager of municipal employers, will not pre-evaluate the impact of overtime and switch-over bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very molluscistic, even though services may weaken.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and made the preparations that can be done.
The area is so wide, social and health activities and the technical sector that is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary greatly by industry, region and employers, Jalonen said to the STT.
Jalonen says that last week experience has already been gained, among other things, with regard to the activities of Super and the Social and Health Professional Organization, which lasted three days.
Their effects were rather small.
The prohibition of overtime and shifting of JHL applies, among other things, to workers in municipalities, churches, state and private social and health sectors.
For example, family day caregivers are excluded.
At this stage, the work fight concerns almost 100 000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Line, JHL's actions may last for a long time.
The Alliance has also prepared for other activities in the fight against employment if the redundancy law continues to be prepared.
The government should now admit that we're running into a wall and a hard run.
In the view of the process, both the Ay movement and the government must come back.
That's how special it is that the hard ones are already on the line, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalone will update.
The Great Korallirius is born with the strength of children and adults, studying cranes and sea horse gestures in the fitness circles of the performance
In other premises, the Great Korallirius, the Collective, received its first night last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kannelalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Koralliriut is a work that is built from the start to the end together with the public.
This time, however, a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and reproduce the findings made in the initial practice.
In the theater plays, there is also a lot of sadunical magic for children's attendants.
The child’s perspective has already been taken into account in the preparation of the work.
However, the great Korallirimus is not a child presentation, but a performance that adults and children make in co-operation.
It gives adults knowledge and observations of children’s manner of receiving information and making art.
The ability of children to throw themselves in internships and joint games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The great Korallirius reminds us of a certain amount of sadballet, fitness circle and nature-related information attacks, but it is finally stimulating in different, non-human conditions around visits.
The Great Korallirimus begins to learn about the movements of corals and corals.
The six different fitness circuits teach among other things crude and sea horse gestures.
Finally, a show of less than an hour is made where music, lights, shining paints and suits help to get to know the life of a coral ribbon.
There are both diving people in the great Koralliriut who are watching the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being examined.
There are also organisms that look at the corals.
Views and observations shown in many directions make the performance a thick and steep of life.
Whether to be a landscape, a landscape-looking creature, and another creature or landscape, and all of this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem so difficult.
In other places, the group is working towards the limit of thinking and action, which is challenging when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, Sitrator will have a quiet demonstration on behalf of the threatened corals.
Destructions beyond human understanding should not be hardened, even though it may be difficult to understand the importance of exercising compassion in the face of disaster.
In other places, the work has been built so that it respects the diversity of life, even with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are different kinds of knowledge, other species, and future generations of those whose miracles and plays it will erase.
The kids grow up too fast... I'm glad my childhood had no smartphones.
Children and young people today are even more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking when they are younger and younger.
I think children should be children for the whole time of their childhood, and they shouldn't mess their lives with drugs and sex because others say they do.
I was humiliated when my friend told me that he had been forced to pick up his sister in the fifth grade this weekend from a "boyfriend."
When she came to pick up her obsessed sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I couldn't imagine my own sister being in the same situation because we have been told and warned all our childhood that you shouldn't touch drugs and that sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today's children would be able to live a proper childhood, and they would not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by their friends.
I keep seeing younger girls in Instagram who are wearing makeup on their faces and reveal their clothes on.
Snapchat is used for taking and sending photos that reveal in the evening.
It's harder to guess how old girls are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look like 18 and older people.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad my childhood had no smartphones.
I was a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what others thought about me.
Yle: Authorities have told the State Command that the Airstoin Helmi is not related to national security
According to the Ilkka Kanerva interviewed, the Defence Police and the Defence Forces went to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish Head of State has been informed that Airisto Helme's investigation is currently not related to national security, but to organised crime, news is Yle.
Information on anonymous sources was confirmed by Mr Yle, Chairman of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (Kok).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Defence Police went to the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is predominantly regarded as an economic crime.
They were quite tight about not speculating that there was something else, Kanerva commented in Yle's interview.
According to the information above, no evidence of a link with national security has been found to date on the material in custody, but the investigation has only started.
There is no way we can yet know what can be revealed, says one of Ylen’s interviews.
A week ago, extensive home search on the island and continent of Turku has raised the question of whether the investigation is merely about economic crime or a threat to the internal security of Finland.
Earlier this week, the evening magazine prepared a case that goes through allegations both in favour and against.
Video: The dream painting saved Liverpool's defeated series
Liverpool's 100% Valoliga start ended, but it was still more satisfied with team 1-1 at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, the same year that Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped to a 1-0 guest victory.
Then the combination of Pep Guardiola sent a signal to the entire Valeoliga that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool's manager Jürgen Klopp arrived with the same idea in West London.
The Reds had started with the six consecutive wins of Valoliiga.
Liverpool started a stronger start, and in particular Virgil van Dijk seemed to rule alone after his end of the field.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a nice, worn league win from Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the exchange bank to solve the battle with a wonderful individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved right from the first few minutes.
In 25 minutes, he first balled in a small state with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croatian saw Hazard swing forward and sent him a fully-established pass.
Hazard went a bit to the bottom of the penitentiary, but he bombed a perfect left foot to the back corner of the bet.
The half of the brass guard, Alisson, was a little slow in his fight, and he didn't get his finger on the ball.
The clown must have felt the loss position lightly unrighteous, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger dropped Mo Salah from the target line of guidance.
During the second period, Kepa, Chelsea's trucker, was also able to do the real thing.
The Baskike watch quickly responded to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the top to the corner.
On the other end, Alisson turned off by throwing himself through Hazard's door.
The best place for the guests came in 72 minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firmino focused.
However, the Brassian star's bag was headed towards the country teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' leadership.
Even in the 89th minute, the exchanger Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot at 25 meters.
Sturridge played with his old home studio, and the attacker bombed it to honor an unresisted bet to the top corner.
Liverpool's 100% too-start ended on 1-1-stage, but it's still too fast - with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship with two points behind the tips.
In the clock transfer discussion, the potheras are deep.
I remember a decade ago, a magazine asked various Finnish figures that distribute the people of Finland.
Juice Leskise's answer was the only one in mind: Nen.
Some of the last names have a nose and some do not.
Well, there's a barbecue that can be born anywhere, and there's one waiter here.
Finland has made it possible for the EU to give up the annual clock transfer.
Many agree that the shift of watches twice a year has been foolish and has caused a wide range of problems.
Eventually, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest step of the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
It is now the hardest way to resolve what time is finally to come: the current summer or winter or another time zone.
This is also the way for the people to say their opinions on the host.fi page.
The question has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open to Friday, 12 October.
The debate is steeply held in coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a word to say.
Under the influence of the morning light, the winterers defend their position with the effect of the sunlight, defending the well-being of people and the sand with the effect of the night light on the desire of people to extern and thus wellbeing.
Both positions have strong supporters and good arguments.
According to research, the morning lights are cramping the day of man and giving us refreshment.
On the other hand, if not particularly suffering from waking up in the dark, lighting increases the movement of people outside and provides opportunities for, for example, autumn yards.
The amount of additional light after the normal working day has already been calculated for the hour.
I'd prefer to take both, but the bad thing is, we can't do anything in the north side of the earth.
Winters are too dark, and summers are too bright for many anyway.
It is typical for a debate on this topic that is driven by its own view and that the other's view is very strongly opposed.
The argument of the counterparty isn't exactly listening, because the most important thing is how it feels about yourself.
Because almost everyone has an opinion on this, it is worth trying to turn one’s head around.
It's burning the stairs.
The subject is extremely easy to argue, because it does not require a great stance and there is enough muntu-consciousness to justify it.
These kinds of issues are usually more controversial and equally infertile.
It's a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but I guess it's gonna fit in.
And it always offers an appropriate sinner if life feels narrow.
Josba fought for the host win
Josba’s first guest game at the Salibandyn Divar produced full three serial points against Nurmon Yumy.
Josba left the Wall River on her home trip with a 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
The lawn still led on the goal at the beginning of the third batch, but Josba sought compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47, the brothers Pretu and Juso Lehtininiemi plotted 6-5 wins.
In the ice of both teams, crucial minutes were played in the flat.
The most effective of Josha was Juuso Lehtininiemi (2+1).
The two chains were still fierce when Teemu Ashkanen (1+1), Jere Cardinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) were also hit.
Michael Kosonen also (1+0) played his goal at the time of birth in the second chain.
Yosba has six points after three rounds.
Next, O2-Yyväskylä will be welcomed in two weeks.
The 200th anniversary at the Eno church on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of the Church of Eno will be partly celebrated on Sunday in very sad moods.
A week ago, the burning of the Church of Enthusiasm danger was a shock.
The church of Eno was guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, there's still a party tonight.
Although no one would like that, the Church of Eno is now the oldest church of the Joensuu congregation.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite all the municipalities and other connections in the world.
The family fair starts at Eno's church tonight at 10:00.
Then we move to the congregation house by the cattle’s cattle table.
There's a lot in the program all day, inside and outside.
For example, Ari Räsässäsen, who has retired in the church building for 37 years as a congregation champion.
The church’s birth celebration also means the end of one era.
Already unused, the church house built in 1982 will open its door for the last time today.
Now we're in a distant building in the former municipal house, the Kappaist Markku Koistinen says.
The church has destroyed internal air problems, but the church has been standing healthy for 200 years.
Elon Musk is distracting from the head of the Tesla government, and the charges for fraud were settled for 40 million dollars.
Tesla, electric car manufacturer, and CEO Elon Musk have agreed their case with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority SEC.
The SEC doubted that Muski was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being displaced because of the company he set up.
But Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk will have to get away from the chairman of the Tesla Government for three years.
The company will be forced to hire the President of the external government.
Musk is also under stricter control.
According to the agreement, Teslan will have to hire two independent leaders and further monitor Musk's communications.
In addition, Tesla and Musk are both paying $20 million (approximately €17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market disturbances and damage to Tesla shareholders," says Director Steven Peikin SEC.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secured.
The suite just picked up Tesla's stock exchange.
The SEC suspected that Muski was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the Agency, the TV was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with other company managers or potential donors.
In practice, the Agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that he would sue the company and Musk.
SEC stated that it would require Musk to be sentenced to fines and that he would not be allowed to operate in the management of the stock exchange companies anymore.
The SEC challenge frightened investors, and Tesla's share went to a strong fall.
More than 800 people died in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami
In the earthquake in Indonesia and in the tsunami, the number of deaths has risen to at least 832, says the country disaster agency, according to the AFP.
It is believed that the number of deaths will continue to increase, because it is still underway to solve the damages.
Vice-President Jusuf Kalla said that the final figure could rise to thousands.
On Friday, the earthquake brought up a tsunami attacking the city, please, on the island of Sulawes.
However, immediately after the beast, the tsunamis was given a warning, which was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known dead are at least now from the Call.
The rescue authorities are concerned, inter alia, about the Donggala region near the vicinity centre, where the situation is still largely unclear.
A number of people are already known to die.
Ranish Aid Requests
The Indonesian army has been alerted to rescue workers to seek victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the Destruction Area today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue work without exhausting the days and nights.
One of the centers of the rescue works is the hotel in Palu, which is believed to have 50 to 60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, Head of the Rescue Service, said that one of the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel favoured by business tourists was able to survive at night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told us.
According to the Cyaug, a heavy harvest fish would be quickly needed in the ceramic and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find people who are missing.
Help me, you at the Palu and nearby.
My friend's family's still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook group.
Politian phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublers in Britain
Many British politicians were subject to harassment when their contact information was published because of the deficiencies in the application encryption.
The malfunctioners received access to the ministers’ telephone numbers.
It was the application used at the British Conservative Party meeting in the Government.
For example, Michael Gove, Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson were subject to harassment.
There were a number of people who received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the application, the public received access to the profiles of politicians at the annual conference of the Conservative Party on mobile access.
The audience had access to the profiles by using a politician's email address, which was readily available online.
The profile logging was able to view and edit the material recorded in the profile.
Someone managed to switch Boris Johnson into a profile picture for a moment, and I insulted the title.
Michael Goven's profile picture was replaced by a media mole of Rupert Murdoch's image.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to sign in to other people's profiles using these e-mail addresses.
Then you can look at the contact details of the profile person and send messages in this name.
The meeting application was made by every journalist, politician and participants in the telephone number of the public, Foster criticized.
The Conservative Party informant apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British Information Authority, ICO, supports the leak.
The application was drawn up by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The working party in the opposition criticizes that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland visit to the audience has a large number of applauded Polish people every week
Observed viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience in the Wall Finland Visiting Programme.
Worldwide rapidly spread US format The Wall landed on the Finnish version of Nelo last Saturday.
Heikki Paasose hosted game show is described in Poland in the same studio where other international productions are made in format.
In the Polish studio, the opportunities were exceptional, as the format’s large 12-metre high game walls required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, the social media highlighted the studio audience of the programme, which was considered Polish.
On Twitter, there would be a discussion about whether the Polish people might understand anything about a game that plays in Finnish.
The head of the four domestic programmes, Unne Ringunen, illustrates the issue to the evening press.
He tells us that the studio is close to players, other Finns, Finns living in Poland and only Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international tamperers in Finnish production, just as the audiences of the The Wall periods described in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such populations, the so-called professional populations who are in different programs, and the Ringune is depicting them.
He reminds us that following the game in itself is not so difficult, even if it does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to separate.
However, there are interpretations for foreigners in the studio that carry out the translation work.
There are two translators that interpret as a simultan translator to the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then guides the audience and tells us what kind of laptop is being thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Ringunen says.
He compares the situation with the way David Hassellhoff was used in domestic production back then.
David Hassellhoff was a few years ago involved in Talent Finland's descriptions with us in Finland.
He had the whole time a simultan equation in his ear, and he knew everything that was spoken in the descriptions in Finnish, the sum of the Ringune.
The tifoon of the southern parts of Japan is moving towards the main islands - the authorities warn us about landings and floods
The authorities also warn you about possible land hauls and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifun Tram, but, according to the authorities, large injuries have been avoided and there are no data on the victims.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK general broadcasting company, people have been evacuated in shelters, and more than 300 000 households have lost electricity.
More than a thousand flights have been canceled, and the bullet trains are stationaryly stopping because of the storm.
The storm is expected to strike close to Osaka at half a day in Finland.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but there are also strong winds and rains.
The train stations have been canceled in Tokyo today.
According to weather scientists, Trami's going to torture Japan until Monday.
The Heaven of Aces became darker
The beginning of the Aces has been bad.
Heaven's darkness was almost black on Saturday when the team lost on their home field 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) for Vaasa Sport.
The Porils now have five successive losses, and there are two points in total for six rounds.
No Assistor or two lower chain player has yet to finish.
The pressures are also growing all the time.
At the moment, almost half of the game was left.
Six games are only played, and of course, there is no reason to give up.
Of course, you have to be worried, because that's what we were playing.
Especially the second round show was a disgraceful bad one, and Jarno Kärki, who made the power 1+2 for the Aesi, told me.
Of course, it tasted like a win for sport.
The team had a game down from Friday, so he would have thought it would be visible.
Well, maybe it did, but Asses didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors on the bread day continued to grow
Mother of the breadday Pirkko Juarinen wonders about the audience of the event at the big gym.
Somehow, he thought maybe this year there wouldn't be so many people. He'll think about it in the morning.
In autumn 2017, together with the bread day, the SM contests were held at the Traktor Penn, so it might be expected that the audience could even fall slightly from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were already stunned before ten, the sellers reported that the products had ceased, the news drill was sold more than 500 doses, and the number of cars was heard of an increase.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6,000, and Juarinen will tell us later this afternoon.
In the morning and the afternoon, five hours, there were particularly many programs for children’s families, which, I think, attracted them to a record ball.
In addition, Hearinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
The sellers also carve Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, the rapporteurs, traders of crafts, baking and harvesting products had arrived almost a hundred.
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Juarinen, enjoyed the audience in the hall view.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series Teija Kivinieme's beautiful bread won the public vote.
The children’s bread competition arrived with 11 different forms of bread.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, the winner of the rose bread competition, spent the day at the martian pie.
7 x the most beautiful lighting light - from this you will recognize a good lamp
Wake up the space, create the right atmosphere for indoors, and read the book without getting tired.
It's worth raining for a good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The Vinkis gave Innolux's sales and marketing director, Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do Your Eyes a favor
The importance of lighting is increasing, the more ages there are behind.
Sufficient light can help many people with problems of age, as visual precision is reduced and more and more shivering.
Parents also increase the need for light.
Sixty-fives need light three times more than the 20th.
Thus, it is worth squeezing on the effects of the light and the characteristics of the light for health reasons already.
A good lighter gives enough light, but not shine, Jokiniemi tip.
Create the beauty around you
Beautiful decoration can only come out with correct lighting solutions.
The decorator of the moment has the right to choose.
In the popularity, there is a Japanese style that combines scandalousness and Japaneseism.
On the other hand, from the '70s, the modern and play retrotyl with strong colours, metal with different shades or ice cream colors have risen to buum.
Reality is fascinated in the same way as in other home decorations.
The materials now display wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more is now spent on home than before, and decoration has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of masquerade production, they want a tailored, even a bold lighter with a story to tell.
People are clearly seeking Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be well-conscious about design, says Jokiniemi.
It is not necessarily the latest trend lighting, but the timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain types of timeless, horny and elegant classics keep their surfaces from year to year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and good-bye!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian warrior after three games.
Comrade and attacker Brendan O'Donnell's paths are separated.
The Canadese Ripper played three League games in orange patterns without power points, KooKoo tells us in his communications.
In August, O'Donnell moved to KooKooho with a one-year agreement, which included a test period lasting until the end of September.
During the last period, a 26-year-old attacker played at KHL in the lines of Kunlund Red Star and at the KHL farm in VHL KRS Heilongjiang.
I don't know about O'Donnell's new company yet.
A player wants to show an example of recycling - the goods are going to the world in recycling boxes, the plastic switched into paper
The game special business The gameman is now recycling, not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the stone-foot shop customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made from recycling material.
Products ordered for online trade are packed, for example, in packages from importers.
All the packages that come to us go back to re-use.
We may use boxes a dozen times as long as the package is in such a condition that it can be used, Ville Puurula of Oulun Pelimieh.
As a softening material, the company uses mainly newspapers and similar recycling materials.
Cupface doors are avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we will also move to recycling material in the envelopes.
The business wants to show examples to others.
Recycleing is not an extra effort, according to Purula.
There's no big problem starting to recycle.
It will also bring economic savings when, for example, cardboard packages are reused.
Recycleing is naturally suitable for the gameman’s activities, as the key product range of new products includes, among other things, the games and equipment used.
All fashion-consuming: The same shirt works in every suit
Classical clothes work from season to season in other suits than in costume.
They create the basis of a good garderobe in their multi-use nature, as it is easy to collect various costly suits around high-quality classics.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the garbage cabinet are high-quality needles.
This category also includes the black pool.
Black needles made of natural material can not have a mistake.
The clothing can be combined with direct trousers, boredoms and jeans, and it can be created both with a controled housing and a filthy style.
Halfoneule is suitable for both a modern dresser and a classical stylish artist.
This is how you create a style.
In the autumn, the trend of the fall is born of golden brown and wide-sized blind meth suits, black poloneules and gray ankles.
The classic Poloneule, together with other classics, blue - green scotch and wine - red licensing, constitutes a female and sophisticated housing.
Brings a shrink in a black poolule by combining it with the trendy clothes of the relaxation: a jeans skirt, high boots and thick panties.
Young and stylish!
The sabotage activities of Russian intelligence services have a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this practice.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian-speaking Diversionno-razvedivovadine group: sabotage and intelligence team.
Agents of the Security Service of the Soviet Union in the West of the KGB prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and in the early 21st century.
These targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and housing for the DRG groups for undercover operations in the Bundeswehr, railways, wildlife guards and road workers.
This trick was used by Russian parachutes in the Crimea in February 2014: they dressed for local Ukrainian police cranes, set up inspection stations from the Nemima to Ukraine for you and isolated the Krim's motherland.
Agents of the Cold War were hiding for sabotage teams with mines, explosives, lighters, and communications.
In 1998 there was still a secret of the KGB found in Switzerland, which was exploded by the injected by the authorities with a water shuttle.
At night, the police reached four driving drunks in the county.
The police caught four cycling drinks across the North Karelia in the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, a 18-year-old man in the Gulf blows 1,57 promilles.
He drove two passengers at the beginning of the Cajaanites at 6:30 a.m.
With the Knee Lake Chorevaarat, the car was dripping around four o'clock in the stream, and the 19 - year - old local man alone in the car blew up 1,54 promilles, according to the police.
He didn't have any serious injuries on his way out.
A 20-year-old exterior man, driving a passenger car in the centre of a strange rubber, blew into an alkometer of 1,33 promilles.
The police suspect these male drivers of the turbulence of the wheel and the driver of the Polviärvi Lake, in addition to the danger of road safety.
On Saturday morning at Tuupopavara, a 36-year-old man transported a local van in the middle of the Ölläääääänt and Hoikakantee was blown in 0.52 promilles.
He's being suspected of a driving beverage.
The police are asking for observations of the stab at the Turk Railway Station after midnight.

The police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Riska in line for the rest of the year, and Lehtinen's test time ends
Mika Toomala, the sports director of Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (centre.) has been important for the team in initiatives, underpower play and defending the Fourth Field.
Philip Riska, played in the early fall of the experiment, continues the rest of the rest of the year in Hämeenlinna's HPK.
The success of experienced Riska 33, the success of the roles offered to him, assured the follow-up.
Philip has been an important piece of initiative, underpower play and a four-field defence role for us.
Although there is still something to improve, it is good to hold on to the young team this experienced player, Mika Toulla, the sports director of the HPK, commented in the newsletter of the company.
The hope is that Riska's value is rising when the hockey League's solution games are playing.
The central warrior from Pietar Island, Riska, has been playing lately in JYP, Luko and Sport.
Instead, Oskar Lehtinen, the negotiator, was left without a contract after the trial.
The real story on TV today: The climber was left twice to die.
The American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journal Home From Everest is based on man’s own experience.
They've made the film tonight on the basis of it.
Everest now gets his pre-night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, the devastating snowstorm surprised the climbers at Mount Everest.
The direction of Baltasar Kormákur 2015 tells about the survival game, which has been treated cereally.
The tragedy has been made of movies and documents before.
True events are also being conducted in this case.
The highest mountain in the world took eight climbers' lives 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced leaders of excursions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
That's right. Hall was the guide of Weathers.
Weathers' life could be saved by an eye surgery carried out before leaving Nepal.
As a result of this and the pressure of the air, he lost his sight, so the peak invading had to be ignored.
Rob Hall went on, and he didn't come back.
Yet, the struggle against life and death at Weathers had just begun.
When the storm came up, she lost her way and found her back in the camp.
When they came to find him, he was found in such a bad condition that he wasn't believed to survive.
Weathers was left to die.
It was like a miracle at the store, though, he still got on his feet and found the others.
The badly cold Weathers was thought to continue to die, and once again he was left on his own fortune.
It's clear that against other kinds of expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, also fellow - climbers began to believe in the possibility that he was given help.
In the life picture, Beck Weathers is pretending to be Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today, the 200-year-old Eno church has been celebrated.
The 200-year-old Church of Eno has been celebrated today in the church.
The church was dedicated on October 4, 1818, and for the celebration of the year, the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
At the Eno church hill, the celebration started at 10 a.m. with the cattle’s cattle tables at Eno’s parish house.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family fair.
The Lord of the Church, Eno, Armi Rautavuori, was delighted that so many people had come to the church.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to work, Rautavori (in the picture) says.
Many people have been touched by the fire of the Church of Aggression, and it was not missed at the 200th anniversary of the Eno congregation.
The Church of Eno is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran congregations in Joensuu after the destruction of the Church of High - Temperament.
In 1770, the wooden church of the War of Aggression graduated.
In the morning, a ceremony was held where the destructed church was slowed down and remembered in a fire.
Pictures and videos: The medican flashed his power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street became a river
A powerful storm of the hurricane type swept from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane or medicane is called Zorba.
The Greek Air Science Institute has provided a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnesus, the Joonian Islands, Kyklad and Kreta.
Photos taken from the region show abundant floods around Greece.
The video on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kiato in the region of Corinth instead of the street because of floods.
Another video shows how the car has been transported by flood water.
In the southern part of the Peloponnesus peninsula, a heavy wind caused intense seafare.
The Finnish Embassy of Athens guides people on their Facebook pages to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The delegation invites the monitoring of weather communications and local authorities' instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medicane, brings heavy rains and even a flood risk.
According to a study published by CNN in 2011, medians appear only once or twice a year throughout the world, typically on the roads of September to October, while sea temperature is still high.
The storm that was blowing left behind floods in Tunisia and Libya before travelling north and towards Europe.
Refuge camps have also caused concern in Greece, such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
In the summer, areas destroyed by landtops in the Athens environment will also remain under the storm.
In Greece, the medican was riled last November.
We don't have to go to the sea now, but the flights in its schedule... on the Greek islands that are threatened by the storm, there are thousands of Finns on holiday.
The journeys to the sea are canceled, and even when walking, it is worth careful not to fly branches or other bulk goods in a storm.
Such guides have been distributed to fair 3 500 Greeks for a Finnish weekend holiday through sun trips.
Instructions will be needed because even the scary Zorbas storm has been predicted to sweep the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Kreta, wind speed can rise in the wooden trees up to 45 metres per second.
The weather's prosperity is increased by heavy rains.
All passengers travelling through the Sun and Tuin from Finland to Greece, who have notified their phone number, have been warned about heavy wind by SMS according to travelling operators.
Still sun and heat in the air
According to Inka Ikosen, a solar communications expert, on Saturday at the beginning of the holiday destinations has been avoiding the worst.
For example, flights have landed and have risen according to normal schedule.
Of course, we're watching the situation all the time.
Security ahead, let's go.
Antonia Schroderus, a media surgeon, tells me that their flights have traveled on schedule too.
We are constantly in contact with our target staff.
At least Kreta was still calm, she told me about the beginning of the night on Saturday.
At present, the most popular Greek islands, i.e. Rodos and Kreta, have a total of 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, few hundreds of passengers are holidays in smaller places.
For example, the worst storm on Kos Island is likely to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodos had ridiculed the sun, and the temperature tended to 27 degrees, says the Icon of Sun Passengers.
It is estimated that Zorbas is going to be the next trumpet in Turkey, although slightly reduced.
In case of this, we have already contacted Turkey and our staff there, and we have reviewed, for example, the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tu, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvisa and Janni Hussilla have completely identical night costumes in the Missifinal, so they react to the situation.
The media person and the fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Suomi final on Saturday in an open night suit.
Hussi tells me he bought a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust professionals who found me a perfect suit for this evening, Hussi's smiling.
Just the same silver evening suit had also been chosen by the pimp Shirly Karvinen.
The twin himself also noticed the same costumes and looked at the situation laughing.
Karvinen told the evening-Sanom that he came in a hurry to prepare, and he had to put himself on a plane.
Hussi works as a backstage and red carvet drinker in the Missifinal, and he talks about the stars that arrive.
There's a fresh move behind the Hussi because he moved from Kamp to Puppy Island on Friday.
I'm gonna stay there for now. Let's see what happens.
Essentially, the new apartment has its own office, Hussi thought.
Before he moved, Hussi traveled alone in Greece.
It was lovely. I was only in a hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When stress got out, I got a flu, but otherwise my vacation was really successful, Hussi tells me.
Shirly Karvisen's behavior in a plane brought a lot of attention to gathering curious eyes on pensioners.
The contractor and Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen 2016 told her that she had enough to do with radio drinks and Love Island Finland.
In such a way that Karvinen has reached the finale directly from Finnair’s flight.
I made the makeup and put the hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
The night change at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says she's pulled out her makeup in the middle of pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of the visitors.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
It was fun to make my makeup, at least for others.
Karvinen flys to Spain once a week.
At Marbella, he'll be spending a few days at a time.
Karvinen tells us that she enjoyed her washing as a director of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience to date as a stopper.
Karvinen says she went to see the singles of the program on Friday.
In some way, it's really raw.
They're people's real feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of singles in the program.
How am I dressing overknobs?
Three Perfect Examples
Classical clothes are clothes that work from the season to the other dress.
The classics are often decades old, but sometimes more modern individuals can be included.
A few years ago, the over-generation soaps that have risen into the hips of the autumn and winter season have not gone anywhere.
According to their name, the boots that surround the knee are repetitive from year to season to year.
The boots appear to share the opinions of the users, but the brave model is worth a try, no, boldly.
For example, overages are actually suitable for all sorts of housing.
It's either a jeans, a lace, a chicken or a tricoon, a chimple leather or an artificial skin surface of boots.
Long boots look good, both in the ceremony and in the living suits.
Black overknobs are suited to very gentle housing.
They rightly balance the feminine nature of a pink, flower plise, and a gentle, stubborn needle.
It's a crude but autumnly stylish uniform for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-engine housing comes from a long, copper-brown dress, overknives, visible earrings, and a pinch bag.
Although overknobs have a certain delicateness, they are perfectly suited to the normal dress together with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy box.
It's lovely easy, and yet so stylish!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and take passengers, the city of Espoo will inform you.
Otaniemi's robot cars play the role of a bus simulator, as the next spring of the region is intended to start traffic on a robot bus.
The project will develop and pilot robotic vehicles throughout the year and test the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The experiment finds out how robot cars can handle the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, Head of Transport Management.
For the first time, robot cars will automatically travel in other transports without special transport arrangements.
The safety of the vehicles is always the responsibility of the driver sitting on the vehicle.
Vehicles perceive their environment on several different sensors and assess whether the road is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether there has been an obstacle to the vehicle, bicycle or, for example, snow wings, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4 responsible for the development of robot transport.
Robot cars travel throughout the autumn three days a week: Tuesday from 13 to 15.30 p.m., Wednesdays from 10 to 15 p.m. and Thursday at 10 to 15 p.m.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers.
The parking lots on the robot cars can identify the parking marks.
I'm sure you'll be able to get in from the parking lot in Otakare, number 1.
The bassist of the mokoma group fell off the stage in the middle of a job and was injured.
Mokoma Group will inform you about the surprising situation on its Facebook pages at the Tampere Package Room show.
A mokoma-to-unit show in Tampere Packet Room received a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the band bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage.
It happened when the band was pulling the last song of the night.
The spider's wrist broke.
The band will inform you on its Facebook pages.
"We're breathing!"
The santa stumbled last night at the Packet Room in the last song and broke his wrists.
Let's hope for a quick healing for a metal brother!
The rest of the tours will be handled with substitutes on the pages.
The fans of the mocoma respond with concern to the photo update, where the bassist-Santtu lays the gips in his hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, it was pretty hard to worry about how bad it happened.
The relief is great, the bones will be healed fortunately in time.
Push and quick recovery to Santu and a good tour to the other band plus the cruiser!
And thank you for yesterday's, great job, but you promise to leave this strong dramatic job out of the future?
Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The East Finland Police Department carried out hunting control on Friday and Saturday with the Forest Government and Finland's Wildlife Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police officers reported in social media on Saturday.
The main weight of control was in hunting lawfulness and authorisation.
A hunting card and a national hunting permit were checked for each hunter.
In addition, the authorisations for the possession of hunting weapons and the permissible number of self-loading weapons used in sewerage were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were checked during the surveillance, and only one hunter met during the inspection, who lacked the required hunting permit.
The hunter was ordered 12 days of unauthorized request.
In addition, the police blew 133 vehicle drivers, and two of them were suspected of driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic violations in the criminal proceedings, the police times.
To summarise, hunters are very good in keeping with hunting's permits.
A lot of hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said, "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting control in the autumn, together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykainen goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of Interior Kai Mykänen (kok.) travels to Turkey in the next few days to follow the choice of future quota refugees in Finland.
In Finland, 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps have been decided this year.
Election trips are usually taken a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR) will first select those who are particularly vulnerable to the condition.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single parent families, people with disabilities and sick people, women and children.
In Finland, more people will be selected for the future group than the quota is, because in practice some of them will not arrive for different reasons.
Mykärne also sees the NGOs operating on the border with the Turkish Minister of Interior, Süleyman Soylu and Syria.
Ilkka Salmi, Head of Office of the Ministry of Interior, is also involved.
Speaking of lifting the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, there have been 750 refugees per year.
For a few years, the quota was 1 050 years, but the government has not since been able to agree to raise it.
The assembly has been in favour of raising the quota, but the project has last fallen against blue people.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centric) recently presented a gradual increase in quotas to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
This is the first time that the Minister of Interior will take the place to monitor the choice of quota refugees.
The former Ministers of Interior Petter Orpo (Kok.) and Paula Risikko (Kok.) were able to move to their new assignments before the visits were scheduled.
Finland will receive €10 000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugees.
Now we're going to the barns, and we don't know anymore if we're crying or laughing
Last Saturday, the Herder was in the news about the bill to change the animal protection law.
The article concluded that the draft law in principle prohibits the holding of all animals which are not authorised separately by ministerial regulations as production animals, pets or other business activities.
So everything else is essentially banned except the animals mentioned separately in the Regulation.
If the legislative proposal ends up in law, it should mean that we are rejecting the general principle in Western Democrats that the law separately prohibits action that jeopardises the security of society or a good way of doing so.
It is now on the basis of a ban on all activities that are not authorised separately by law or regulation.
The change is that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business activities and do nothing other than the law or regulation which it adopts.
The government’s activities in the preparation of law have generally been weak.
If we are now going to the road that, in principle, everything is banned in Finland, which is not allowed separately, we are no longer aware of whether to cry or laugh.
I don't think the animal protection law would require an update.
But the legal project in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I think that it is acceptable to this "all is banned, which is not permitted by law or regulation separately".
I hope there is a reasonable minister who will stop this kind of legal project.
Metti Forsell whistle: The four most trendy skirts in the autumn
This fall's trendy outfit comes in snakes.
It looks particularly good in just the skirts.
Combine a snake-faced skirt with the more gentle upper parts, such as a pool or a normal t-shirt, so that the whole body stays stylish.
In this autumn, the silk can be seen richly, and in particular the silk skirt is one of the most trendy clothes in the season.
Connect the wonderful silk skirt with the female upper part in a delicate manner or relaxed with the needle.
You can play more bold with the silk ham and throw on the leg, for example, sneakers or autumn trendy cowboy boots.
It doesn't matter whether it's grey, brown or multifaceted, all of the crocheted skirts now belong to every woman's black hat.
Connect boldly a variety of colors to each other and play with the squares also on the top of the outfit.
For example, the combination of the scalpel and the ball is beautiful.
Asymmetry pearls are a blur from the lightness of the summer, which can be taken with them in the autumn.
The asymmetric flame is also feminine and plays, and it fits finely for both the face and the party.
♪ Baby Alexia, three months ♪ ♪ She's a sweet little girl ♪ ♪ She's gonna be in Jere's arms ♪
In the caralah family picture, there's a sweet, three-month baby Alexia.
Nanna Karalahiti will tell Kerava about the Aito Day Home set up.
The sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and Jere Karalahti, former icebreaker, 43, received a family increase at the beginning of July.
The first son of the couple, Jax, was 2 years old in May, while the little Alexia is just a three-month baby.
Nanna Karalahti recently held a training camp with Martina Aitohte in Marbella, Spain, with the entire Karalahti family.
Instagram, Nana published a picture of the Spanish atmospheres where the entire Karalahti family poses.
The kids Jax and Alex are in the arms of their parents.
I draw attention to the sweetly grinding Alexia baby that rests on the arms of his father Jere.
Thank you for that.
Appreciate kindness, forgiveness, human generosity and joy, writes Nanna Karalahti next to the family portret.

Turkey is invited to download mobile phones in case of a storm
The Zorba storm that blew in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists warned the seamen, fishermen and farmers of the western coast of the country about the Greek storm, writes CNN Turk.
The tropical storm is reported to move from south to north during the day.
On Saturday, the disaster and emergency authorities called on citizens to download their mobile phones before the storm and to ensure that Internet connections work so that people can receive timely updates of the situation, says the local news agency Anaduluja Timensi.
People have been urged to stay home and far from the windows and to move garden furniture away from the wind, for example.
Turkey is expected to have heavy rain and the wind is expected to blow in between 28 and 33 metres per second.
In Greece, red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Air Science Service provided a red weather warning to the regions of Attika, Peloponnesus, the Joonian Islands, Kyklad and Kreta in South Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Greek travel agencies warned the Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Ambassador also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were invited to follow weather information and local authorities’ instructions.
A while ago, when I contacted him, there was a lot of wind and it rained.
People were quite calm, the communications chief Laura Aaltonen from the Tui Travel Office told the STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as a similar one on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages from the affected Finns.
In Greece, several hundred ships did not operate on Saturday, told the local news office Amna.
The boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, and travel agencies were informed to the STT.
According to Finland’s Athens mission, there were temporary disturbances in aviation and shipping.
Finnair was reported on Saturday that the weather situation was being monitored actively.
Kimi Raikkonene crystallized the reason for Mercedes' better than Ferrari.
Ferrarin Kimi Räikkonen was allowed to admit that Mercedes, the worst competitor, was too hard at the time of the Russian gp.
However, there is no reason to fall into the panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but nothing huge is about it.
Our car was the best for the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, driven for the fourth, and with their stable partner, Sebastian Vetti, who clearly left the Mercedes lights, said Raikkonen.
Ferrari had a hard time at the last race in Singapore.
People asked what the sudden fall of Mercedes' ride is right.
They seem to go faster than we do - as simple as it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go in the same speed as they do.
But I don't know anything more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, there was a rare delicacy in the future of the Statue of Raikkönen with regard to Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, replacing the Ferrari next season, was the seventh, and the last time ajossa was also Marcus Ericsson.
For a Swedish driver, the tenth departure is the best for over three years.
And even though five drivers left in the second driving session completely unleashed, the result was still sweet for Sauber.
And perhaps in the light of the coming of the thrill?
Yes, if you compare with where they were from the first century, it's been a big step forward.
Next year, there's a different story, so let's see.
It was there, Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper, "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erka Teper's game at Stuttgart's evening was on the level.
The German was a more initiating party in the ring, but he couldn't get hit.
The clearer Helenius controlled the match with his hard series, which found it well.
The Finnish man was also clearly better physically than Teper.
Eventually, the solution came in the eighth batch when Helenius fell on his left side of Teper.
It was so hard that the coconut who fought in front of the household didn't even try to get up from the mat.
After confirmation of the victory, Helenius was very gentle.
At first, he commended the good mood and opponent created by the audience.
Then for a moment, he changed the Finnish language.
Thank you for all the viewers and Finnish enthusiasts.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius was happy right after the fight.
This was a really big victory for Helenius' career.
Perhaps there would be a chance to even get into the MM game, Helenius commented to the evening press before the match.
Instead, the death could have decided the entire boxing career.
Of course it's been in mind.
No more younger than this, the 34-year-old Helenius admitted before Teper met.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster can multiply
The Guardian magazine says that the Vice President of the country calls for a clear rise in the victim's number.
Vice-President Jusuf Kalla said that the total number of victims could rise to thousands.
Serious circumstances
The Saviors are looking for those who are trapped, as well as for those who have been killed in the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: please from the port city and its neighbourhood in Donggala.
So far, all victims are from the Call, there is still no clarity about the situation in Donggala.
Hundreds of people are missing, and about 540 have been hurt badly.
There are still people in the downhill buildings that the saviors have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has fallen.
Saviors say that they heard the screams of people who were trapped from the ruins, but the lack of harvesting fish has delayed the beginning of the rescue work.
President of Indonesia Joko Widodo has assigned an army to rescue and eradicate.
There is a need for the Army and its equipment, as electricity and communications interconnections in the disaster area are cut out in many places.
Fuel reserves are also exhausting.
Ms Suomi's vague response and long reflection caused a laughter
There's a new Miss Finland being selected at Billsin Ruuk.
In the interview, a question was asked for each of the Missisifinalists.
The finalists pulled the question about the glass skull on the stage.
Especially the finalist number six of Emilia Antikoske, 23, the suspicious response received sweet, but good -willed laughs at the audience.
The question to Antikosk had come through Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book the Missifinalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a long time before he began to hesitate.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read... Anttikoski said thinking.
The report break in the audience was laughing at the time of the laughter until Antikoski continued to answer:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books at school!
I'm sure it's some kind of economics-related.
So the last book I've read is an economic science of someone, Antikoski answered.
After his answer, Antikoski received the public with a laughing applause.
Earlier on the Mississicular Tour Antikoski raised attention, for he did not want to pose in his underwear because of his principle.
In 2018, Miss Finland will be crowned at 21.00 p.m. when the crown will be abandoned last year by Miss Suomi Michaela Söderholm.
♪ The horny appel tailcake ♪ ♪ With the tongue ♪
This recipe is for you who have good, acidified apples from their own backs, because the domestic apple is for shocking prices in the shop.
The beer may have to be bought, even though I think it's already growing up with the pear tree.
This cake can only be made of apples if you don't want to buy pears.
Of course, the taste is more versatile if the cake also has its pear.
Knive apples and pears and remove the seed blocks.
Screw it.
You can blend on the roof.
Sweep the eggs and sugar into foam and then add corn flour to the foam and butter.
Connect maize starch, i.e. maize and bread powder and add it to the pastry.
Add the strawberries and wheat flour, mix well.
Swallow the breadbed with baking paper, spray 2 liquor sugars on the bottom of the bed and spread pear sprays on sugar.
Sweeping half the mage on pears and apple blocks on the tooth.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Get cooked in the oven at 180 degrees about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Just let it get cold in the haul, and then you'll cancel the waitress.
Cut the cake until it's cool.
The cake is fragile in its structure and is easily broken because the magic has almond and maize flour without gluten.
A International Criminal Literature Event will be held in January
In January, Kuusamo Ruka will be held a first international literary festival focused on Nordic criminal literature.
The Nordic Noir event program consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary program numbers and jazz music.
As literary guests of the festival, the star Jens Lapidus of Swedish decary literature and the Swedish twin behind the name Erik Axel Sund are seen, among other things, by Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist.
In addition to Swedish names, authors are also seen from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
The Finnish writers are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the festival organisers, the northern location, nature, dark season and Kuusamo’s unique environment provide a framework for unique literary experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts of popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admiration?
The investigators of the University of Sydney analysed the matter have outlined two kinds of "cololius" of a slightly different nature: the most attractive coolness and, in this respect, the opposite dissident-coolity.
Fascinatingly cool people, according to the description of researchers, had many socially desired features: they were outward, friendly, harmonious, and qualified.
The dissidents were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion and pain.
They had a thirsty experience, and they only cared for the external estimates.
Both guys combined a good sense of self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of the harder is not beyond cool: high status in teenager age does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what an American survey published in 2014 in Child Development reports.
Young people who were early dating, partying, looking for good-looking gangs and seeking favor with others had an increased risk of using drugs and committing crimes when they were young.
In their relationships, they managed to cope less than in the past with their most unaware mates.
A high-status lock of buses, signal bags, or clocks don't make a person cool or, at least, genuinely attracting company.
In a study published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, most of the people were ready to make friends with their normal market shirts than with those wearing a badge, despite the fact that most people chose a sign shirt in the context of the visit.
If you're on Greek vacation islands, watch out!
There's a horror storm coming in here, the weather warning screams out of the red.
During the weekend in southern Greece, as much water can rain as in Finland during the average period of six months.
The Zorbas horror storm hits Greece during the weekend.
Prepare to stay in the area of Peloponnesus, the Joonian Islands, Kyklada or Kreta.
The storm is very powerful, so the Finnish Ambassador will report it on its Facebook pages.
According to the embassy, the Greek Air Science Service has given the regions a red weather warning.
The weather service at Foreca’s blog is also reported about the approaching storm.
According to that, the hardest hips in the storm are up to 45 metres per second.
As a result of comparison from the first week of Finland, the Kuusma storm blew up in its hardest 30 metres per second.
According to the blog, however, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
The weekend in South Greece can be more than 300 millimetres of water.
It is responsible for about half the annual amount of rain in Finland.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods to Tunisia and Libya this week.
Do you recognize the men skulled Love Island Finland -Ankku?
Shows with confusing Youtube videos
It is rare to know that in Love Island Finland, the beautiful Anku of many men is also present in the rare Youtube videos published in 2010 as an ascarté.
With videos Anku advises ascarters, among other things, to make the ink berries of old economic paper rolls.
The duck also shows its sympathetic style of how the pantyhose can ascertain a silk that grows with the right spikes.
Now, the Easter grass is made to grow, but let's do it in a little surprising way, the Anku insinuates and presents sawdust, stockings and the seeds of the crude that he makes on his wings.
You can watch videos from the bottom or the Anku Youtube channel from here.
Valteri Battas shattered and bursted adrenalin in Sotsh, is he going to be the helper of Hamilton on Sunday?
Valteri Battas shattered a bit more than ten minutes after his staircase of the Russian gp when he was in front of the media.
The great round left Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes' number one, and I'm sure it was a spiritually important criticism for the Finnish timer gathered this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the final round.
I feel good, I'm still a little shivering, Bootas figured it out.
I've only been on the stake once this year in Austria (middle), so time has passed quite.
This track has been good to me before, and I've had good tours again.
It's not easy to skip the Sotshi track, so leaving is a very big role.
And, of course, Battas was able to answer with curiosity, whether he drives a win tomorrow or whether there's a Hamilton yeshing approaching the MM note.
My starting point in the race is definitely trying to win.
When you leave the pole, there can be no other goal, Battas paalut.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' leadership in Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference in me is very big, so you have to keep it in mind.
Let's see what's going on, but Battas filled it up.
After the drive, Hamilton was genuinely happy about Botta's success, and toto Wolff, Mercedes' stable boss, too, had a taste.
Lewis was going to win the Valter, but he didn't make it.
Valter knows he has to rip everything from himself to win Lewis.
And he was so loaded that the adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff glowed.
The question is whether the stable puts Botta and Hamilton to drive straight, and Wolff responded.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
The crystalline Erno Kinnune reached the rally of the Finnish Championship
The SM series of Rally Cars ended rarely.
Hardly ever before, the brothers have ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done by the Tusulians Eerik and Henrik St. Petersburg in the district of Turku and Salo, as Erik won the class of SM1 and Henrik SM2.
The crystalline Erno Kinnune assured the best achievement of his career, when the third place of the final race embedded him from the SM4 class of the two-way cars of the Finnish Championship.
Kinnune, a competing man in Honda Civic, and Ville Mäkelä, started the Turku Participation Contest, as the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would guarantee a MS account.
In the darkness of Friday evening, the twin had to give an equilibrium when some of the supplementary lights failed with another special test.
It's got a little blind for a third piece.
In a situation like this, it's not a good thing to do.
Saturday was only followed by Jussi Tepo's speed in the second series, Kinnune told me.
Syria demands the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops.
The Syrian Foreign Minister demands the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is "nearly over".
In his UN speech, Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their home country.
However, there is no end to seven years of war.
More than 360 000 people have died in the war.
Federal Secretary Angela Merkel told on Friday in Germany that a Syrian meeting was scheduled for October, which would be accompanied by the French, Russian and Turkish Presidents.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans were looking at the Supreme Court's jury drama on TV.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh and professor Christine Blasay Ford, who charged him with harassment, received exceptionally many people in the squares.
In the United States, at least 20 million people were assigned to their televisions on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Professor Blasey Ford of California, who was in charge of harassment, were in front of the Senate's Justice Committee to tell his story.
According to the preliminary results, the consultations were followed on six main channels, ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, with a total of 20.4 million viewers.
Many millions more were followed by the online consultation.
NBC reported that there were 6.8 million people following live streams, and CNN reported that he had made his record of the year with the launch of a live broadcast of 8.2 million.
The CNN figure is rising over 10 million when it is calculated by means of YouTube and Facebook who are following the transmission.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million.
Digital start-ups are channels' own, TV viewers are derived from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but they are in any case dizzy.
Few people reach $20 million
In the United States, over 20 million audiences are usually only available for sports games and the great Oscar and Grammy galaxies of entertainment and occasional political events such as presidential talks and in 2016 also for presidential elections.
For the US's most viewed annual program, the NFL final game of the American football League, there is, of course, a trip to Super Bowl.
This year, Super Bowl collected about 103 million people along the squares to NBC.
Last year, the first talk of Trump to Congress, according to Nielsen, was seen by around 48 million people and 30 million people who were in office.
It's a very important issue.
The appointment of the Supreme Court is an extremely important case in the United States, as the offices are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalia died from the beginning of 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent the barbarian president Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced this year that he would retire.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican Vice President Ronald Reagan, but he was the so-called 'waisian' language in several respects, whose voice was able to resolve the position of the 9-spiritual court.
He was a supporter of abortion law and sexual minority rights and, for example, in 2015, resolved that the same sexes received marriage law throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than his canoe.
His choice to the highest court may lock the law for decades of Conservative Power.
Children have the right to gain information to parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 will see information on the health of their children on Kanta’s service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
At first, the situation in Kanta was, of course, even more worrying: the parents did not even have access to health information or recipes for young people.
The situation was provisionally characterised in autumn 2016 for persons under the age of 10 years.
Since then, it has been promised to correct the practices, but it has taken an amazing long time to fix.
Now the correction is promised - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the change of the legal basis should not have been more than a vocabulary.
After that, the intelligence of the painter is about pushing the button: when it is now closed, it will be opened.
Of course, the child can show his parents his information if he has banking licenses or a official ID card.
But how many ten-year-olds have?
The ID card is free of charge, and you can't even get a 10-year-old banking license.
So, in practice, no one can see the data of the fourth class at the primary school except by asking them to be printed.
It's not as much the right of parents as the right of children.
It is extremely important for the child’s care that parents may be involved in it.
The right to privacy of teenagers must, of course, be ensured.
Even minors may have family situations where not all matters can be freely spoken.
Often they are related to sexual health, free care of which is deeply relevant to human rights.
In the United States, the FBI started blaming the allegations against Kavanaugh.
According to US media, the FBI will investigate the charges of harassment by at least two women.
One of the women was previously consulted by the Senate's Justice Committee this week.
Kavanaugh has contested the alleged sexual harassment during his study.
President Donald Trump of the United States ordered the FBI to investigate charges at the request of the Senate's Justice Committee.
The investigation must not last a week longer.
According to Washington Post, it's a criminal investigation for a limited investigation, and it doesn't necessarily become public.
He threatened to kill cops at the police station in Kajaan.
The tied-up wrecker continued to squeeze in the chamber.
The police say he put a man in a police prison to "rule."
The police were threatened by the suspected assassin in the anti-Saturday night in Cajaan.
The official will inform you of a case that started when a fair 30-wave man hardly challenged a fight at the central restaurant.
First, he assaulted another client inside the food store.
This led to the removal of the restaurant.
A fighter outside attacked another man by pouring him to the ground.
When the third party tried to intervene, the man also hit him.
Triple offensive arrest led to a call to the police.
The patrol took the man and took Kajaan to the police station, the police told him.
The suspect was still aggressive at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the foot.
He threatened to kill and assault the cops.
The police say he's sent a man to the police prison to "rest."
The man is suspected of three assaults and the violent opposition of an official.
Assistance organisations are preparing to start working on the Indonesian Sulawes, "The fastest emergency is the clean water."
The UN Children's Organisation Unicef and other international assistance organisations are ready to help in Indonesian Sulawes Island, says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information of the Finnish Unicef.
Local authorities are in charge of rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already obvious at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal activities, Unicef always has full emergency response capacity, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people in ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
Please, in the town of Sulawes rescue measures are underway, but the situation in the Donggala region is slightly further northern.
There are still places where connections are not working.
Assistance measures are difficult because roads are also cut, says Haru.
Buildings are often light structured in the Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquake and tsunami is large.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection at first, for example, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
For the first time, most people are able to offer water cleaning tablets that UNICEF also has in stock.
Water systems are intended to be repaired as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported, for example, by trucks.
In crisis situations, many children will get rid of their parents.
Finding family members and joining families is one part of the Unicef field.
Food aid is once again organised by the World Food Programme (World Food Programme) as part of the UN.
In the initial phase, emergency aid will be used with the funds previously collected.
However, among other things, Unicef has already started collecting money to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
The billionaire Elon Musk will end the fines of $20 million on twittes as president of Tesla's government.
Elon Musk, founder of companies producing space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud by agreement with the US Securities Commission.
The billionaire Elon Musk will end his job as Chairman of Tesla's Board and agree to a fine of $20 million.
Musk is avoiding the task as part of the agreement that he concluded with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
By agreeing to Musk avoid fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission, SEC, threatened Musk because of the twittets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he is preparing for Tesla to be withdrawn from the stock exchange by the electric car company, which led to a rapid increase in the company's stock exchange rate.
According to the agreement, Musk must not be chaired by the Tesla Government for three years.
In addition, Teslan has to appoint a new "independent member" of his government and take two "independent leaders" into his board.
Teslan must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk is still allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal fines of $20 million, Tesla also has to pay 20 million equivalent fines to the financial supervisor.
Twits misleaded investors
According to the SEC, the Musk twitters misleaded investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk argued that he would have ensured the financing of Tesla to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange into a private stock company.
According to the billionaire's twitters, the company would have been bought from the stock exchange for $420.
Tesla’s stock exchange rate rose by more than 10 per cent a day after the twittets, but later declined.
According to the SEC, Musk’s claims had no basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated his claim for funding.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal of the stock exchange with any other management group or company government.
On Friday of this week, the course fell by 14 per cent when the securities supervisor, SEC, announced the charges of fraud.
It is expected that the new agreement will re-establish the company's course.
The last sentence is not a reason
Of course, the clocks of the judgment church do not ring when the wise do not move.
It's a technical error.
The clock of the Helsinki Tower of Judgment has stopped.
The wise will show you at 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a medieval horror film: even when the church crypta belongs to exorcism and the horrors themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it is broken.
It's been seen by a repairer, but some part is broken, and there's a new part waiting for it, so Suniity Evelina Jamsen tells us.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki -Twitter account.
In fact, the final judgment is not a reason for stopping the clock.
Jamsen tells me that church clocks don't sound because of the mistake.
