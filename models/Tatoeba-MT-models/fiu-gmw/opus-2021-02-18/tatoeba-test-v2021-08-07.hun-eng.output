I came by to see you today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I study about two hours every day.
I'm busy studying at school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you're packed and ready to go.
I must have heard that voice somewhere.
I swear I'll make up for this.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half miles a day.
Does your daughter feel better?
Are you doing a dangerous job?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There's no doubt about it.
That affects everyone.
It's not over until we're done.
I'll take his place.
I'm going to work on a train every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
It could be better with your sister.
This goes with the love I feel for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
The price of this is two euros.
It could be a problem.
It could be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all those jobs ruined.
He clearly freaked me out.
It's not broken.
I wasn't bad.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
The snow didn't stop.
It's cool to let you come.
You don't do anything!
No matter who started it and why.
It doesn't look that complicated anymore.
That doesn't look right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like it was poured on me.
I soon realized I misunderstood him.
It was snowing the day before.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
This happened at the beginning of the last week.
That's exactly what happened on the day of our marriage, honey.
There must have been a reason for this.
Suddenly it happened.
That's what happened when he was out there.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
He's got his own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think every fat man should die.
I think everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think some movie cubes fell out.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I can kill him.
I don't think I could kill.
I don't think I understand you.
I feel better.
I think I have the answer.
I think I'll buy it to Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It's like I saw a rat.
I think I have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's right.
It's a very small probability, I think you'll be able to do that by yourself.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think that's unfair.
I think it is.
I think it was Tom who helped Mari.
I think you better leave now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor may have died.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I think there's someone in the door.
I think something's not right.
I find spiders cute.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget this.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I think there's no point in trying to convince him.
I think you did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom's been there before.
I think Tomi's annoying.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tamás wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom will be able to help.
I think Tamás wins.
I think we can handle it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we've turned the wrong way somewhere.
I think we need to be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all cheered up now.
I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know the name of Tamas' girlfriend.
I think you're going to approve it.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.
I think you misunderstood it.
I think you should go in personally.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think your job is very good.
I think you smell nice.
I feel like you weren't persuasive enough.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we went out to eat, that would make us feel better.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought maybe it was worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was blowing up.
I've reconsidered my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it didn't prove it.
I thought Tomi was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened the neighbor to kill him.
That hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under its influence.
I was very impressed.
It's an accident!
It's a historical act.
It's hard to put it into practice that we were talking about.
It's hard for everyone to get in their minds.
It's hard to please everyone.
I have doubts about whether it's gonna work.
It's getting too late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's time for you to start a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
It's essentially your fault.
She's in the kitchen.
Wonderful!
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We have to prepare for the future.
You need some rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke signal cannot be turned off.
That's not the best way.
That's not the right solution.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It doesn't work.
Maybe he's lying.
It doesn't fit to talk full of mouth.
It's snowing.
He's still moving.
Wow, it's really bad today.
That's so expensive.
It's 30 meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him to do.
It's up to you.
That's useful information.
It's hot at night.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after you changed your baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It's gonna be dangerous.
It'll be dark till we get home.
It'll be ready as long as it takes.
He'll be ready until he needs it.
It'll take a while to wear the glasses.
He'll knock off soon.
It'll work if I exchange polarities.
Consequently, it looks bigger.
Looks good.
Looks like you don't need me here.
You could use a shaving.
Looks like you're not feeling very well here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
It could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This can save your life.
Maybe we'd love to try it.
Maybe I'll be late.
You have to wash it.
You have to report something.
Must have been love.
It must have been stolen.
You have to fix it.
He never existed.
It should never have happened.
I lied to him, even though I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomi not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you I was okay.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tomi.
I have a question, too.
I was bathing for a long time.
I've been in the tub for a long time.
I set it up.
I went on the 58th.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the animal hospital yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I totally forgot.
It'd probably be cheaper somewhere else.
Yesterday morning, the rain broke.
It fell yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I train two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I crossed the United States.
It actually works.
That's really sad.
I tried to keep her alive.
I was trying to forget.
I was trying to help Tom.
I'd trust my life.
I'll keep trying to figure it out.
I'm trying to get my mind together.
That's a nice flag.
Big cat.
It's a little early to drink, isn't it?
It's a boring word.
It's a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least on paper.
It's a grey stone building.
It's a housekeeping dog.
It's half an hour before lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's totally dark out there.
It's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
It's nice and good in theory, but will it work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's 7:00.
It's already in progress.
It's 10:00 a.m.
One of my dreams was always to live next to a stream.
It's always the same now.
It's a environmental disaster.
It's a lousy business, Watson, a lousy, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
That's too bad.
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
It's a pretty big cocktail.
It's a nightmare.
It's cold.
It's just as art as science.
It's the past.
She's at school.
It's a very dangerous sport, where a little mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a strange question.
This is terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
This day is exhausting.
It's a tough day.
That's what's happened before.
It wasn't just a week.
It's been two years since he left me.
That's better.
It's better to leap the garden at night.
It's hot.
It's in heaven.
Getting on the bus is cheaper.
That's Chinese for me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sundays.
Sunday's closed.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold at home.
It's cold.
It's cold out there.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
It's commonly known that bear likes honey.
It doesn't matter if Tom did it or not.
That's totally normal.
It's okay now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
That's delicious.
It's done!
It's easier not to start than stop.
It's easy to be brave from far away.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
Looks like the bus was late.
That sounds totally ridiculous.
Looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It looks very strange.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's not in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to work out for me.
Looks like you're being honest.
Looks like you're wrong to me.
Looks like we're having an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Dear.
It's fair to get the same salary for the same job.
He's not even perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, that's funny.
It's starting to freak out.
It's getting hot.
It's gonna be a tough time.
It won't be easy.
It's lucky to see a falling star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good to learn.
I'm glad you could make it.
I'm sure you're gonna laugh.
It's hard not to reach that conclusion.
It's hard to believe that all this time was clean and sunny.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bank in this town where you can sleep.
It's hard to put it in words.
It's hard to express in words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's kind of nice.
He's got a irrational head.
He's tall.
The kids are already in bed.
Stop talking about money.
It's warmer than usual tonight.
This is illegal.
It's important.
It is important that parents stand on the same side when child rearing takes place.
It's important that we help people in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your terms.
We don't know what tomorrow will bring.
Unbelievable, you know?
It's inevitable.
That's inspiring.
It's just a feeling.
Just move.
It's only a matter of time for Tom to get in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's pretty hard.
That's important enough.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
It's nice of you to say that.
It's late.
It's washing today.
It's like a submarine field, and the turtles, the sharks and the sharks above it are like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic how he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
That's my horse.
It's my life!
It's my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
Not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
He's not as vigilant as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
This is not going to happen.
It's not going to be Minnad's job to change Egypt.
This isn't mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not negotiable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you're doing, it's how you do it.
It's not worth sniffing about him.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't tell you.
I didn't tell you.
There's no point in confessing to the priest if you don't prove repentance.
It doesn't make sense to get bored in the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
It's definitely impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's not a problem if some people think I'm a farmer.
It's okay if you're gay.
“ It’s been three months, and Tomi’s already saying that he speaks French liquidly. ” — Well, it’s on the top of the stupid sheges. — What peak? — Dunning-Kruger-effectus.
It's only three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's like I'm pouring it out of jazz.
He opened his wings.
It's amazing.
It's very convincing.
It's quite simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these mizantropic theories is manifested in the estimation of the working class, exempting imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars that it has provoked and to believe the core of the idea that the aggressive tendency of endless wars has been born in humans.
It's urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
It's really a big deal.
It's right there.
It's no excuse to ask someone how much he's earning.
They say the Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they'll be leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston now.
It's so good to stay home.
He's still moving.
It's suicide.
It's technically possible.
It's the best book I've ever read.
That's the least I can do.
Theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
You still have to answer that.
It's time we took our tent tree.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to solve the problem.
I'm supposed to have to cut my hair off.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's time for us to do something about this.
Tom's birthday is today.
It's Tom's decision.
Tomi's word is against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
That's expensive to me.
It's too hot for this.
Too late for grief.
It's too late to worry about that.
Typical autumn time.
It sucks to get cold.
It's ugly, rotten yellow, and it's not harmonized, but at least they don't gase in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think he is.
There's no like anything serious going to happen.
Now it depends on them.
It's up to you to go there or not.
Very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
Very disturbing.
It's very entertaining.
It costs a lot to live here.
That's very kind of you.
This is very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed on.
It's your only chance.
For the thorough learning of a language, about 10,000 hours are needed.
You must be bold for success.
It took almost three years to build my house.
It took almost three years to build my house.
Everyone's been touched unexpectedly.
It took just an hour.
It took me a lot of time to write this book.
It took me more than a month to recover from the cold.
Tom took a long time to pick a pair of shoes.
It took me a long time, but I finally managed to find him.
I turned into a little alley.
I've been on the wire.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friend's competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was fun.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
It was a stupid idea.
That was a tragic accident.
It was really great food.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was awfully strange.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a wonderful night.
It was chaotic.
It was clearly very enjoyable.
We had fun last night.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and the time was tanning.
It was just a trip.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost dark.
John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
That wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It was not easy for me to keep my promise.
That was a lower blow on the belt.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who cut the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't intentional.
