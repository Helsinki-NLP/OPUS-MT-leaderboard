The members of the Wales Union are afraid to look stupid.
Some members of the delegation have been confused with the proposal that their title should be replaced by MWP, a Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The court began with the plan to change the name of the delegation into the Wales Parliament.
The members of the delegations are concerned, regardless of the party population, that they may be mocked by the change.
According to a representative of the Labour Party, the group is concerned that the name is "became with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
According to one representative of the Plain Party, the majority of the group "not satisfied" has proposed other options.
According to the representative of the Conservative Party, his group's approach to the change of name is "with open mind", but it notes that the word MWP is a short wording of the word for stupid.
In Wales, the W book is expressed in a similar manner as the Yorkshire U letter.
The Commission, which is currently preparing the legislative change needed to change its name, said: "The final decision on the designations of members of the delegation, of course, belongs to the Members itself."
The Law on Wales Administration of 2017 gives the representative the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion on proposals that the appointment of a delegation to the Wales Parliament would benefit from broad support.
The Commission favours Members of the Wales Parliament or shortened WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public opinion survey.
The members of the Representation Board are obviously proposing alternative titles, but the lack of consensus can lead to a major concern for President Elin Jones, who is expected to have a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also includes other changes in the functioning of the delegation, such as the rules on the loss of representation and the form of the committee system.
At the legislative procedure, members of the delegation may give their final voice on what title they should be called.
The Macedonians are going to the electoral city in a referendum on the change of the name of the country
On Sundays, the voters will vote on whether the name of the country will be changed to the 'Republic of Northern Macedonia'.
The referendum aims to resolve a decade-long conflict with Greece, a neighbouring country which has also its own Macedonian region.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of the northern neighbour is in practice a regional requirement for its region and has repeatedly opposed its membership efforts by the EU and NATO.
Mr Ivanov, President of Macedonia against the referendum, has said that he would ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is simply the price paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins' watches silence when the churches of Harlem live in difficult times
"Older people with whom I have been discussing, say that before every corner of the street was a bar or a church," says Adams.
"There's no one at the moment."
He said losing bars is understandable.
He said, "Well, we've changed our relationship with people."
"The bars are no longer common living rooms in the neighbourhood, to which people meet regularly."
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not take as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to the start-up box."
He added that churches can be replaced by houses and apartments that are not those that support the rest of the neighborhood.
"The most unquestionable people who buy apartments from these buildings will be white," he says, "and so they will speed up the day when these churches close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most people moving to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a residential area of black people - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
In the 1930s, the original White Methodist Church moved away.
Nearly the black congregation acquired the building.
St Martins took over the black congregation under the leadership of pastor John Howard Johnson, leading a boycott against the traders of the main Harlem store 125th Street.
The fire in 1939 damaged the building. When Father Johnson’s parishes planned to rebuild, they introduced the tower clock game.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martins, proudly called the tower clocks.
The expert who played the Tornicello game in July called it another name: "Cultural Aarts" and "uncompensated historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first tower ring play played by a black musician. It was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a bigger tower play at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
The last few months in St. Martins has developed a complex voyage involving architects and contractors hired by the church leaders and, on the other hand, by the episcopal sneakers.
In July, the governing body, composed of the congregation’s clergymen, wrote its free concerns to the sneakers that the sneaking would "sweep to the cost of the sack" even though he had not satisfied the hiking of architects and contractors sent by the skull.
Some in the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the matter of sneaking.
The shark hurt a 13-year-old lobster in California.
Officials say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and hurt him when he dives his lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he dived with his friends on Saturday morning about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and the group were going to see the boy to help this out of the water.
Hammel told me that he thought he was just excited to catch a lobster, but then he realized he was screaming, "I was bited!"
I got bit!
After getting to the boy, Hammel says he noticed that this whole solitary bone had been ripped open.
"I asked everyone to leave the water: there's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady’s children’s hospital in San Diego, where he is reported to be critical.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown.
The lifesaver Captain Larry Giles said at a media event that a shark had been detected in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim had severe injury to his upper arm.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casablad Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are considered to be harmless.
Sainsbury's intends to treat the United Kingdom's beauty nurse.
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in the art house-style beauty care departments in which expert advice is provided.
This is a major business for a beauty nurse worth 2.8 billion pounds of the United Kingdom, which continues to grow even though the sale of fashion and home products is deteriorating. Larger beauty care departments are being tested in 11 shops across the country, and they will be extended to other shops next year.
Beauty care products are placed because supermarkets are trying to fill the shelf space that was previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's tells us that its range of beauty treatment is doubled to 3 000 products, which for the first time include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelle and Burt's Bees also receive more space, and they get their own brands in their region like Boots stores.
The Supermarket also relaunches its Boutique make-up selection. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly because young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop is experimenting with rental shops in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened last week in Croydon in South London, and the other is opened to Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet purchases and the transfer of food purchases to small single purchases in close stores will force supermarkets to come up with new attractions for customers.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, said that shops will look more like shops when the supermarket chain struggles against low-cost stores like Aldi and Lidl by increasing services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores and also Habitat shops in its shops.
Supermarket failed in his previous attempt to renew its departments of beauty care and pharmacies.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the 21st century, but the cooperation ended with a doubt about how the profits of pharmacies located in supermarkets should be distributed.
A new strategy will be followed by a business trade where Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy business to Celesio, owned by the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, by 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds was part of a plan to extend the range of luxurious skin care products to four shops with signs such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial leader of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty departments to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in workers who have received special training who are willing to advise customers.
Our brand selection meets all needs and our attractive environments and our convenient locations make us a convincing place of beauty, which challenges the traditional way of making shopping."
Peter Jones's "great" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the 11 million-million-million agreement.
The Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, left "in his heart," when the TV promoter, Holly Willoughby, withdrawed from an agreement of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new agreements with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home-food and costume brand Truly.
The two companies have been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old competitor of the This Morning programme announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby pissed off Dragons Den by withdrawing Peter Jones from their profitable lifestyle business in the last few minutes. She intends to focus on her new gigantic agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources show that Jones was in the "green" last Tuesday's tensional meeting held at the capital office of the Jones Business empire in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV stargirl had admitted that his new $15 million contract would not leave enough time to Truly for their home supplies and housing.
The company has been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop product label and has been doubled to Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million pounds.
A 37-year-old Willoughby reported in Instagram that he left Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source, "Truly was obviously Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision of departure has left everything astonished.
No one could believe the events on Tuesday so close to the publication.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of products awaiting sale."
This Morning is one of the most promising stars in Britain, and his departure, according to experts, may cause a company a million losses due to product investments, including all pillows in candles and clothing for home supplies, not to mention the delay in publication.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close for ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby arranged Cappin Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, became president in March.
Couples resort together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby's new brand-general M&S is being boiled and replaced by Ant McPartlin's ITV I'm A Celebrity.
The source close to Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
And then we fell in love.
He was making a joke about the criticism that he would receive in the media of his comments, which some would consider inappropriate to the President, and his prosperity to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said pretending to sound "new tanker."
"I didn't give up at all."
He pointed out Kim's interest in reaffirming the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea's nuclear inseparation.
However, nuclear negotiation has been haunted.
More than three months after the Singapur Summit in July, North Korean High diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North Sea would not see a "resulting response" to early arms disarming operations in North Korea.
On the other hand, he said that the United States would continue its sanctions, with the aim of which to maintain pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view of his speech.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship."
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results. The missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been assisted in freedom and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when speaking about his relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get out of this full hall, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, showing the audience right ahead.
The Tsunami of Indonesia and the earthquake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead.
As a preamble to the post-manufacturing of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organisations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency situation needed for international assistance was not declared, although about 10% of Lombok’s inhabitants had left homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children form a traveling group, it is not sure whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, the National Defence Agency informant, said that the Indonesian authorities will assess the situation please to see if international organisations are allowed to participate in the assistance work.
Indonesia is still unfortunately unprepared to meet natural forces, taking into account frequent earthquakes.
Although tsunami protections have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The fire was likely lost because of the missing tsunami warning shield, even though the warning was valid.
Traveling between many islands in Indonesia is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship to help the victims of an earthquake in Lombok is on its way to return, but it takes at least three days before reaching a new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo made the focus of his electoral campaign on the development of the infrastructure in Indonesia, and he has spent money on improving roads and railways.
However, some administrations have been affected by a financial shortage, while new elections are approaching next year.
The pressures of one are also increased by the tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the country’s Muslim majority have adopted the older form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with jungle knives, bows and arrows, and other sublingual weapons. This has led to the death of more than 1,000 people, and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes.

The number of deaths of the Tsunami of Indonesia is rising to 832 dead
The Indonesian disaster agency reported early on Sunday the number of earthquakes and tsunami deaths to 832 victims.
At a press conference, the informant of the Agency, Sutopo Purwo, said that many had been trapped in the ruins of the collapsed buildings when 7.5 magnified earthquakes hit on Friday and raised waves of up to six metres.
The fragments of the ruined buildings spread widely to 380 000 inhabitants, please visit the city.

The Cromwell patsask of Parliament became part of the rewriting of history
It would be poetic right to reject the statue, given that his own fanatical puritanists destroyed the cultural and religious monuments of England as well as the best Talibans.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal for "typeryde" and "rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would make a target of Oliver Cromwell's statue outside the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell didn't order or implement the British Civil Wars Icon Icon Collama.
The wrong Cromwell might suffer from the works of his ancestor Thomas who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent description of Cromwell shows the views of the 18th century and is a historical evidence of a character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, although perhaps more in the 18th century than today, see Cromwell as a defendant of Parliament against the external pressure, which, of course, was caused by the monarchs in this case.
Is this a precise description of the subject, then, the subject of continuous historical debate.
At least it is certain that the conflict in the mid-1900s has shaped the future development of our nation. Cromwell, on the other hand, must be identified by a character representing the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievement as a state administrator deserves praise and memory."
Killer pig snatched by a Chinese farmer's death
Local media tell the pig to attack the farmer and kill it at the market in Southwest China.
Only the body of the man named "Yuan" was found in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou. The man’s artery had been broken and he was in the blood, the South China Morning Post news on Sunday.
The chicken is preparing to vaccinate pigs in pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province of China.
He and his cousin traveled from the nearby Yunna county on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed that the door of a close pig was open.
In the Sikala, he said he saw a big cattle with his mouth in the blood.
According to the news, the criminal investigation confirmed a cattle of 250 pounds from the deaths of a farmer with a raven.
The Guiyang Evening News tells me a cousin named "Wu" said "my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised."
The surveillance camera looks like the cousin arrives at the market to feed the pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the heads of the market told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that it would not harm other police evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and thetorian authorities are reported to negotiate compensation for the death case.
It is known that pigs have attacked people before, even though it is rare.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 pounds threw a Walesian farmer against this tractor until his wife managed to get the animal out of her way.
After the event in Manitoba, a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, told CBC News that even though the pigs are generally not aggressive, the taste of blood can work as a "slayer".
"They're just playing games.
They're like little kids, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt you.
All we have to do is respect them properly," he said.
The remains of the Hurricane Rose bring large rains to the Southwest of the United States
The Hurricane Rosa is predicted to deteriorate as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, Rosa will bring floods to North Mexico and to the Southwest of the United States.
The wind rate of the Rose was 38 metres per second, i.e. the hurricane of the first class, on Sundays at 5:00 p.m., and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure on the sea is forming, heading east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives on Monday in California as a tropical storm, it begins to pour deep tropical humidity north to the southern parts of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 250 millimetres of rain into some parts of Mexico.
After that, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching low pressure will form large rain areas in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, the amount of rain between 25 and 100 millimetres cause dangerous floods of rain and possibly landings in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes 50-75 millimeter rain per hour in certain landing areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
For certain areas in the lunch, and in particular Arizona, it is expected to be up to 50-100 mm rain.
Strong crops are possible and conditions can quickly deteriorate due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In the threat of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid leaving the desert.
Strong rains can transform canyons into rivers that flow from the mountains, and storms cause local wind bubbles and flying dusts.
Nearly low pressure will bring local rain on the coast of Southern California.
More than 10 millimetres of rain are possible, causing small waste streams and slipping roads.
This would be the first rain of the rainy season in the region.
The scattered tropical raincoats begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday until the rain expands during Monday and Tuesday.
The harsh rain spreads to Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts the whole Wednesday.
In October, in the United States, powerful flushings can be seen at temperatures when the Arctic region cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes high temperature flushings in short distances.
In the middle of the United States, there is an excellent example of large temperature differences on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omahan and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowan Des Moines.
The temperature of the summer is re-enhancing and expanding in the next few days.
The start of October is widely expected to be warm in the middle and east of the United States, while temperature is close to +26 degrees from the southern planes to the north.
In New York, the temperature can hurt to +26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term forecast is that in the eastern parts of the United States, there are good opportunities for higher temperatures than average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
On Tuesday, over 20 million people watched a broadcast from six television channels, where Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasay Ford, who blamed him for sexual offense in the 1980s, gave their fascinating witness statements.
At the same time, the political situation of the patrol continued as the television companies stopped their broadcasting at the last moment, following which the FBI conducts a weekly investigation of the charges on the basis of a contract organised by Senator Arizona, Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate's Judicial Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was struggling with him and tried to take off his clothes in high schools.
On the other hand, Kavanaugh gave a emotional witness statement saying that he was 100% sure that this was not the case.
There were probably more audiences than the 20.4 million reported on Friday by Nielsen.
The company decreased the average CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The figures of other channels sent by the opportunity, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen has often difficulty measuring viewers in offices.
Something about the dimensions tells us that the reading corresponds to the number of American football shooters or Oscar gala viewers.
According to Nielsen, the largest audience of all television companies was Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh. The channel had an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's consultation.
ABC's second was 3,26 million in his viewer.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC had 89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
After hearing, the interests were still high.
On Friday, in the center of the drama, there was Flake.
The CNN and CBS cameras described how the protesters' screams led him to the elevator on the way to the hearing of the Judicial Committee on Friday.
CNN looked straight, how he stood down for a minute and watched down when the rings were flying.
"She's right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you believe he'll tell the people the truth?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told."
Mr Flake said that his office gave an opinion and added that before the closure of the elevators, he had more information after consulting the committee.
Hours later, the cable and public transmission networks sent directly when the Committee on Justice began to vote on the introduction of Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary session.
However, Flake said that it was only in understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, as the minority Democrats have called for.
Flake was convinced partly with his friend, D.C. Chris Coons, on the basis of his discussions.
Flake made its decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
The choice of Flake was powered because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuseses critics of the Brext Politicization
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May blames the critics of his EU differential plans for politics, which threatens the future and national interest of Britain.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham in Britain on 29 September 2018.
On the front page of May's interview, another interview was launched, where his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls on the proposal for British and EU import duties on each other, "to be absurd".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a person suspected in the LSU of the shooting of a 20-year-old Wayde Sims dead.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department, he's being charged with a second-grade murder.
The authorities published a video of Sims and Simpson's interrogation, where the police told us that Sims lost his glasses.
The police found the glasses at the scene and told me they found Simpson's DNA, says WAFB.
The police say Simpson admitted Wayes shooting at interrogations.
According to Advocate magazine, his guarantee was set at $350.000.
A death investigation in the municipality of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The Agency thanks the State Police Force of Louisiana, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the region for assisting the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, Director of LSU's Sports, thanked the law enforcement authorities for their "newness and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father played basketball LSU.
He wrote on average 5,6 points and 2.6 play balls in the last season.
The LSU basketball coach, Will Wade, said Friday morning he was "seasy" and "seasy" about Wayde's death.
"You always fear something like this," Wayde said.
The volcano spits ash on Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetll Fire Mountain has reached the southern residential areas of the capital of Mexiko.
On Saturday, the Mexican Anti-Destruction Centre called on the citizens to stay away from the volcano when the crater was accelerated and 183 gas and ash discharges were registered during the day.
The center registers the grains and trills several times.
In the social media, pictures were published in car wind glasses covered in a thin ash layer in areas like Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geographicalists have observed an increase in the activity of a volcano located 72 km from the capital to the southwest since Mexico was shaken by 7.1 Magnified earthquakes in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and the Catalan Separatists agree before the anniversary of the autonomy vote
On Saturday, in Barcelona, six persons were arrested in a clash of independent protesters and a rival police officer. Thousands participated in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the separation of opinions.
The police arrested a group of masked self-esteemists who threw the police with eggs and powder paint, who formed dark dust clouds on streets normally filled with tourists.
In the day, more shrimps broke out when the police used their patrols to control the snacks.
Conciliations between the autonomy supporters and the groups of the Unionists continued for several hours, while the previous was screaming "no forgetting, no forgiveness" and the latter 'Let Spain live'.
The local press reports that 14 people were treated for minor injuries in demonstrations.
The tension is still on the surface of an autonomy area one year after the referendum of 1 October, declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by the Catholic Separatists.
The voters complained about independence with a clear majority, although the vote was low in opposition to the boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to prevent voting at voting stations across the region.
Independence groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent a national police protest.
However, a remark was arranged, but it had to pass another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the demonstration of separatists with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful of the autonomy of Catalonia.
Last year, we had one of the best moments of our life.
This is how my parents crying for the joy of being able to vote, but now we are stuck in place," he says.
Despite the triumph that has been achieved in the last December district elections, despite the vital victory, the speed of the parties in favour of the autonomy of Catalonia has fallen this year. Many of the most well-known leaders are in volunteer exile or arrested waiting for a trial on their involvement in the organisation of a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who pictured a police protest on his phone, says on both sides of the politicians to argue with the letson.
"Your house gets blackmailed all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalonian leaders in the investigation prison until the last nine years, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"To become a candidate for Europe is the best way to condemn the deterioration and repression of democratic values, which we have seen by the Spanish Government," he says.
Londonderry: Men were arrested after the car hit the house
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car was reported to hit repeatedly on the house in Londonderry.
The events proceeded at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 7:30 in Britain.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
They may have been shot at some point in front of the car.
Livingston won Rangers 1-0 Menga with paint
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston ensured victory
The serial renegade Livingston exasperated the Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard another defeat in 18 fights as manager of the Ibrox Society.
Dolly Menga's goal was finally enough to win when Gary Holt's team got up to another place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew was left without the first host win of the season in Premiership. Next Sunday it will meet with director Hearts, which is eight points above.
The Rangers are facing another Rapid in the European League of Vienna on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his lossless pipe in the series for six fights, and coach Holt has not lost once he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places against a visitor suffering from a blade deficiency.
The Holt team should have led a long time before the goal, after causing the Rangers evil problems in their profoundness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finishing went wide, and next, Alan Lithgow slipped on the landline into Craig Halkett's blouse supply, but he was running the ball past.
The fathers favorably handed the ball control over to Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate on special situations.
This is the way the important goal came.
Rangers caused Livingston a free trap from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played a place for Menga, from which he managed to move the ball to the center of the penalty zone and finish it.
By then, Rangers had held the ball, but said that the home team was defending, and the target guard Liam Kelly had not been able to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's company, and Lithgow led the ball past another special situation in Livingston.
The concentrations in the Livingston Penal Area were constantly cleaned out, and two situations required a misconduct - a Halketti tacked exchanger Glenn Middleton and a hand hit ball.
"Great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni
It's a wonderful performance and a result from Livingston.
The team continued to cross the expectations and was excellent at every player, continuing through the rising leads.
The team's gambling and crew has not changed much since it has risen back to the highest serial level.However, it must be acknowledged for the way in which he has strengthened the team when he arrives.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great in leading an excellently organized defense, Mengan holding Connor Goldson and Joe Workal on their toes the whole fight.
But Rangers didn't have any ideas.
At times, the team has been very well under Gerrard, but now it has remained far from his level of demand.
The last pass was exhausted, and they managed to open the home team defense only once. This should be a wake for the Rangers, which is the center of the table.
Erdogan received a variable reception in Cologne
The smile was sensitive and the sky on the blue Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve NATO alliance.
There have been differences between human rights and freedom of the press and Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Köln to open a giant new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented the 25 000 people from meeting before the mosque, justifying the issue for security reasons, but still gathered a lot of supporters to look at the President.
The protesters - many of which were Kurdishes - who were against Sada Erdogan also brought to the people of their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to invite him to the country.
Controversial demonstrations reflect the division of opinions, and some Turkish Germans greet him as a hero when he is ridiculed by others.
Road accident in Deptford: The bike will die in a crash with the car
The bike guy died when he hit the car in London.
The accident occurred from about 10 a.m. in the southwest of Deptford, near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street with a busy traffic.
The car driver stopped and the medical staff came to help the victim, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another bikeman died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about a mile away from a Saturday accident.
The city police say they're trying to identify the man and inform his loved ones.
There are road closures and bus traffic has been redirected, and cars have been called to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in trouble
Prisoners report the high security classification of men injured by six prisoner guards in prison troubles.
At the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire, about 09:30 p.m., the UK time started and continues on Sunday.
Tornado special police officers have been brought to the station to calm the disturbations behind which eight prisoners are in a single prison wing.
The police's minor face injury was treated at the scene.
One informant said: "HMP Long Lartin prison has been sent to a specialised prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible are taken into account by the police and may have to spend longer behind the clerks."
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lart's prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the Prisoner reported that he was hospitalized after one of the prisoners had attacked him.
In addition, in October the prison was alerted to riot cops due to serious turbulences in which they attacked the staff with pool balls.
The Hurricane Rosa brings the threat of harsh rainwaters to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas can benefit)
There are rarely tropical low pressures in Arizona, but that is exactly what happens at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rose pass over the southern desert, bringing the risk of heavy raining.
The National Weather Service has already given a warning of heavy rainfall on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, south-east Caufornia and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrives on Monday in the form of rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service pointed out in its twitter that "only ten tropical storms have kept the state of a tropical storm or low pressure at a distance of 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was still a hurricane at a distance of 65 km from the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the national hurricane centre are predicting the rain of 50-100-millimeters. On the Mogollin field in Arizona, it can rain up to 150 millimetres.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central rock mountains and Great Basin, there are a total amount of 25 to 50 milliliter. At some points, it can be 100 millimetres.
Rose’s rains can also be a blessing to the drought in the area if there is no risk of heavy crops.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains may be useful, because severe drought has been suffered in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Agency, over 40% of Arizona suffers at least from extreme drought, which is the second highest, saysweather.com.
Rosa, the Hurricane, first makes her way to land in the California peninsula of Mexico.
On Sunday morning, the location of Rosa is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. At that time, the hurricane’s wind rate is still strong at 135 km/h. It moves north to 20 km/h.
The storm loses its power when faced with cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico with a strong tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico rains can be severe and pose a significant flood risk.
"From the suburban of California, the northwestern Sonora is expected to be 75-150 millimetres, and up to 250 millimetres are possible," saysweather.com.
Rosa then continues to travel through Mexico as a tropical storm before it arrives at the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure on Tuesday morning hours. It continues to travel through Arizona to the southern Utah on Tuesdays by late.
"The biggest risks of Rosa or its remains are very severe in the California peninsula, northwestern Sonora and the Southwest of the United States," says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening floods and waste streams in deserts, as well as landings in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests on attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning in the UK.
He was taken to a hospital where he's reported to be in a "stable" state.
The police say they arrested one of the 17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking for contact with anyone who may have video footage recorded on a mobile phone on events.
Trump says Kavanaugh's experienced democratic party "goodness and anger"
"My judge Kavanaugh is the vote against the ruthless and shameful methods of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was suffering from the "goodness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, He strongly denounced Christine Blasay Ford's accusation of sexual harassment that would have occurred decades ago during their teenage years.
Ford also proved his accusations in the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said, "Americans saw Kavanaugh's exquisite, natural and boldness" that day.
"My mother, Judge Kavanaugh's appointment, is a vote for one of the most honored judiciary students of our time, who has excellent seasites for public service," she told West Virginia's supporters.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s appointment when speaking about the importance of the Republican voting activity in the median elections.
"We're five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
Not just a campaign, but a whole campaign," he said.
"That's why I'm going anywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats took the task of "responding and preventing".
The senior advisor of the Republican party leadership told CNN that the first important vote on Kavanaugh's appointment procedure will be expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday.
Hundreds of dead in the earthquake and tsunami of Indonesia, the number of deaths is expected to rise
On Saturday, the authorities reported at least 384 dead major earthquakes and tsunami attacked the island of Sulawes in Indonesia. Many were wiped out with giant waves that hit the beaches.
There were hundreds of people gathered on Friday at the city’s beach festival when waves of up to six metres high hit the beach at night. Many chopped their deaths in the destruction of waves all the way.
Tsunam was caused by 7.5 magnituded earthquakes.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, the people were still on the beach, and they did not escape immediately when they remained victims of it," says the Indonesian Bureau for the relief of major accidents at Purwo Nugroho Jakarta, BNPB.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, but it pulled cars, wooden hulls, houses and hits all over the country," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached 800 kilometres per hour before he hit the coast.
Some of the people survived the tsunami alive by climbing into the trees, he tells.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The air images published by the disaster agency show a number of destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounding the water.
On Saturday, the coastal town was still shaken by the after-sessions.
The earthquakes seemed to be in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian technology assessment and application agency BPPT issued an opinion that the energy released in the grand earthquake of Friday was equivalent to some 200 atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
It says that the city’s landscape at the end of a long and cape bay may have stirred the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as a "extension" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He reported that some of the victims’ bodies were found in the ruins of broken buildings and added that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death victims and that the damage may be more than 300 kilometres north of the continuous coast, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communications "are completely broken, and no information has been obtained from Donggala" says Nugroho.
According to the opinion of the Red Cross, more than 300 000 people live there, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the region.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticised about not saying that the tsunami had hit the return, but the authorities said that the waves had arrived during the warning.
In a socially distributed amateur video, the man upstairs in the building exhibits intense warnings to people on the streets of the approaching tsunami.
Only minutes later, a water wall hits the beach, which takes buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately verify the authenticity of the image material.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a wide fall in electricity, which cut off communications from around Please, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue measures.
Authorities tell us that the army has started sending help from Jakarta and other cities with transporting machines, but evacuated ones still need hard food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has only been reopened for aid measures and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was supposed to visit evacuation centres Please visit the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The indonesian tsunami victim count exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision's Donggala staff has reached safety in the town of Please, where they are located in the tent of the office's indoors. On their way, they passed the scene of destruction, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses," he says.
It's really bad.
At the start of the help groups, some complained that foreign aid workers would be prevented from travelling to return.
According to Indonesia's provisions, funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to flow until the accident area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"There is still a state disaster in this area," says Aulia Arriani, the mediator of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"When the government says "OK, this is a national disaster", we can begin to receive international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made."
When the second night landed, please, after a Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family members who were missing had the hope that by the miracle of their loved ones, they would differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was lifted out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian dependent team, had trained two missing addicts for Asian races previously ended this month.
In the Roa Roa hotel, his students were also trapped, says Mandagi.
"As a senior member of dependence, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon says that he desperately tried to reach those who participated in the beach festival, please, competitors with whatsApp visits after the news of the invasion of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the addictive community.
However, only one grey sign appeared after the messages he sent, instead of two blues.
"That means, I understand, that messages weren't received when they were delivered," he says.
The thieves took $26.750 in connection with the addition of the bank machine in Newport on the Levea.
The thieves took 26,750 dollars from the Brink's security company on Friday morning when this was in addition to the banking machine in Newport the Leve.
The car driver had been evacuating and supplementing the banking machine at the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy reports in the newsletter.
When Brink's employee's attention was elsewhere, "behind he ran a man," who stole a money bag for delivery.
According to the news, several witnesses saw a number of people fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
Persons with information about their identity are asked to contact Newport police at 959-292-33680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name Ye
Robber Kanye West is changing his name Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The guy who used to be known as Kanye West."
Ye has been a 41-year-old West's nickname for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album published in June.
The change precedes his future presence in the Saturday Night Live programme, where he is expected to publish his new album named Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the author of the program, canceled his participation for "sensitive reasons".
West has previously said that the word also has a religious significance to him, not only is it a shortening of his professional name.
When I was discussing the name of the album earlier this year with the radio distributor Big Boy, West said, "I believe that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "you".
"So I'm you, us, and all of us.
It began with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in a shorter form, Ye, who just manifests the goodness, evil, confusing, everything in us.
"The Album is mostly thinking about who we are."
He's one of many known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known varyingly with the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that they prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former partner, JAY-Z, has also removed and returned the link and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO's permission not to use an army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico, promised that no military force would ever be used against civilians.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza, promised not to use an army for the oppression of the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, armed forces fired a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were rooting in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young people in Mexico by providing monthly study support and opening up more free public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and training opportunities would lead young people to criminal gangs.
United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
The United States should double the funding used for researching artificial intelligence when China intensifies its activities. This is how it says with Google, Microsoft and Apple the fundor and artificial intelligence professional Kai-Fu Lee.
The opinion was preceded by communications on the artificial intelligence of the various parts of the US administration, although there is no formal artificial intelligence strategy for the United States.
In the meantime, China has already presented its plan last year: it will seek to be a leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Duplication of the research budget would be a good start, considering that other countries are so much behind the United States and that we are looking for the next breakthrough of artificial intelligence," says Lee.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next significant artificial intelligence would be done in the United States, Lee reported this week in the CNBC interview.
Lee's book "Main Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He works as CEO in Sinonovation Venture, who has invested in one of China's most important artificial intelligence company called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which defeated the United States' highest convicted Othello player. Later he was the leader of Microsoft Research and the leader of Google's Chinese activities.
Lee acknowledged the previous technology competitions of the US administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next would be arranged to identify future visionists.
Lee says that American scientists worked hard to get public aid.
"Akademic influencers aren't taken by China, but by big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited university tops in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that the changes in immigration policy could help the United States to intensify their artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think that doctors who have a doctoral intellect should be automatically awarded green cards," he said.
China State Council of the next generation of artificial intelligence development plans in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other state organisations grant money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is weaker, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the Department of Defense Joint Artificial Intelligence Center was established by the Ministry of Defense, which aims to bring together industrial and academic partners in the world, and the White House has also announced the establishment of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month of a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
In turn, NSF invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative for the establishment of the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonians in a referendum amending the name of the country
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of the country to the 'Republic of Northern Macedonia', which would solve a decades-long conflict with Greece which has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, the province of Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour is practically a regional requirement for its region and has therefore opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries concluded an agreement on a new nomination proposal, but national opponents believe that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Slavian majority in Macedonia.
President Ivanov has announced that it is not going to vote in a referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts about whether the voting activity reaches the required 50% limit in order to obtain legal results.
The question on the vote flag was: "Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece"?
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, who supports the change of name, believes that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia, can seek to become a member of the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they respect the result of the vote in order to have a decisive effect.
Change in name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Electoral Board, no irregularities were reported by 13 noon.
However, voting activity was only 16, compared to 34 per cent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, which finally resulted in 66 per cent of the voting rights.
"I came here to vote for my children and to place in Europe," said the 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted for the capital in Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum on the name change of Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and sets chairs for the tents set up by the boycottians, before the Skopje Parliament.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads on top, not through the kitchen door, said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to another place, such as China and Russia as part of the integration of the euro area".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring well-equipped investments in Macedonia with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that a large majority votes in favour of a change in the name because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," said Zaev after having made their vote.
He said "yes" is our future.
The opinion survey published on Monday by the Institute of Political Research in Macedonia referred to the voting activity of 30-43% in the referendum, i.e. below the required activity.
In a second survey carried out by Tlma TV in Macedonia, 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said that they would vote for the yes option.
In order to succeed in the referendum, voting activity must exceed 50% by one voice.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious backfire for the Western Government after it came to power in May of last year.
See: Manchester City Sergio Aguero wins the entire Brighton Defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear sign of Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In 65 minutes, Aguero made his goal look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the pattern, the Argentinian top player received a feed from the middle field.
He found an empty space in the field by crawling through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He missed one defender and then left a number of others behind on the edge of the Brighton penal.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used his first touch within the penal area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton Guard Mathew Ryan goal with a shot in the right corner.
The city manager, Pep Guardiola, told the reporters, "Aguero has problems with his legs."
"We were talking about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he made a paint in that time."
However, Sterling had already given the sky’s blue advantage in the eleolithic struggle.
The painting came with 29 game minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in the area of Brighton.
He gave Leroy Sane a beautiful doorshoot on the left side.
Sane touched a few touches before he sent the ball back to Sterling.
The Heavenly Blue Attacker stabbed the ball into the net just before the end line.
City will meet at Hoffenheim's league stage on Tuesday at 12:55 in Rhein-Neckar-Arenala in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a cheerleader in a fight against Rockies.
Nationals is out of the drop-playing fight, so why try to start up with a lot of people?
However, at all times one competition spirit Scherzer hopes that he will take the shot shot in a Sunday fight against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a drop-off match, they have one win-win difference in the western series of Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies caught at least a wild card with 5-2 wins from Nationals on Friday night, but they're still aiming at their first division victory.
"While we don't have a bet, at least we can get up on the board, knowing that the atmosphere of the public and the second team breaking here in Denver creates the most demanding competition for me in the performance that I have encountered this year.
Why would I not want to accept the challenge?"
Nationals has not yet published their starter on Sunday, but according to the information, they are tended to give Scherzer an opportunity under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw the practice on Thursday, and he would play at the start of his 34 fights and feed him on Sunday on his normal rest shift.
Washington's right-hand player has a 18-7 profit/loss ratio this period. ERA statistics are 2.53 and he has burned the hitter 300 times in his nest, with a shift of 220 2/3.
Trump Campaign in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of his supreme judge Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of the Republican voting activity in the median elections.
"All our achievements are in the game in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the greatest -- not just a campaign, but a campaign full, and that's why I'm going everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You will see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you will see it happening right now.
They have decided to return to the misery of power by whatever means, and you can see their nastyness and evil favors.
They do not choose who are injurious or who must be crushed in order to gain power. That is what they want, power and power, but we will not give it to them.”
He said that the Democrats took the task of "responding and stopping".
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "hey and evil and evil and evil and false."
When he referred to Diane Feinstein, the last democratic senator in the Senate Judicial Committee, the public responded with loud buoys.
"Do you remember his answer?
Are you bleeding a document?
Uh, uh, what.
Well, uh, no, I'm just waiting for a little bit... it was really bad body language... from the worst body language I've ever seen."
The labour is no longer a tolerant congregation.
It doesn't tolerate those who say their opinions.
I'm not really surprised when the Momentum activists of my local party supported the motion of mistrust against me.
At least I'm just the last representative of Labour, who's told that I'm not welcome just because we're saying our opinions.
The only reason that my parliamentary group, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way was because he strongly opposed antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of credibility was a criticism of the fact that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The topics related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, Irony-like topics, which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
Nottingham East's Labour meeting said on Friday that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I have been representing the local Labour, the Friday sizes of the Council have been exactly the same.
Now many meetings do not follow that voice, and "friendlyer and more gentle" policy has long been forgotten if it ever started.
It is even more clear that the Labour Party will no longer tolerate differences in opinions and that each opinion will be assessed on the basis of whether it is suitable for a party party party or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and the colleagues with whom I had thought to share a similar political view began to expect me to have a full translation and statements that I would otherwise never have accepted, whether it was national security or the internal market of the EU.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there's an insult in the social media that calls for the cancellation of my choice, the rejection of central politics, and I can hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my own experience.
I do know that I am happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments on me are of a political nature at least.
I greatly respect the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual and racist insults every day and never fail.
Normalisation is one of the most disturbing aspects of the policy of this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corby required the Labour Party to adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with every motion of distrust or change of choice, the party will become more limited.
For two years, I have been urged to keep a low profile and to abstain from expressing my thoughts so that everything would go well.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the failures to the Single School of the Board of Thatcher, I have been trying to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I've never covered my political line, not even in the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East district has been surprised by my views or disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that when the state progresses towards the Brexit that hampers households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy to question my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my true message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I represent you with honor, and the threat of dissolution or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Invincible Ayr barrels
The two last few moments slightly distorted the end of the game, but Ayr no doubt deserved to win the day's entertaining Tennt's Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team of ten who has not lost any fights.
A great defence and more successful risk taking was ultimately what supported them, and Coach Peter Murchie can be pleased for a reason.
"We've been challenged in our fights and we're still invincible, so I can be happy." He says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, "All glory to Ayri, they took risks better than we do."
Ayr took the lead 14 minutes after Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climon's successful conversion strike, but the Scottish captain Roy Hughes, who gave the Warriors match, made it possible for Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot made the goal.
Climo raised Ayri's leadership in the land of punishment, and just before half-time, he made a goal and succeeded in the conversion trap, raising Ayr's leadership readings 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, whose conversion trap Baggot succeeded, declining the difference to five points.
There was a long delay in the game when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and pulled out of the field. As Ayr continued, Ayr raised his lead with the goal of Stafford McDowall, whose conversion strike Climo succeeded.
Ayri's captain Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, after which Melrosen Bruce Colvine made a hard-distance paint whose conversion hit failed.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card from stabbing the ballless Climo, and Macpherson made the goal of the Ayri’s Maul leaving the side limit.
Climo succeeded in the conversion trap in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's fire and winged Gregor Henry to finish the fifth goal of the home team.
The Star of Still Game begins in the restaurant industry
The star Ford Kieran of the Still Game series has been designated as the director of the licensed restaurant company and is likely to start working in the restaurant sector as well.
A 56-year-old actress presents Jack Jarvis's recommendation in the BBC program he's handwritten with his comedy partner Greg Hemhill.
The twin has announced that the coming nineth season is the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he has been identified as the manager of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the source of the Scottish Sun magazine indicated that Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow’s thriving restaurant business.
"The sea belongs to us": the inland Bolivia is trying to get back to the Pacific Ocean on the right route
Seamen patrol outside the Navy base in La Paz.
In public building flags, the sea blue flag is floating.
Ship bases Titicalta Amazon has been pushed by the slogan: "The sea is rightly ours.
It's our duty to get it back."
There is still a strong shoreline that has been lost to Chile in Bolivia in the bloody 19th century — as it also seeks to sail in the Pacific Ocean once again.
Hope is at the highest for decades when Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has a strong progression, a common spirit and indigestion, and, of course, a positive attitude in waiting for the final solution," said the bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzad.
A number of bolivians around the country will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens in the hope that, after a decades-long discussion, Bolivia’s view is that Chile is obliged to grant autonomous access to the sea.
The Bolivian charismatic president, Evo Morales, who faces the re-election of the contested battle next year, will play a lot in the direction of next Monday.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he convinced the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is likely not to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it were to decide, the situation would not change much.
The Dutch institution of the United Nations does not have the power to transfer Chile's administrative areas, and the ICJ has also announced that it will not determine the end of any negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the ICJ will only be taken six months after the final observations indicates that the case is not complex, says Paz Zarate, a Chinese expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have rather slowed down than promoted Bolivia’s purpose.
"The government of Bolivia has abducted the question of maritime connectivity," said Zarte.
Morales' challenged rhetoric has suppressed the rest of the Chileans' goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions at some point at some point, but then negotiations will be very difficult.
There has been no second embassy in either country since 1962.
The former President and Bolivia's representative in Haag, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, do not accept the view that the court's decision would have been exceptionally fast.
Monday gives Bolivia the "experienced opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreements in mutual benefit," he said.
Mr Calzad also argues that Mr Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea has announced that nuclear isolation will not happen unless it can rely on the United States.
North Korea will not give up their nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, said Ri Yong Ho, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Mr Ri's statement came just before the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is reopening with the nuclear weapons of dead end diplomacy, only three months after the United States met in Kim Jong Unin Singapore.
Ri said that there was a far-reaching dream to believe that the continued sanctions and the United States' opposition to the Korean Declaration of End of the War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pjongjang has first taken important measures to promote the dismantling of weapons, Washington is careful to accept the declaration.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump of the United States want a new summit.
However, the view that Pjongjang would be about to abandon the arms arsenal, which the State is likely to see as the only real way to guarantee its own security, has gained extensive doubts.
Pompeo is about to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare the next Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion performances present the most recent model of major headheads, which are about to be in your nearest street.
If you want to increase your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you do not need to continue looking for.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 model performance a selection of special over-sized headheads that would shine the style circles of the Paris fashion Weeks.
Very unpractical heads took Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino’s most beautiful creation was a beige hat with a wide feather clip covering almost all the heads of the models.
Other overgrown housings include water melon decorated with jewelry, sorcerered and even ananas — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of unique masks – just before Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the top fashion.
One creature with snorkel and mask was more like a diving device, and the other resembled a fuse of ice cream.
And if you want to take a stand for a large-scale fashion, you're lucky.
The fashion followers predict that huge shields will appear on the street.
The overgrown hats follow strictly "La Bomba", a half-metre-learned hat that has been seen from Rihana to Emily Ratajkowski.
In the social media, the unpractical cult landing of a largely visible cult also winged a second large creature into fashion displays — a shore bag made of the belly, which is almost as large as the model bearing it.
The raffle strap with burned orange garlic decorated with white leather gloves was the most visible creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 model in Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I have seen large-scale hats and beach bags on the street next summer – the designers have made such a great impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale housing."
John Edward: Language skills are the key skills for the world’s people
The study results of private schools in Scotland have been traditionally good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. Success has been improved by individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
These schools representing more than 30 000 schools across Scotland, representing the Scottish private schools SCIS, aim to provide a high level of service for their students and for the parents of the students.
Private schools are trying to prepare their students for their chosen career, for further and higher education and for world citizenship.
As an entrepreneur in the education sector, which can design and implement tailor-made study content, we have noticed the status of languages as a popular and hopeful student in continuing educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, the message goes into his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to create relations with people from other countries.
From the latest test results of this year, we find that the languages are at the top of the lists as regards the percentage of cross-accession between private schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest grade A.
The material was collected from 74 SCIS schools. On the basis of the material, students who received the best grade A, 72 per cent studied mandarin chinese, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently free-selective substances, but they are kept at the same value as natural sciences ( science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school study programme and elsewhere.
On the basis of a survey carried out by the UK Employment Office in 2014, 17% of the situation in which the employer had difficulty finding a suitable worker was explained in a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary to promote the future career development of young people.
The more possible work tasks require language skills, the more essential these skills become in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he has a privileged position in the future for this lifelong skill, regardless of the career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically to put a person with language skills ahead of competition.
According to a survey carried out by YouGov in 2013, 75% of more than 4 000 iso-Brittannian adults are unable to speak in a foreign language, and France was the only language that was qualified by a double number of 15%.
This is why investing in teaching languages is important for current children.
In particular, learning the languages of developing countries will give children a better chance to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
A number of schools focus on traditional languages, while some are specifically teaching languages that are supposed to be important to the iso-Brittannians in 2020, such as Mandarins and Japanese.
Despite the objects of your child’s interest, private schools always have a number of language options taught by specialised teachers.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills needed for success, whatever the future will bring.
In this time, we cannot deny that in the international business environment the languages will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must reflect on education.
Indeed, today’s languages should be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high level for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the SCIS Department of Private Schools in Scotland
LeBron's making a debut on Sunday at San Diego.
LeBron James' first performance in the Los Angeles Lakers lines is almost over.
Coach Luke Walton of the Lakes has announced that James is playing against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego in a game to play before the beginning of the season.
But how many minutes he really plays, we'll see.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell twitted that James is probably playing incomplete minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six fights before the Lakers.
"In this phase, I don't need any more premature games to prepare," he said.
Time for Trump's Western Virginia campaign, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five elections planned for Trump next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for the vote, Trump seeks to increase support for the forthcoming interim elections, as Republicans are at risk to lose a majority in the November Congress.
What time is Trump's Western Virginia campaign today, and how do you see it online?
The event of Trump West Virginia Wheeling begins at 7:00 east coast on Saturday 29.9.2018.
You can view Trump's Western Virginia campaign event online as a livestock trip via YouTube clicking downstairs.
Trump is probably taking a stand for the hearing of the supreme judge Brett Kavanaugh this week, who became heavily suspicion of sexual harassment, which has delayed the senate's confirmation vote once in the week of the FBI's investigation.
But the primary objective of the campaign series is to support the success of the Republican candidates in strict elections in November.
Therefore, the five events of President Trump's campaign were commented on, the purpose of these five events next week is to "weep the volunteers and profitable Republicans to protect and extend the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of the Congress is so essential for him that the President is ready to travel to both state and potentially during a pressing campaign period", told Reuters by the anonymous representative of the Trump campaign.
Today's event is in Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and there are even "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit during the current month to West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports the republican Western Virginia senator candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has left behind in opinion surveys.
"It is not a good sign from the Morrisey point of view that the President is trying to increase his support for opinion surveys," said the state scientist Simon Haeder from the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team demonstrates a willingness to maintain hope before Sunday alone games
After three one-sided sessions, the four games on Saturday afternoon were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, players believe in it, and more in tournaments like this.
Where is this prosperity to them at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead, which went down to four, so we take this success as the tip," said Jordan Spieth when he walked away by the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, a privileged position: four points above and 12 to play.
The Americans, as Spieth said, experience that they have a little wind in their sails and much of which to be encouraged, such as Spieth and Justin Thomas, to play all day together and get three points from four.
Spieth has been overwhelming from the road to the green, and leads with an example.
The vicious throat sounds of the winner party were intensified in the course of his cycle, when he succeeded in a critical pot to set the match evenly to four when he and Thomas were two points behind two holes.
The puzzle they won the 15th game followed a similar cry that gave the impression that he believes that the United States team has not yet lost.
"You have to focus really well and only take care of your own fight," said Spieth.
That's the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players who have received more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the uncontroversial legends of Ryder Cup Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
The special but sweet twin in Europe has won four of the four incorrectly.
"Moliwood" was the only twin who did not make any bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and get energy from this cheerful audience, confirms that they're pre-pants on Sunday. And when the sun drops in Le Golf National, the second most popular player could not be Fleetwood and Molinari to ensure a possible victory in Europe.
I prefer both at the same time with different holes.
However, the talks about Europe's success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Alex Noren's coupled Sergio Garcia, a hero of the four-game this morning.
One bogi and two doublebogs in the first nine holes dug up so deep into the Spanish and Swedish hole that they were not even near to survive.
But on Sunday, no one's coming to help you out of the hole.
Four balls and four-games are fascinating to follow close to partners from the perspective of cooperation: what kind of advice they give or leave without giving, and how the strategy can change in time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this four-game has shown that the United States team has a willingness to fight, although it has been suspected in particular in the United States.
Europe will take 10-6 leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup, after they took a 10-6 lead from the United States on Saturday's four-balls and four-games.
The great twin Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the victory of two wins from Tiger Woods, and they got the scores high to four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who worked hard to keep the victory that he lost two years ago in Hazeltin, managed the weakly played American team in the morning's four-ball, taking the game into position 3-1.
The United States were a harder opponent in the four-games winning two fights, but they were not able to diminish leadership.
Jim Fury's half needed eight points from Sunday 12 to keep the victory.
Fleetwood is the first European initiator who has won four points in succession. He and Molinari, also called "Molliwood", were a sensational weekend after Ryder Cup's history with another twin, which has won four points in the first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed first in four balls, they completed the overly depressed Woods and the United States launcher Bryson Dechambeau even more profoundly 5-4.
Woods, who barely survived the two games on Saturday, was sometimes very brilliant, but has lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and four games, and even seven in one row.
Justin Rose rested on the morning's four balls, but he returned to the four-game with Henrik Stenson, but it lost 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks on the Hawk, first and third.
Europe did not get everything in the way that it wants to be cute and enjoyable on this day from Paris to lunch.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, the three-fold winner, set a high target for the Americans on Saturday two points.
They gain 2-1 victory from the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls, and then 4-3 wins from Poulter and Rory McIlroy after the first two holes were destroyed.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team has risen from four points in the rear drive position at the start of the double games, although the even game on the Furyk side is enough to maintain the victory.
However, after two days, the second best may be that the attack on Sunday is too requested.
North Korea's "no way" is taking off weapons without trust
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that continued sanctions only raised mistrust in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that North Korea should give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said at the United Nations General Assembly that in the last year, North Korea has taken "significant goodwill measures", such as having stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the test site of nuclear experiments and promised that North Korea would not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
"But we haven't seen such a gesture from the United States," he said.
"There is no confidence in the United States that we cannot be sure of maintaining national security, so, in such circumstances, it is not possible to take off ourselves unilaterally."
Although Ri reiterated the fact that Washington did not accept the gradual resignation of nuclear weapons in which North Korea would be rewarded for each matter, his statement is significant in the sense that the unilateral displacement of weapons was not completely excluded, as Pjongjang has previously done.
Mr Ri referred to the joint statement given by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S. president and North Korean leader's summit in Singapore on 12 June. In his statement, Kim assured the "restricted the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons" and Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has attempted to formally decide the Korean war between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has demanded that Pjongjang should first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also objected to facilitating the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States demands "mydnery first", and they have increased pressure through sanctions to achieve their goals by means of forced force – even in opposition to the "rest," Ri said.
"The need for sanctions to get us on our knees is the hope of the uninterested ones.
But the problem is that continual sanctions only deepen our distrust."
Mr Ri did not mention the plans to organise the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself pointed out earlier to the UN this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings with the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party requiring disarming South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to such a dead end."
Yet Rin's voice tone was considerably different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the United States continental areas was inevitable after the "devil President" Trump called Kim a "rail man" with suicide intentions.
Last year, Trump threatened to "destruct completely" North Korea. However, this year, Trump commended Kim for its courage to approach the resignation of weapons, but emphasised still that there is much left to work and the sanctions must remain until North Korea resigns from nuclear weapons.
Wednesday Trump mentioned that he did not have a time limit: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should reward the progress made by Pjongjang.
However, the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the strengthening of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be strong and failing as long as we testify to a complete, final and reinforced set of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with its aim to dismantle the financial channels for the production of ballistics and nuclear missiles in Pjongjang.
Pompeo met in connection with the United Nations General Assembly of the North Korean Rin, and also announced that he would visit Pyongjang again next month for the preparation of the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times in this year, but the latest visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pjongjang, he described progress, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gongsterian requirements" only a few hours later.
North Korea committed itself to a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event of the United States carrying out "correlational measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "compliant measures" security guarantees Trump committed to the Singapore meeting and moving towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students complete an adequate rest instruction course
At Harvard University, all primary students participate this year in a course aimed at increasing student relaxation. The course is a counterattack to a florating macho culture in which students weigh a long night with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite unaware of their own well-being basic issues.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Medical Faculty of Harvard University, who works in the Brigham and Women's Hospital for Sleeping Studies, believes that the course is the first of its species in the United States.
Czeisler received an idea for the course after lectured on the effect of sleep shortages on learning.
"Now after the lecture, a young woman came to my address, who said, "Why do I not hear it now, as my last grade? "
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I thought was surprising," he said in the Telegraph interview.
For the first time this year, the course organised guides students about how real unity support academic and sporting performances and improves public well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of the University of Harvard Medical Faculty and Vice-President of the University Health Services, says that the university has completed a course after they had heard how students suffered serious sleep shortages during the study week.
An hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section shows students a picture of the housing room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, and thus obtain information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep short on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section tells participants how long-term sleep deficiency can raise the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive photographs encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
"We know that this does not have an immediate effect on the behaviour of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these matters just as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," Professor Czeisler adds.
According to Professor Czeisler, the study rhetorones lasting all night are still the subject of pride, and modern technology and the ever growing pressures of students made the problem of sleep shortage.
"To have sufficient and high-quality sleep should be the 'secret weapon' of students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even against the increase in weight, as sleep deficiency causes a hunger-like state in the brain, which is why man is constantly hungry," says the professor.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler to plan a course after he had participated in one of the courses he taught in his first year in Harvard last year.
He says that the course opened his eyes and gave him an impulse to organising a comprehensive course for all campus students.
He hopes that all further students would be able to complete a similar study group before the transition to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students have a wake watch to remind them of bedtime, in addition to morning wake, and urges them to keep in mind the adverse effects of electronic screening devices and LED lights on daylight, which may make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot took a win from Gerrard's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers once again experienced a new defeatful day when Dolly Menga's shot through the disrupted defense brought Livingston a 1-0 win.
Ibrox players were picking up their first victory after the 4-1 game of February, which went against St. Johnstone. Gary Holt's team, however, took the victory this time, and Gerrard now only experienced another loss during his 18-game manager career. Rangers remained eight points from the current leader of the eloligue Hearts.
Menga drew seven minutes before half, and then, with the battle - down Rangers, the situation was no longer compensated.
As a result of the game, the Rangers fell to the sixth position. Livingston has instead climbed to the third position, and the goal difference is only above Hibernia.
Rangers may have other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when hit the object that was thrown from the guest view, and the wound had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight switches to the assembly where the team had hit Ayr and advanced to the semifinals of the Scottish league.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 assembly, where the team took a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy again produced a result when the well-established assembly managed to discipline the opponent almost every turn.
Although Rangers managed to dominate the ball's possession, Livingston was better to use the situations for his own good.
Livingston had the opportunity to get the goal in two minutes, when the first pass of Menga gave Scott Pittman a free way to Allan McGregor's goal.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free trap to Craig Halkett, but the other defender, Alan Lithgow, only managed to squeeze widely in the back.
Rangers took control of the game on the other hand, but in the last third of the game the air no longer had confidence.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when he and Steven Lawless had encountered each other at fifteen minutes, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian requests.
Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. However, Liam Kelly, former Ibrox goalkeeper, rejected the invincible shot of Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
The Livingston goal in 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the hard work of the team.
Rangers couldn't still do anything to Jacobs' long-distance tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who coldly gave the ball to Menga for easy paint.
At the switcher, Gerrard decided to change Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The change almost immediately affected the game when Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, Kelly was interrupted by the attack.
Livingston put visitors to play their own game again, while Lithgow and Halkett continued their long shots after each other.
The Holt team had the opportunity to raise their leadership in the final moments of the game, but McGregor's great defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow got to his position in the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who came from the Rangers exchange, also demanded a punishment with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked away.
Almanakka: Geiger meter inventor
Next page on our Sunday Morning apple: September 30th, 1882. John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany this day 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. Invention later led to the development of a device known as a geiger meter.
The method became one of the science support pillars, and the instrument also became a key concept of pop culture. For example, the film "Coronado Watches" appeared in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans present scientists that are very influenced by cattle shepherds:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers, "It's a geiger meter, it's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put your headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals."
Evans: "Look, now you're really on the wheel!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63th birthday.
It's an invention that still holds his name.
The new cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system 'to see' malicious cells
The new cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system 'to see' malicious cells and destroy them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of the treatment
In the process, resistance cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are capable of ‘seeing’ the typical proteins of several cancers.
The coronary tissue has provided promising results in patients with different cancers.
For example, cancer cells in patients with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In the process, resistance cells are isolated from the patient and transformed in the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ the HER2-proteins typical to many cancers. The modified cells are injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: "On the basis of our results, this is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "directs the growth of several types of cancer," Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer and ovaries, lungs and colons eat."
A similar approach – taking resistance cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West went to the teeth of critics after glorifying the campaign hat in Trumpy Saturday Night Live.
The show didn't go as planned.
Kanye West received bounties in her neck in the Saturday Night Live entertainment program, following the glorious style of President Donald Trump, and by reporting to be president in the elections of 2020.
After performing his third song "Ghost Town" Trumpin Make America Great Agai, the campaign hat, the West attacked the Democrats and repeatedly supported President Trump.
"When they talk to a white man, they ask me how I can support the Trumps because he's a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
The mission of the Senate began with a sketch where Matt Damon was grieved to consult Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Judicial Committee, which relates to the claims made by Christine Blasey Ford about sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
West's Passover was not presented in a direct broadcast, but comic Chris Rock downloaded a cut into social media.
I don't know if Rock's trying to mock West with his post.
In addition, West complained that the audience had been mistreated because of the hat held on their heads.
"I was bullied behind the cults.
They told me I shouldn't go to the stage with this hat in my head.
I've been bullied!
And then they say I'm in the margin," says West at the Washington Examiner interview.
West continues, "Do you want to see what the margin means?" and says she's dressing her Superman's hint because, "so you can't prescribe what I'm doing. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
According to Varietty, West’s comments were at least twice astonished from the audience, and the performers of the show seemed embarrassed. One present described the situation for the magazine as follows: "The whole studio became completely quiet."
West was selected to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
In many viewers, West was confused by the presentation of the song "I love it" as a perrier bottle.
West receives support from Candace Turner, the head of the Conservative TMPUSA, who praised this courage on Twitter: "THANK YOUR THROUGH THROUGH."
However, Mr Karen Hunter, the leader of the debate programme, pointed out that West "is only his own, which is always wonderful."
"I can, however, decide to be a person (by buying this music or clothingmark or by supporting this "art" which I think is supporting and disseminateing ideology which is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same applies to us," he added.
Before the night he appeared on Twitter, the rapist announced that he had changed his name to a "person known earlier as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name. A musician is following Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course, we also remember Prince of the extinct music legend, who changed his name to a symbol and later to a artist known as Prince.

Kit Harington, an actor of the power play, attacks poisonous masculine.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-shooting hero role as Jon Snow'na HBO in the violent fantasy series of the Volunteer Game.
Harrington has, however, attacked the stereotype of the Machosankar: According to the 31 - year - old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned by hardship.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Cultural Interface, Harrington suspects that "something has gone wrong" and questions the means available to address toxic masculine in the time of the MeToo phenomenon.
Even recently, Harrington, married to a star map of the Power Game, including the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, admits that he has a strong desire to intervene.
"The question where we have gone wrong with masculinity makes me feel powerful at the moment," he says.
"What has been taught to men in the years of their growth that has led to problems that are now detected?"
Harrington believes that television and the very masculin figures in it are partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continues to say, "What's inside born, and what's learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel that they have to be certain to be men?
I believe that this is one of the great questions of our day – how can we change this?
'Cause there's something really bad wrong with young men.'
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of pre- or follow-up parts of the Power Game after the series ends next summer, because he has, according to his own words, "get needed from battlefields and horses".
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play, True West, who tells about the film producer and his robbery brother.
The actor recently revealed that acquaintance with his future wife, Rose, was the best thing that the Power Game has offered him.
"I met my wife in this show, so somehow it gave me my family and my life from then," she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the target of Jon Snow's love played by Harrington in an Emmy-recorded fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's farms in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: The number of new infections has increased by 14 % in China
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-related citizens.
According to health authorities, the virus touches more than 820 000 people in the country.
Approximately 40 000 new cases have only been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of the new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Usually HIV has spread rapidly through contaminated blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the Yunnan province conference, HIV infections in this way have been almost reduced to zero.
A year later, however, the number of HIV infected and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 cases.
HIV infections occurring through sex are an acute issue in the LGBT Community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men are eventually married to women due to the conservative values of the country.
Many of these diseases are due to insufficient protection in such relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to ensure the overall availability of HIV medicines as part of the problem-solving measures.
Maxine Waters contends on the data of the republikeinist who leaked the worker and accuseses the spread of dangerous lies and secret alliance theories.
On Saturday, a member of the United States Representative's House, Maxine Waters, contested the allegations that his employee would have published personal information on three Republican speakers on the Wikipedia websites.
The Democratic Representative from Los Angeles assured us that the disseminaters of claims are "excellence rights" commentators and websites.
"A lie, a lie and more disgraceful lies," says Waters in a statement published on Twitter.
Among the published information, it is reported that it was the home addresses and telephone numbers of the senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina, and of the senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch representing the state of Utah.
The unknown person published information on the United States Congress on Thursday during the consultation of the Senate Committee. The hearing concerned the accusations of sexual abuse against Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate of the Supreme Court.
The bleeding occurred a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Punds and Red State reports that according to Hill's newspaper, messages were published from the IP address attached to Waters' office and by the staff of Waters.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and it's an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My employees, whose identity, identity and safety have been compromised by these false and false charges, are not responsible for the leaking of these information.
This unfounded accusation is totally wrong and absolutely a lie."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, and the critics also included the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleisher.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," wrote Fleisher.
"It seems that his nature is not suited to a congressman.
When someone is accused of something that he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There's no reason to be dreadful.
There's no reason to question the prosecution's motives.
In the situation, you must behave gently and calmly."
Mr Fleisher seemed to compare the reaction of Mr Waters to democratic criticism against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during the Thursday hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes from Waters' place in the Congressional elections, has also expressed its views on Twitter.
"I can't believe if this is true," he says.
Waters stated in his opinion that he contacted the "approved authorities and law enforcement bodies for these fraudulent accusations.
"We are convinced that the authors will be revealed," he continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all the devastating and dangerous actions against some or all of my staff members."
Johnny English strikes again – sub-efficient Rowan Atkinson Agent Parodie
The tradition has already been established to look for brexit references in any little film around Britain. However, this does not appear to be suitable for the Johnny English agent's parade and operating comma series, which began in 2003 on the Johnny English track and relived in the next part of 2011, "Johnny English – Newborn".
Can the language of the nation’s satire in cheek become a new national export refund in Britain?
Either way, the cocky-eyed, gum-faced and incompetent Johnny English has already earned his permission to do it again. His name is above all about the fact that this is a comic creation that is directed to the non-English world film market.
It is, of course, the dumb secret agent who desperately seeks to breathe around the melting glamour, but it appears as a mix of inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and its unhappy one note musician at the 2012 opening concert in London.
The bottom of the ham is the cosmopolitan and mystic world man that Atkinson played in the originally forgotten Barclaycard TV ads.
The latest performance, yes, has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives on a helicopter dressed in a medieval harnas, and the rotator's stages skull his helmet.
The gifts of Atkinson's physical comedy come out, but the humor itself seems sub-efficient and oddly unnecessary, especially because ‘stable’ film bands, such as 007 and the hazardous task nowadays offer humor as part of the main content of the film.
My sense of humor seems oriented to children, and I don't think the crazy treatment of Johnny English seems as smart and sharp as the comedy of Mr. Bean's spike roles in Atkinson.
The year-on-year basis is that the UK is in trouble for the worst time.
Cyber hacker has infiltrated the British top secret spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents operating on the field as the deploration of an agent in service – which is presented as the unfortunately small role performance of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop to the Prime Minister in the main beans and in the surface, which is already finished by the political imbalance: Emma Thompson will do everything in Teresa May's hair, but the manuscript just does not offer him enough space.
When advisors of the intelligence service inform him that all spies on the field have been revealed, someone who has already moved away from active service must be invited.
This is, of course, a twisted Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement days as a teacher in a fine school, but at the same time he gives informal lessons in the nobles of spying.
English is commended to the emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he again meets his endless, patient battle partner Bough, who is still being played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, whose role Vicki Pepperdine seems to have no right.
Thus, the catastrophal Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty’s secret service to meet the super criminal Ophelia Bhuletovan, acting by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is going to be manipulated by a charismatic IT-military.
English and Bough's Odysseys are transformed into a farce right away: a two-shirt, dressed as waitresses, lights up a fine French restaurant and causes chaos in the secret pursuit of Volta's luxury hunting. The company is familiar with Volta's house with virtual glasses, which ends up in a clean anarchy in the real world.
Even the last events of the authors are shaking at the end of the scene, but despite all the influential and attractiveness, the film still seems a little bit to be done on the childhood.
You can keep the picture moderate.
When watching Johnny English films, I have already reached the same thought: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would justify his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week with five-day salary
The Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is thinking about a radical plan that the British would work for four days a week, but the wage would be paid for five days.
It is reported that the party will require business leaders to transfer the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution to workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, workers could enjoy the three-day weekends with the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of ‘sopsi’ is for the party's economic programme and its plans to cost policies to the benefit of workers.
The Association of Professional Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means of benefiting workers from changing economic situation.
The source of the High Level Labour Party tells Sunday Times: "The revision of the line was announced before the change of year.
This change will not take place in the moment, but a four-day working week is the objective that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy for workers and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party is not the first body that supports the idea: the Green Party in Britain committed to support the move to a four-day working week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective will not receive undistributed support in the Labouri lines.
The reporter of the Labour Party states: "Four-day working week is not a party's line, and the party is not considering such a move."
John McDonnell, Minister of Finance of the Shadow Government, used the working conference held last week to present his vision of economic revolution.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to recover power from "growing-free dictators" and "trainers" of companies of general interest.
According to the Minister of Finance of the shadow government, current shareholders of water companies would not be allowed to re-establish their share as the government under the leadership of Labour could act on the basis of the irregularities found.
He also confirmed the plans to set employees in corporate management and to create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the private sector’s share capital to the management of employees.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing in the 60 minutes programme about whether the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The investigation of prosecutions against Brett Kavanaugh, Judge of the FBI, has delayed at least a week's final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as Judge of the Supreme Court, and the delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republicanists to Kavanaugh's appointment.
In the 60-minute period of the programme on Sunday, the correspondent of the program, Scott Pelley, asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it would be possible that the FBI finds out things that would allow them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared opener than his Southern Carolian colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said by the time I heard... I said I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when the accusations came out, and I asked him, “Did you do it?”
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, instead, looks like a stone cut.
"I've made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it's a bombproof," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett has strongly disputed it," Graham added Christine Blasey Ford, referring to.
"None of the people he appointed could confirm it.
It's about a 36-year-old thing.
I can't see what could change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, which will be held in New York on Saturday, is a music event with a card as impressive as its mission: the eradication of poverty from the world.
Now, the seven-time Global Citizen Festival attracts tens of thousands of people to the lawns of the Central Park of New York to listen to performers, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real goal of the event: the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a follow-up to the Global Powerty Project, the international Advisory Group, aimed at eliminating poverty by increasing the number of people actively actively active in the eradication of poverty.
In order to obtain a free ticket to the event (when it is not willing to pay for the VIP ticket) the public must perform various tasks or "works", such as volunteering, sending a email to the political decision-makers or calling a call, or performing any other act that disseminates awareness of the project's objectives.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded, now that there is no longer 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of a free concert ticket rewarding a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘clintivity’ among others – the idea that the world can be changed by signing a web adress or sending a Twitter?
Global Citizen reports that it has recorded more than 19 million "works" for different objectives since 2011.
It argues that these acts have encouraged political decision-makers to report commitments and principles that correspond to more than 37 billion dollars and have been used in a way that affects more than 2.25 billion people's lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations on the basis of which more than 10 billion dollars have already been used or collected.
The Group estimates that the funds achieved have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in Great Britain, who has committed to "help children to develop their potential in full." The group committed to providing Rwanda $35 million to end the underspeed in the country. This happened after the activists had sent them 4 700 TVs following the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks the British Government, donors, governments of different countries, and, just like you, world citizens, we can transfer social injustice to the newspapers of the history of underestimation," Power of Nutrition's ambassador Tracey Ullman said to the public at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the Group, the British Government was also invited to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children with more than 5 000 works. The government has published funding for a Power on Nutrition project, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the often asked questions on the website of the movement is: "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global citizen's answer: "It's going to be a long and hard one, and there are many stubborn stones ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, such as large civil rights fights and movements against apartheid before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are running the New York concert this year, and its star map includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Home Affairs, the country can make energy exports difficult by using the fleet as a "prevention"
According to the Washington Examiner magazine, the US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke, Washington can "if necessary" use its fleet to prevent the proliferation of Russian energy, including in the world market.
Zinke claims that Russia's activities in Syria – the invitation of the legitimate government – are an excuse for the symbolisation of new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that [Russia] is responsible for the presence in the Middle East, just like in Eastern Europe, the southern half of Europe," Zinken said.
According to the Authority, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
"United States have the ability to keep their shipping routes open with their fleet and, if necessary, by seating to ensure that the energy they offer does not reach the world market," he says.
Zinke spoke to the public of the event organised by the Energy Consumers Association, a group of non-profit groups that are profiled as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that this is one and the same.
"The financial option for Ireland and Russia is more or less speculation, and the replacement of fuel in another," he says, and he describes Russia as a "one trick circus number" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The opinions are scheduled in a situation where Trump's administration has sought to intensify the export of LNG to Europe and replace it with a much more favourable Russian LNG.
To enhance this, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unapproved" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, binds Berlin to the Moscow Farmer.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transport capacity of 110 billion cubic metres of the current pipeline, as a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that there are purely economic reasons behind the opposition to Washington, and considers it an example of unhealthy competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier," says the Russian Minister for Energy Aleksandr Novak, when he met US energy minister Rick Perryn in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has caused a counteract in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industrial roof organisation, the German Industrial Union, has called on the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that a third country is involved in our supply of energy," Mr Dieter Kempf, the head of the German Industrial Union, recently said after the meeting of the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, intends to consider carefully" to be a candidate in the presidential elections in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced on Saturday that he would "be careful" after the elections for presidential candidates.
Warren confirmed that he would consider a candidate for an open survey in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and repair our defective regime, and this also means a woman at the head of the kingdom," he said The Hill.
"After the sixth day of November, I'm going to think carefully about becoming a presidential candidate."
Warren estimates President Donald Trumps at the time of the opportunity, saying, "I think he's taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I am worried about what Donald Trump will do to our democracy," he says.
Warren has appeared in a straightforward criticism of the Trumps and the candidate of this Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a TV that he published on Friday, Warren wrote, "I'm sure we need a FBI investigation before we vote."
However, according to the opinion published on Thursday, the majority of Warren's electorates do not support this as a candidate in 2020.
According to a study carried out by the University of Suffolk political research institute and Boston Globe, 58% of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts are not in favour of a senator's status.
32% was in favour of becoming candidates.
More of the respondents supported the resignation of former Governor Deval Patrick by 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent democratic candidates that have been raised in the discussions are, for example, former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press News Office, Biden has said that he has formally decided on his nomination by January.
Sarah Palin refers to the war traumas of her son at Donald Trump's electoral meeting.
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, spent 26 years in Iraq after recruiting the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested against Monday night and was charged with family violence.
"For what my own son has to go through when I return home, I can be well identified with other families who face the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our soldiers will return home," he told the audience at the election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Donald Trump.
Palin called the arrest “a river horse in the living room” and said his son, like the other war veterans,“ returning home with a little change, they come back hard and wondering whether he and his companions in the army and in the air forces have done this country.”
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to the police reporter Dan Bennett in Wasilla, he was charged with family violence and the abuse of a woman, family violence and the handling of a weapon.
18 states and the Columbia Federation support a new asylum policy action
Eighteen states and the Columbia Federation are applying for a change in the new approach in force in the United States, which states that asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
The 18 state and alliance representatives have left the letter "Friends of Justice" on Friday in Washington, Washington.
The full name of the lawyer has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions file, which was raised by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal rule.
He tells his partner, "and his sons of his violent gang," he was abused by the U.S. authorities, who denied him asylum 20.7.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, most of which are home to the United States, countries where gang and family violence are a problem that has spread to all levels of society.
The new US asylum policy repealed the 2014 decision of the Board of Appeal for Asylum, which allowed unwritten migrants to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
The General Attorney General of the Columbia district, Karl Racine, commented on Friday in his statement that the new line " ignores the states, the federal and the international law for decades".
"The law of the Member State requires that all applications for asylum be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle is a violation of this principle" says the letter of the right of friends.
In a letter, the prosecutors also claim that the practice of preventing access to asylum seekers will harm the US economy, as admissioners are likely to become entrepreneurs and "increasing the necessary additional workforce".
In June, the Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the incoming judges to suspend the issue of asylum from the victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Secrecy is intended for persons who flee from their home country due to persecution or fear caused by their nationality, religion, nationality or a particular social class or political opinion"
Asylum was never meant to solve all problems — even serious problems — which people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu – the number of deaths found has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more serious.
"Your house is very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming down her hot baby at the evacuation centre in the ruined city.
"The ambulances bring new bodies for a minute.
Pure water is scarce."
People return to their ruined homes, pick up their watered things and try to save what is yet to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and 7.5 hospitals damaged by magnetism are full.
Some injured people, such as Dwi Haris, who suffer from a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital, where patients are treated for ongoing, powerful postmortems.
His eyes are filled with tears when he was cheering up how a raging earthquake shaken the fifth floor of the hotel room he distributed with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the wall between the ruins, I think." Harris says "Associated Press" and tells me that he and his family were married in town.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The American Ambassador is accusing China of provocation by "propagandal declarations"
The Chinese ambassador is accusing Peking of using the American magazine as a propaganda instrument, which will take place a week after the Chinese newspaper had published a four-page advertisement in the United States newspaper, which praises the mutual interests of the trade agreement between the United States and China.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump of the United States referred to the paid annex of the China Daily newspaper Des Moines Register, which is the largest newspaper of the state of Iowa, accused China of being involved in the Congress elections of 6.11.
According to the U.S. authorities who spoke to Reuters, Trump’s accusations of Beijing’s attempts to interfere with the elections in the United States constitute a new stage in the Washington enlarging campaign to push China.
Although it is normal for the foreign government to disseminate declarations to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently tied to always escalating trade wars, where both parties in turn impose customs duties on export products from the counterparty.
According to Chinese and American experts, Chinese vengeance tariffs were targeted at the beginning of the trade war by states such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the Chinese ambassador and the long-term governor of the State of Iowa, says that Peking was damaged by the American labour force, farmers and companies. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now stimulating its provocation by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press" wrote Branstad in his opinion paper on Sunday Des Moines Register.
"The Chinese government, by relaxing its propaganda, will benefit from the renowned free word and press traditions of the United States by setting a declaration paid in the Des Moines Register", writes Branstad.
"In the peking streets, however, there are only limited differences in opinions, and the real, different opinions that Chinese citizens can not see from the alarming development of their economies. This is because the media is strictly in the Church of the Communist Party of China," he writes.
Branstad will continue by telling us that "one of the biggest newspapers in China was not likely to publish the offer" a article he wrote, but does not specify what paper is going on.
Kavanaugh's kid is deporting women's voters from the Republicans, and analysts warn you.
The fact that many of the tops of the Republicans are standing behind and defending him, Brett Kavanaugh, the judge of the Supreme Court, can, according to analysts, cause counteract, especially in the forthcoming interim elections with female voters.
The emotions surrounding the case have been on large circuits, and most Republicans have already declared their desire to proceed in the vote.
"You can't cancel these things," says Professor Grant Reeher from the Maxwell Institute of Syracuse University in The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher doesn't believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republikeinen, Arizona) of the last minute's offer to reconcile the FBI's investigation with angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor of the National Reform Group, and the Mediator of MoveOn on Friday in the capital.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang "marching to come" in the Senate Corps when the ruling Republicans of the Judicial Committee decided to proceed to the appointment of Kavanaugh, which, despite Dr. Christine Blasay Ford's statement of testimony, was reported by Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be judged," says Stu Rothenberg, an unbinding political analyst in an interview on the news site.
"The people say that the enthusiasm has already been high, and it is true.
But it could be even bigger, especially with the insecure female voters of neighbours and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who often do not vote because they do not like the President."
Analysts are anticipating a possible counteract if the Republicans are moving forward with confirmation already before Ford's statement of evidence against the candidate of the Supreme Court, in which it put their allegations of sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former President of the National Committee of the Republicans, at the beginning of last week.
"This is not just a committee vote or a final vote, or a question of whether Kavanaugh is being questioned: it is about how the Republicans have acted and how they have dealt with Fordia," Guy Cecil, the head of the Group of Democrats in the United States, commented on the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in whether they should believe in Ford or Kavanaugh’s witness statements when a small majority tended to the latter.
According to the new opinion survey carried out by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe that Ford's statement of witnesses is definitely or likely, while 35% say that he is absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say that Kavanaugh is likely or definitely lying in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's burst, the FBI is investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
In front of the Court of Justice, Ford testified to Kavanaugh, harassing him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court has revealed to him his family at the student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor is planning to start a new internet as an opponent for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, World Wide Web inventor, has launched a start-up company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee open source code Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their information is stored and who has access to any information.
In an interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee jokes about Inrupt's purpose is to control the world.
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his startup company.
"It's an historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data warehouse" or POD.
It may contain lists of contact information, memo lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
The unique nature of the personal data warehouse is that the user is fully attached to who has access to the type of information.
The company calls it "for personal enforcement through information".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to provide resources, processes and required skills to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently comprises a safety platform purchased by Berners-Leen, Bruce, IBM, some hired developers working with the project and a community consisting of voluntary coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website. This is all available since this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not discussing "Facebook and Google about whether people should be offered a complete change in which all their business models will be turned to their heads at night".
"We're not asking for their consent."
In a article published on Saturday in the media Berners-Lee wrote in Inrupti 'the task of providing commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new Solid network'.
In 1994 Berners-Lee hired the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
During the past months Berners-Lee has been an impressive voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Berners-Lee maintains its position as the founder and manager of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute after the launch of Inrupt.
Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers the hero priest of World War I
The city celebrates the only priest with the Victoria Cross militar of the Church of England who has been a soldier after the events took place for 100 years.
On 29 September 1818, the medaille was issued to Colonel Bernard Vann as a result of the attack on the villages of Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
However, the vessel died four days later, without ever knowing that he had received the highest honor of the British army.
Two of his grandchildren were revealing a memorial stone in Rushden, a parade in Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says that the event is "acting symbolic"; the monument was revealed equally 100 years after his rewarded grandfather's arrogance.
According to London Gazette, 29 9.1918 Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very thick fog and under the fire of heavy field counters and machine guns."
Later, he fell into the front line, and "indicating the greatest bravery" led to the advancement of the troops before the attack was carried out alone to the field clerk. In the battle followed, Vann put down three cannon patrol soldiers with his own hands.
Colonel Vann died of a German sniper on November 4, 1918 — only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said the act of his grandfather was "something I could never achieve, something that gives me respect."

Michael Vann says it's a great privilege to take part in the parade and adds: "The great multitude of people is remembering the glory of a true hero."
Friends of the Volunteers waited all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – the TV channel looked like Pipsa Pusu
Imagine the situation you've been watching all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event is not presented.
The event program in San José consisted of 13 games, of which six of the main sets of games, and the show was intended to be a direct broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mouseas and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program turned into the great terror of the Pipsa Pussuu viewers.
Some of the viewers were not really pleased to be watched all night for the fight.
One of the friends of the free fight opened up on Twitter, described the replacement of the match with the children's drawing "some kind of sick joke".
"The law states that this content was not suitable for presentation at 6:00 a.m., so they had to change it into the child programme" explained Dave Schwartz, Deputy Director for Marketing and Communication of Bellator's senior Director for the exchange of the programme.
"Pipsa Pig, yes."
Scott Coker, director of the Bellator company, said that the schedules will be worked so that British viewers can follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking about a re-sendment that's probably going to make the program work," said Coker.
"But it will be six in the morning, and we will not be able to perform the program before Sunday in our time, which, in turn, will be their time Monday.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program switched from their heads, messages began to go in the direction and the other, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case, it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
We're going to tie up the number of fights in place of five to six, as usual. We tried to offer more to our fans and we tried too much.
This is a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt underequality because of her sexuality.
Swimming jumper and Olympic sporter Tom Daley says that he felt less valuable than anyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete tells me he only noticed when he came to high school that "not everyone is the same as me."
In the Radio 4 on Lauren Laverne, Daley spoke in the Desert Island Discs program, she said that she spoke about the rights of gay people to give others the hope.
He also tells us how it was not so important to win in the Olympics after having a child.
Kristy Young, a regular player of the long-term radio program, has taken several months off because of disease.
As a guest in Laverne's first programme, Daley said that she felt like she was younger than everyone else, because it was not socially acceptable to boys and work.
He says: “To this day, these feelings, feel less and different have been reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I needed to succeed.”
He says that he wanted to show himself ‘something’ so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality would eventually be revealed.
A double Olympiapronsimist has become a LGBT activist of a high profile, and he is present in the races of the People's Community this year to appeal to the criminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he feels lucky to be able to live openly without punishment, and he wanted to give 'good' to other people.
Three times the world champion tells his love for the man — the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 — “in surprise. ”
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but she says that the difference in age has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things as young" – she took part in her first Olympics at 14 years of age and her father died of cancer three years later – it is difficult to find another age that would have experienced similar sympathy and conflicts," Daley says.
The couple received a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of which Daley’s "full perspective" has changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, my life would have turned around the win of a gold myth," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than a golden Olympic medal.
Robbie's my Olympic Cultural."
His son was named Daley's father, who died of brain cancer only at the age of 40 in 2011.
Daley said that his father never accepted his death, and one of the last things he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympic tickets, and he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he's not gonna be there anymore to be in the front row," Daley says.
"I kept her hand when her breath stopped, until she really stopped breathing, and she was dead, I finally realized she was not inviolable," she says.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was something I've been dreaming of my whole life – jumping in front of the people in the Olympics. There's no better feeling," Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for his first song movement — the song "Proud" of Heather Small — that raised feelings already when he was preparing for the Olympics, and which still gains his skin for chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs will be sent to BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Half-suited for Mickelson's replacement seat on Saturday Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to be very keen to avoid a recording round in history as an unhappy performance.
Mickelson, who plays in the event played every two years, for the 12th time of a recording event, transferred to the exchange bank by Captain Jim Fury for the time of the Four Ball and Foursom to be played on Saturday.
Usually, the five-fold Major tournament winner of the attention spent half a day as cheerleader and on the other side of the field trying to take over his hit.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, not even held at the top of his career as one of the most accurate drivers, is not an ideal choice for a rigid Le Golf National field, where a long-grown chaperone punishs the inaccurate hits.
If there is not enough opposition to Mickelson in the field itself, the 9th game on Sunday is against the famous British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who plays together with the entrant Tommy Fleetwood, aimed at stimulating all four wins this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind the 12 doubles get the flying leave, the Michelson game can prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed confidence in his player, but what else can we say in the situation?
"He fully understands the role in which he was playing today. He beat me in the back, pity and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's got a lot of confidence.
He belongs to the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined something else, but that's how it went, and this is how we ended up.
He wants to be in that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson's breaking Nick Faldo's record of more of the Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may also mean the end of the man’s Ryder Cup career, which was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half, but, according to Fury, his presence will bring something unspecified to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, clever, he likes fun on people's expense, and he's a funny guy everyone likes company," he explains.
"The younger players must have had fun with him this week.
He's bringing so much more into the team than just a stake in the game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European Team knows how long the lead can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from the experience that Ryder Cup's leading leading role can be a busy trip before the last day's double games.
In 1997, the Danish player made his debut in Valderram, where the side of Seve Ballesteros had a leading position for the Americans, but he found the winner with the calculators just and just with his nose and won with the greatest possible margin141⁄2-131⁄2.
"That reminds us of how we led in valderram, we led in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderram, although very little," said Bjorn, after looking at the 5-3 profits of the 2018 team both on Friday and yesterday, moving to 10-6 leads in the Le Golf National field.
The history will show me and all the other team members that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game isn't over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that prize, and we are only aiming for it.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players that play on our side, but we are aware of what is on the opposite side: the best players in the world."
Pleasured by the fact that his team's players have succeeded in a difficult field, Bjorn adds: "I will never listen until I drop off on such things.
Tomorrow is a whole different thing.
Tomorrow, individual performances will be the priority, and we will talk about different things.
It is wonderful to be in the field with a partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, the player’s capacity will be tested at the bottom.
This is a message that must be sent to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to do the best performance.
Now we have to give up a partner who can go to [the field alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the counterparty Captain Jim Furyk will need a better performance than they could as partners. Except for this, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points from four.
Furyk, on his behalf, has experienced the full translations of the last day into both directions. He was involved in a team won in Brookline before he ended up losing when the European team won "Medinah Wonder".
"I remember every evil word," he answered the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw of the 1999 team handed out the lines of his team to the homes of the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medinah.
When it moves into one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have set up our composition accordingly and put the boys in the field in the way we want, as you know, we're going to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task to try to lead a defense fight and to meet Rory McIlroy in the most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next to meet their European opponents.
"I put the guys of the group in this order, because I think it's going through the whole tournament," Bjorn commented on the choice of double games.
The German new warship is delaying again
The German fleet's latest fregat should have been introduced in 2014. The purpose of the ship is to replace the old-flagged cold-war equipment, but it will be introduced early next year due to defective systems and exploded expense, reports local media.
According to the Military Envoy to Die Zeit, ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin’, the first vessel of the new Baden-Württemberg class, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying after-supply problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
Ships of the four Baden-Württemberg categories ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace old Bremen class fregats.
According to the available information, they are equipped with an effective cannon, missile systems to combat aircraft and surfaces, as well as missile technology, such as radar reflectivity and the detection of infrared and acoustic signals.
The important features of the vessel include its longer maintenance interval – new fregats should be able to operate on the sea for up to two years without going to the home port.
Continuous delays, however, mean that warships representing the top of technology – which are said to be designed to improve the influence of Germany in overseas regions – are already obsolete at the time they enter the service, the Die Zeitung notes.
The bad-ass F125-fregat ended up in the headings last year, when the German fleet officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the shipyard of Bloohm & Voss to Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns the ship after its delivery.
The reason for the return is little known, but the German media has been talking about essential "software and equipment errors" that make a warship incapable of fighting tasks.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because the crew of Baden-Württemberg vessels is about 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen class.
Furthermore, it has been shown that the ship is considerably overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet’s potential for subsequent updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz, with a capacity of 7 000 tonnes, is believed to be twice the weight of ships of the corresponding class used in the Second World War of Germany.
In addition to faulty equipment, there is also a problem with the entire project price sheet.
The price is multiplied to increase the amount of EUR 3.1 billion at the original price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of the use of new fregats have arisen since the German navy has recently been warned that it will shrink.
Mr Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's available ships are "at the lowest.
According to the Authority, the problem has grown over time because old ships have been removed, but no new ships have been provided.
He complained that none of the Baten-Württemberg frogs could have been introduced to the fleet.
The Environment Organisation is listening to the secret life of the bats
A new survey in the upper Scottish region aims to determine how bats exploit the landscape when hunting food.
New research is hoped to bring new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide them in future protection measures.
The research carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland monitors the troubled and dwarf bunkers, as well as earrings and water wings in the area of the botanical garden Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
The study sets specific recording equipment in important points of the region to monitor the operation of bats during the period.
The organisation's employees and volunteers also perform mobile measurements using portable observation devices.
The frequency of the votes, as well as the type of vote, will be ensured by an analysis of experts.
On the basis of the results, a map and report on the environment will be created in which the behaviour of bats can be presented in a large-scale picture of the region.
Rob Dewar, the organization's natural conservation advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the living environment are the most important for bats, and how different species exploit them.
Knowledge helps in the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of grassland and forest management, in a way that takes into account bats and related species.
The populations of Scotland and the UK as a whole have decreased considerably over the last 100 years.
Building and building work threatens the rest of bats and living environments.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as fly papers and certain chemicals used in building materials and attacks on pet cats.
In fact, the flies are not blind.
However, their ears are more useful in catching the catch than in the eyes due to the overhead hunting practices.
Flexibles use advanced eclipsing techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
National Trust for Scotland is an organisation that focuses on the protection of the environment in rural areas, which maintains more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares across the country – and they take the bats seriously.
It has 10 experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of resting places and, in some cases, also animal rescue measures.
The organization has even set up the first and only one in Scotland in the countries of Dumfries and the Threaven Manor in the region of Galloway to protect the bats. The region meets eight of the ten bat species of Scotland.
Farmer David Thompson says the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave is very good for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings and wood and a good living environment in all.
We do not know everything about leaves, so our work here and in other parts of the organization will help us to understand better what the bats need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of checking buildings from bats before rehabilitation, as the destruction of one bat’s resting place can inadvertently cause up to 400 female flea and boy’s death and destroy a whole local population.
Fowls are protected and they are not to be killed, disturbed or destroyed.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Fleet Protection Organisation, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we still don't know how their populations can handle."
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers prepare a case of law against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has stamped the rape charges on him as "false news" and says people want to "advert themselves" by using his name.
The attorneys of Ronaldo have taken action against the allegations of the German Der Spiegel magazine.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been charged with the rape of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a lasvega hotel in 2009.
He's supposed to have paid the victim $375,000 for silence, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared in Instagram's direct transmission to 142 million successors only hours after the submission of claims. A 33-year-old football player strongly rejected the accusations and described them as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've said today, false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player continued smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing for the trial of Der Spiegel on the allegations they have called "unfit reporting of doubts within the scope of privacy protection".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player demands compensation for "the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged case was reported to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported to have met at the nightclub and transferred to the player's room, where he is alleged to rape this anally, according to the papers submitted to the Nevada Clark County Regional Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged event and said that he was a 99% good guy, but whose "one percent" was disappointed.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that a couple had sex, but that it was a mutual agreement.
Mayorga also claims that he had visited the police station and took photos of his injuries in the hospital, but later ended up in a conciliation solution because he was "intimidated about the possibility of revenge" and concerned that he would become a subject of public humiliation.
The 34-year-old now says that he is applying for annulment of the reconciliation procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the agreement to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged deportation of Manchester United, and moved to the Italian power team with a $100 million agreement.
Brexit: Great Britain would "repent forever" the end of the car production
The UK would "forever regret" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after the brexit, said Minister of Industry Greg Clark.
He added that he regarded the declaration by the Toyota British Unit to temporarily suspend production in a factory close to Derby in Burnaston, if Britain is withdrawn from the EU without agreement.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer says that the impact of border delays will be seen as loss of jobs if the Brexit ends without agreement.
A factory in Burnaston, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year. 90% of these were taken to the rest of the European Union.
"I see that if Britain suddenly breaks out of the EU at the end of March, the production of our factory will be interrupted," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Toyota Burnaston Unit.
Other automotive manufacturers in Britain, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed the fears of leaving the European Union in how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has announced that Mini would close its manufacturing plant for a month when the Brexit was reached.
According to car manufacturers, the main concern concerns the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of uncontracted breaks.
Toyota's production line is run by a timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in Britain and the EU, and cars are made from the order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, it can cause disruption at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortcomings.
Keeping more than 24 hours in the Derbyshire factory is, according to Toyota, impossible and the production would be interrupted.
Clark says that the EU relations plan for Theresa May is "warrantly calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need an agreement, and we want the best possible agreement that does not just mean success in the current situation, but that is an opportunity that we must make good use of," he says in the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"Not only Toyota, but also the opinions of other manufacturers show that we must be in a position to continue the series of very well-functioned supply chains so far."
Toyota cannot tell us how long production would be stopped, but warns that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the institution and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union agent in the factory, says, "My experience is that the jobs lost will never return.
The government report says: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House reports
The challenging meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Minister of Justice, Rod Rosenstein, can be "to be moved in a week" around the Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh, due to the obligatory duty, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Attorney Robert Mueller, who, on the other hand, investigates Russia's involvement in elections, the connections between Trump's assistants to Russia and the President's activities to prevent justice.
It has been in Washington for months that Trump is planning to separate the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would jeopardise the neutrality of Mueller's investigation.
Previously this month, the New York Times reported to Rosenstein about the possibility to record secret discussions with Trump, as well as the possibility of resigning the President on the basis of the 25th addendum to the United States Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was reported to have been the resignation of Rosenstein.
However, President Trump was at that time visiting the United Nations in New York, so the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "not preferably" break up with Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed, because the time came up with the consultation of the Senate Judicial Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI study against Kavanaugh on claims, which continued to postpone the vote of the Senate plenary session.
Sarah Sanders, Press Manager of Trump, was performing on the Fox News Sunday program.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said: "It may be next week, this week, it can be postponed again weekly because of everything else that is currently in the highest court.
I always want to keep the press up."
Some journalists might disagree with this argument: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Newsman Chris Wallace asked me why.
Mr Sanders says that the reason for press conferences is due to other reasons than the disposition of TV journalists about the "seeking of attention", but he said, "I do not deny the fact that they are looking for attention."
Sanders, however, made it clear that the direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president keeps more Question Hours than any president before him," he says, and adds further evidence of the communication book, "We have reviewed those numbers."
"The press conferences will still be organised," Sanders said, "but it is incredibly much better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than discussing with me.
We often try to act this way and you have seen that way several times in the past weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump will regularly answer questions when leaving the White House, or when taking part in open occasions or press conferences with those who visit the White House.
It's rare to attend a press conference alone.
This week, in New York, the President may have shown the reason for this when he showed the reporters who had come together unpredictablely and occasionally.
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to workers from EU countries in Scotland in connection with the fears of brexit for the public health system (NHS Scotland)
The Minister for Health has written a letter to workers from EU countries in Scotland's health system in order to express their gratitude and hopes for their stay in the country after the break.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter as long as the UK resignation from the EU remains less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already prepared to cover the costs of applications from EU citizens working on specialised public services.
In his letter Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, the divorce negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
The Government of the United Kingdom has also stepped up the preparations for a possible non-contractual distinction.
I know for all of you, these are uncertain times.
I would therefore like to repeat now how much we appreciate the contribution of each of our employees to citizenship.
Colleagues from all over the EU and outside the EU provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie for the major injury to the emergency operation
The supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrombie, has been in emergency surgery since the team had lost 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports the Tennessea journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's main coach Rod Reed told the journalists that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline, and he simply fell into it," says Reed.
The coaches and the medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before they set him on the couples and took him to the side for a more accurate assessment.
The editor of Tennessee Staten told Chris Harris on the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has undergone surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/wildness of injuries at this stage" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays the first part in the team after his move from Illinois.
He had five tacks on Saturday before he left the game, which makes a total of 18 tacks this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when buying real estate in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when buying real estate in Great Britain. Additional money will be used to help homeless people, according to the new Conservative Party plans.
The aim of the amendment is to neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters
Increasing stamp tax applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year – to help homeless people
Theresa May will be informed today about the higher stamp tax rate to be applied to foreign buyers when buying real estate in Britain. Additional money is used to help homeless people.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper housing and paid attention to good income taxation.
The raising of stamp tax is targeted at people and companies that do not pay taxes to Great Britain, and the additional money will be earmarked to the government's efforts to facilitate the inhabitant's distress.
The additional charge, which is added to the current stamp tax two years ago, in addition to the increases in housing and investment dwellings, may be up to three per cent.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Approximately 13% of London's new buildings are purchased by non-Great UK residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-come buyers to have access to the housing market.
Many wealthy areas in Great Britain, particularly its capital, have become ‘foreign cities’ because several foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
A new approach will only come weeks after Boris Johnson puts the stamp tax reduction as a means of facilitating the purchase of first dwellings for young people.
He blamed the large construction companies for keeping the prices of real estate high by buying and leaving it unbuilding, and urged Prime Minister May to reject the quotas for affordable dwellings in order to correct the 'secure situation' in Britain.
Corby has published a series of proposals for the reform of the housing market, including the restrictions on the mountains and the termination of "confidential exclusions".
He would also like to give the councils more power on matters related to the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May says: "I said last year that I was going to own the British Prime Minister’s dream – that every generation’s life should be better than its predecessor – in return.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that persons who do not live in Great Britain and companies abroad can buy housing as easily as busy British residents.
For too many people, the possession of a home has become a much too far-reaching dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish county team"
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says his "earth goal" is to become a manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotch has been enthusiastic about the challenge of raising a team back on their feet the country's north-east corner.
Ross moved to the Light Stadium this summer after he had guided St. Mirren back to the Scottish electorate last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play in my country's team.
I got into team two, and it was there," Ross tells me about the BBC in Scotland's Sportslied.
"I watched as a child often with my father in Scotland's games at the Hampden, and that's something that's always pulled me back.
This kind of opportunity will only be received if I succeed as a manager of the company."
Ross’ predecessors are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Head of Allo Athletic says that he was not concerned about the entry into the names of his predecessors in the company, who has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"In this moment, I measure my own success with the fact that I can return this company to his eleolithium.
Based on the structure and capacity of the society, it is undoubtedly a consecutive member of the electorate," he says.
"It's not easy to get in there, but I'd probably think I'd have been a success only if I could get the team back on his eloliga."
Ross has only been a manager for three years, first as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and for 15 months thereafter in the Heats Coach Group.
After this, he helped Alloa get up from the fall games of the third series and raised St. Mirren’s fall into champions during the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirkin, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"I was probably in a real pioneer with my career," he recalls the time when he moved to Alloa's leadership.
"I believe it was better to be a manager than a player.
It sounds strange, because I played well, earned a moderately well, and I got to enjoy some relatively great successes.
But playing can be hard.
The player has to deal with a lot of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things as stress and pressure from work, but running the team seems to be the right task.
I always wanted to run a team, and now I'm doing it for my job, and I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life."
The entire interview will be listenable at the Sportsound broadcast on Sunday 30.9, at the radio Scotland frequency at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy the tribute is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m., research shows
The thermal wave in the summer has been kicking the pubs that struggle with the difficulties of Britain, but at the same time gathered more pressure on the restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% in July, but the outputs of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The figures compiled by Peter Martin on the business consultant CGA say: "Continuous sunny weather and longer than it was anticipated for England to participate in the football World Championships, meant that in July the sale of pubs like June was 2.8% higher, while the month for restaurants was even worse.
The fall of 1.8% in the sale of restaurants was only worse in July.
The pooled pubs and bars were the most successful. Their like-for-sales increased more than the decrease in the sales of restaurants.
Pups concentrated on food can also suffer from flame, but less dramatically than restaurant runners.
Looks like people just wanted to drink out of their minds.
The sales of pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% over a month, with a decrease of 3% in food sales."
Paul Newman, a RSM consultant in the field of leisure and hotel restaurant services, says: "The results continue a trend that has continued since the end of April.
The weather and the large social or sports events are still the biggest factors affecting the sale of the external food market.
It is not surprising that the struggle on restaurant chains continues, although the decrease in sales of 4.8% per year is shaking, especially now that the industry is fighting with cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come to the aggravated operators of the sauna, and only time would show if the vibrant temperatures would bring to the most severely needed breathing period.
The combined sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new open restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker is the barometer following the sale of the British pub, bar and restaurant, which collects and analyses the result data in 47 areas from a group of competences with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds. It is considered to be a reliable indicator for the sector.
A fifth of the children secretly accounted for by their parents
A fifth of the children — some up to 11 years old — secret social media accounts with their parents and teachers, research reports:
A study of 20 000 students in higher education revealed the existence of the growing ‘Instagram feiktic accounts’ phenomena
The news raised the concern that sexual content can be shared on accounts.
20% told the students that they had a ‘end-of-account’ that is shown to parents
A fifth of the children, some up to 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20 000 students in higher education revealed the existence of a rapidly growing ‘Instagram feiktic accounts’, which refers to the Instagram website for the distribution of images.
The news has raised fears of publishing sexual content on accounts.
20% of the students told the parents that they had a cleaned ‘end account’ to show them while using other private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager, hoping to be raped after hitting her 13-year-old daughter's secret website.
A study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Rehtorian Negotiating Board (HMC) revealed that 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 had two separate profiles, and half of the respondents admitted to holding secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of the HMC, says: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel the temptation to create online facilities where parents and teachers can't find them."
From Elidh Doyle, the "voice of sportsmen" to the Scottish Athletes Government
Eilish Doyle has been elected as a member of the Scottish Athletes' Government and is taking part in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most rewarded general athlete in Scotland. President Ian Beattie describes the title as a fine opportunity for sporting decision-makers to benefit from the extensive experience gathered at international level in the last decade.
"I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit enormously from his appointment to the government," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I look forward to my role as the horn of athletes, and I hope I can be useful and help direct Scottish sport in the right direction."
Four American sportsmen who won the Olympic Culturals, who won 200 meters and 400 metres of journeys to the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, now acting as a regular commentator for the BBC lost their walking capacity as a result of a transient circulatory disorder in the brain.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I got a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, it's only time to show me how to recover.
This has been an exhausting job, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again, and now I'm already training for thrust!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Advertising with maternal cows shares opinions online
The breast pumping company’s breast-feeding mothers have shared opinions on the Internet by advancing milk cows.
Elvie, making consumer technology, has placed on the market a product called "the first silent and wearable breast pump in the world". Its marketing is accelerated by a language in the cheek and by an advert to the style of music videos, which describes the liberty of the new pump for breast-feeding mothers.
Four real-life mothers dancing in the navels, among other things, in the words of the song: "Yes, I will milk myself, but I will not see the tail" and "if you have not noticed, they are not the roads, but the tits are the tits."
"Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, milk my tracks."
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company caused a debate online.
The video gathering 77 000 readings and hundreds of comments has caused a conflicting reaction in viewers. Many say that it is going to ruin the dairy industry’s daily ‘horrors’.
"The use of cows in advertising of this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and be born so that they can produce milk, but their babies will be stolen shortly after childbirth," one commentant writes.

Another viewer commented: "Intelligently, it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why can't they be used to promote the breast pump for mothers who can keep their baby?"
The third commentator added: "A completely obligatory advertising of reality."
Advertising also gave me defenders: one woman admitted that the advertising was "happy".
"I think this is a great idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I'd get one of those.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product," reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: "This is a fun advertisement for mothers who are pumping (sometimes at work or in toilets) and ‘educating themselves as cows’.
Advertising is not intended to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the video women reveal that they have danced undetectable pumps in their brass.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using the breast pump feel like cows.
Instead, the Elvie pump is completely silent, there are no wires and hoses, and it is unconsciously suitable in the mammals, giving women freedom to move, hold the baby and even go outside during pumping.
Ana Balar, a member and artistic director of the Mother Advertising Office commented: "The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative entry to the market.
By breasting breast-feeding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges related to the use of the breast pump into the light bowl, we brought out the incredibly liberty of the new pump in an amusing and identical way."
Elvie pump's been in the headlines before.
In London’s fashions, the mother of two children played a catwalk in the designer Marta Jakubowski’s costume using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to camp at the Texas border in all silence
The number of young migrants who have been attracted has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly number of crossings has remained relatively unchanged, which is due to the difficulty in investing children in substitute families as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policy adopted by Trump’s administration.
Most subsidiaries are traditionally made up of paperless immigrants, and registration as an alternate family may jeopardise their own residence in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that any substitute families and other adult members of the economy had to give fingerprints and that these data were shared with the entry authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level entry and customs authority, witnessed last week at the Congress that the Agency arrested dozens of people who had requested substitute families for minor immigrants.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"After 80% of people who are either members of the foster family or members of their households are illegally in the country, and most of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue looking for these people," says Albence.
In order to deal with children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that, in some cases, the case must be dealt with in the court within a month of the arrest, instead of the 60-day time limit previously used, the staff of the reception centre shall report.
Many people prefer to appear by means of a video conference rather than by personal hearing their case before the Court of Justice on the issues of immigrants.
Those who are not considered entitled to help will be expelled quickly.
According to the employees of the reception centres and reports published in the last months of the system, the time spent in child imprisonment affects whether children are suffering from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to the lawyers, concerns are highlighted especially in larger establishments, such as Tornillo, where signs of child despair can be missed because of the large size of the facility.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them sufficient time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria orders the United States, France and Turkey to leave immediately.
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been fighting for eight years.
Mr Moualem, who also serves as a prime minister, said that foreign troops are illegally in the country, using the excuse for combating terrorism, and that "they will come with him to act accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died in 2011 and thereafter, and in which millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue the "holy fight until the entire Syria has been cleaned" of both terrorist organisations and "unlawful foreign troops".
There are about 2 000 soldiers in the United States, located in Syria, where they are mainly training and guideing the Kurds and the Arab troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has invested battles to rip out more than 1,000 soldiers' departments.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good for return and accused of "some Western countries" the spread of "irrational fears", which encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have invited the international community and assistance organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted reconstruction aid before the war has been terminated by a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer area at the last rebel base in Idlib has created the opportunity to conduct political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented the massive attack of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the area where three million people live.
However, Mr Moualem has stressed that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including al-Qaida-related al-Nusra's front fighters, which will be destroyed.
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon he will be able to summon the first meetings of the new government and the opposition committee for the establishment of a draft post-war constitution and for the alignment of the road for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to the 'revision of the current constitutional provisions' and warned against interference.
Why Trump is selected for another period
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the elections for 2020 unless, as many of Liberals' viewers are likely to wish, the postpone and the scandal would be prematurely ending his presidential term.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential decision ever!"
To date, no signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers.
After 2014, the figures of the best viewing time have doubled by CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million MSNBC.
Fox News says Nielsen has an average of 2.4 million viewers for the best viewing time compared to the four years ago, and the MSNBC Rachel Maddow Show has reached cable TV: with a maximum viewer of 3.5 million as the main news events.
"This is a joke that attracts people because it is something that we do not understand," Neal Baer, the main producer of ABC Designed Survivor, notes a minister who will be the president of the Congress building that was destroyed by the attack.
Nell Scovell, experienced by a comedy writer and book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a cab trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote for the Trumps.
Scovell asked me why.
The driver said, "When he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
Chaos has entertainment value.
In contrast to other TV programs, the news from Washington can determine how Roe v Wade goes, whether members of immigrant families can get to one another and how the world economy can.
Indifference is a luxury which only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond the obligations of a conscious citizen to look at a six-hour panel of experts who argues that Bob Woodward's source data is used for the book Fear, Paul Manafort's 15 000-dollar striking pilot coat (Washington Post says "drop out of suspicion") and Stormy Daniels' anatomy of Trump's imagination.
For example, I can never watch Super Mario again in the same way as before.
"What he does feel like a true TV program, because partly it is about giving the audience something every night," says the head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the Pantthalinaamo series of Brent Montgomery Trump's show and the daily change of ducts (NFLs, Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss any episodes, or you're falling off the carts.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, he was a wonderful sunny day at the northern coast of Kauai, but he couldn't go out because he looked at the MSNBC while he was laughing at CNN.
He could not depart from the programme where Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate's Ombudsman's committee and the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we made all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of the Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

There's a lot of money from outside to a tight middle-fighting.
It is not surprising that the 17th constituent district of Pennsylvania has encountered a real cash flow, because the reorganisation of the constituent elections makes two candidates already elected to fight from one place.
This recently re-established district of Pittsburg is a battle challenge for the Democrats Conor Lamb, who came from the second constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another elected candidate, the Republicans Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th constituent district of Pennsylvania, which is duplicated with the new 17 constituent district.
The regions were re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old constituent division favoured Republicans contrary to the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17 constituent district has launched a economic struggle in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The Lamb’s name came to be known in Pennsylvania after the spectacular elections of the 18th Congress election in Pennsylvania.
The place had been on the Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won 20% in the region.
Political commentators have made a great advance for the Democrats.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but retired from its intentions.
Diplomates have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already quoted the situation in Beijing and the mild counteract in Washington.
President Trump had a warm-minded meeting with President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners deported the Trump Organization Group.
Officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to invite the American diplomatic leaders back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of "shortly directions that Taiwan is no longer recognised," said Heather Nauert in his statement earlier this month.
However, the fines were considered only to El Salvador, which estimated to receive EUR 140 million of assistance from the United States in 2017 for drug control, as well as development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have severely hit the Central American State with a high rate of unemployment and mortality.
As internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high level meeting of security and economic prosperity. The corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in companies to prevent migrants from seeking to the United States.
In the mid-September, however, the high administrative officials made it clear that the meeting was to progress, and this effectively decided to make speculations about the possible punishment for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to give a scheduled meeting in the mid-October some kind of sign of importance for the administration of the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors mentioned returned in all silence to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new bad messages or punishment from Washington.
The reporter of the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the discussion with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues anonymously.
Their report reinforced the administration by an external analyst close to it, which also spoke in the protection of an anonymity condition.
History Teaching
The next inevitable step may be the report by Special Lawman Robert Mueller on the possible blocking of President Trump's justice, which is now a very heavy evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported in the directional investigation of whether the Trump campaign was secretly co-operating with Russia when Russia was involved in the US elections.
If power changes in the Congress, President Trump will be able to notice that he is accountable to it just when he is preparing to go back to his voters and possibly to be judged by his peers.
There are a lot of controversy here, and I don't mean to say that President Trump's loss would be inevitable, more than the loss of similar people in Europe.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and these solutions determine the length of this struggle.
In 1938 the German authorities would have been willing to fall from Hitler’s power if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the massacre of the years followed.
The course of history is circulating to such turning points where the unavoidable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now confronted with a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump separates Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for the Mueller case?
Mrs Rosenstein has been polished since the public was informed that she had proposed a secret speech of the President and considered the possible inability of the President to carry out his mission.
Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanugh's activities is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed to be a member of the Supreme Court, despite the credible allegations of sexual harassment and an unreasonable witness statement?
And above all, do we vote for a Congress in the mid-term elections, which considers President Trump responsible?
If we fail in these labors, our democracy will come into a long and dark winter.
But I believe we've succeeded in the lessons I've learned in Prague.

Ranger's Graham Dorrans optimistic to meet Rapid Vienna
Rangers will meet at home on Thursday, knowing that after the fair game played earlier in the same month against Villarreal in Spain, the Austrians would give the team a strong position to get to the European League G.
Knee injury prevented the middle field player Graham Dorans from getting into the field this season before the Villarreal 2-2-game, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a battleboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal has a good answer," the 31-year-old player states.
"We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and we brought a point with us.
Maybe we could have captured the victory at the end, but all the same game is probably a fair result.
They must have been better in the first half, and we got in the next half, and we were better.
On Thursday again, an important evening in the European League is ahead.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tough game because their results were good in the previous game. However, I believe that with the support of this team, we will be able to give everything we can and we will achieve a positive result.
Last year was really hard on my own injuries and changes in the team, but now it feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy it; the exercises are smooth.
I hope we can now be full of weight, leave the past season behind us and succeed."
Fear of pension savings takes women to sleep overnight
Although the researchers had a clear view of how they wanted themselves to be taken care of, few had talked to their loved ones.
Approximately half of the participants in the countrywide study reported that they would discuss the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only ten percent of the respondents reported that they talked to their children about it.
"Mens want family members to take care of them, but they do not speak of the subject," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them your hopes in time.
Talk to the professional and family about what and how to get help, as these issues are an important factor in determining costs.
Take financial advice into the debate: advice can also help to find a way to cover these costs.
Financial options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term health insurance, hybrid life insurance or self-employed insurance for covering these costs, if you are able to afford.
Work legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a healthcare representative to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and make sure that professionals are following your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also the drafting of a mandate for the treatment of your financial affairs.
It allows you to determine the trusted person to take care of the financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills will be paid if you are not able to take care of them yourself.
Also, remember small details: Imagine that your elderly parents would be on their way to the hospital because of a health situation.

Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami
At least 384 people have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that attacked the city on Friday in Indonesia.
Since communications are broken, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the northern region of the municipality of Donggala, which is closer to the surface center of the magnitude of the earthquake.
Over 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Key information about the request and Donggala on Sulawes Island:
The call is the capital of the central province of Sulawes, located on the western coast of the island of Sulawes, which was estimated at 379 800 in 2017.
The earthquake and the tsunami hit the city's 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala extends more than 300 km (180 miles) from the northwest coastline of the Sulawes island.
The municipality of Donggala is a administrative area under the province, with a population estimated at 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the most important industries in the economy of the central province of Sulawes, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important, but it has been focused on the opposite coast of the Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, there have been several tsunami attacks on the return and Donggala in the last 100 years.
In 1938 the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the active Pacific Ring of Fire and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the North Sumatra in the West Coast of the Province of Indonesia in Aceh caused a tsunami on December 26, which hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people on the Indian coasts. Over half of the victims were in the area of Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 Magnitude’s earthquake hit the island of the most invasive of Indonesia, Java, in the south, causing a tsunami that hit the island’s southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: 7.6 Magnitude’s earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 100 people died.
2010: 7.5 Magnitude’s earthquake struck together on Sumatran Mentawa Islands, causing a ten-metre high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The area of Acehin Pidie Jaya was destroyed and panicked by the surface of the earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami was born, but more than 100 people died when the buildings fell.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Lombok’s tourist island in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in isolation.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence
The oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and the vice presidential candidate, Track Palin, has been arrested for imprisonment.
According to the Alaskan police report on Saturday, Palin, 29 from Alaska Wasilla, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, prevention of domestic violence and opposition to arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from a female company when he tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
The palin's in prison for the Mat-Su Pretrial investigation and the guarantee amount is $500, reported by the TV channel KTUU.
According to the report, Palin arrived at the court on Saturday and responded to being "indefinitely innocent".

He is also charged with a class B violation of which can be condemned for a day of imprisonment and fines of $2,000.
Palin's not the first time accused of a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assault on his father Todd Palin.
At that time, Palin's mother called the police and informed me about the deportation.
The case is currently being dealt with in the Alaska veteran court.
In January 2016 Palin was accused of domestic violence involving the possession of a weapon under the influence of drugs.
Palin's girlfriend blamed Palin for hitting his face.
Veteran groups criticised Sarah Palin in 2016 for combining his son’s violent behaviour with traumatic stress disorder caused by the services performed in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia on Friday.
With its 7.5 magnitude, the earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are broken and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, just outside the central part of Sulawes.
Social media circulates videos from the moment of the earthquake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for beach festivals, please, in the city when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering a rare death penalty to the suspect of the NYC terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty in Sayfullo Saipoville, suspected of a terrorist attack on eight lives in New York City, a rare penalty that has not been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
According to the accusation of Saipov, 30, he was using Home Depot's rental car in a October hit on the West Side Highway in the southern part of Manhattan, where he was driving on foot travelers and bikers.
According to the report on the application for the death penalty for the Southern administration of New York, the death penalty is possible if the prosecutors are able to prove that Saipov killed eight of his victims "for purpose" and caused serious physical injuries.
According to the document of the Court of Justice, both of these accusations are possible to be sentenced to death.
After a few weeks of attack, the federal law charged Saipov with 22 points, including the charge of eight murders in support of a terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this crime in cases of organised crime. In addition, charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles included charges,
The attack required "destructive planning and preparation," the prosecutors noted and described the way in which Saipov performed his actions as "horrible, cruel and shameful".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Draken, Ariel Erlij, Herna Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", states the prosecution.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Since the previous decade, when the right of the Southern government of New York has given the death penalty, it has passed a decade.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but he was eventually sentenced to suffer life-long prison sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in New York in the case of a federal state in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed as sentenced for the Soviet spying two years earlier during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to legal documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance during the days and months following the attack.
He told the scientists he felt good about what he did, and the police told him.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he had received the inspiration after looking at the ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said that Saipov also wanted a ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to a 22-point charge to being innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense lawyers representing Saipov, said that the defence was "naturally disappointed" to the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to call for death penalty and not recognition and life-long without a chance to be released is a solution that only extends the trauma caused by the parties involved in these events," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked him not to be punished for death.
The Conservative Parliamentary Representative says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today in the protest against the Conservatives to "mobilize the civilian army."
The former President of Ukip said that politicians must know the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentary representatives suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, the Conservative Permanent Representative, said to the marshals in Birmingham that the UK would "be out already" if Farage was a Brexit secretary.
But May faces the discrepancy of its deeply divided lines in aligning the challenge of the Conservatives with the remainder, associated with a separate anti-brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep the Chequers Committee's proposal on the surface of the Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU's pressure.
The supporters call on him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the back attack and to force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihul that he wanted to "drop Chequers' proposal to go".
He proposed that Farage be involved and that it should be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd already be out," he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: "I am defending the Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He expressed his opposition to the EU in fact: "We did not fight the world wars to be subjected to.
We want to regulate our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone's idea that the public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British have changed their minds and would like to remain is a completely wrong claim."
The Conservative Brexit supporter, Andrea Jenkyns, also took part in the march and said to the journalists: "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, nor will it be in favour of the party's members and activists who are actually going to the streets and who are ultimately responsible for our success.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message to May, he added: "The Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their work while they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians need to experience pressure if they intend to fade the 2016 referendum decision.
This is about trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we're not accepting it."
When he spoke to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want politicians who are about to spin the brexi will have to feel pressure from you."
"We intend to mobilise the army of citizens in this country, which gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom is once again an independent, self-administrative and proud state."
In the meantime, the supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before a two-hour event in the city center.
A small group of activists spilled the "Tories Against Brext" signs this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the Conservatives about the security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"They are the people who say they are going to get the IT systems fixed and all technology for Canada plus plus plus, and the non-refractory border functions for free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a whole farce.
There's no good brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering a presidential candidate.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States says that he is seriously considering a presidential candidate after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusett Democrat spoke about his future in the town house in Massachusetts, West Saturday.
Warren, known as its repeated criticism of President Trump, will meet in November with Geoff Diehl of the Republicans, co-president of the Massachusetts campaign of Trump 2016.
Warren has been considered to be a potential candidate for the elections against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the voters after the beginning of the Trump season.
One of the participants asked whether Warren was going to try to be president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and it includes a woman at the highest position.
Arrest in the case of a LSU Sims shooting
Louisiana Baton Rouge Police announced on Saturday that he was arrested by someone suspected of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims dying on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police reported the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at the ET Communication.
The police had published a video of the shooting scene on Friday and asked for help identifying the man there.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus area early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims got shot in his head and died as a result," Commissioner Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted that he was in the hearings, holding a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson didn't make a resistance when he was arrested, and he was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 198-centre junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 in the last season, and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after team arrangements offer him the victory of Sebastian Vetti
When Valteri Battas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes' team arrangements play an important role in competition.
Battas received a good leave from the pole and left Hamilton almost his own fortune in defending his place in the first two rounds, calling Vetti's teammate.
Vettel went to the vault first and left Hamilton to drive a bunch of tails that should have solved the situation.
Mercedes followed the round later and returned to Vetti, but Hamilton passed by after a bit of contact and after the Ferrari driver’s move from the inner line, giving up his investment after his movement of two third translations.
Max Verstappen, the 21-year-old birthday of his 21-year-old birthday, started on the top of the carpets and was the seventh after the first round.
Afterwards, he was in charge of a large part of the competition in extending the exchange of tires in aimed at a rapid closure and taking a fourth place from Kimi Raikkös.
Eventually, he came to the shadow at the 44th round, but he was not able to increase the speed of the remaining eight circuits while taking Räikköne fourth place.
This was a difficult day, because Valteri was a great success throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman when he got by me.
The team has made an exceptional career to achieve a double victory," Hamilton said.
Very Bad Language of the Body
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that he did not leak the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, where this accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When speaking in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony in front of the Senate's Ombudsman's committee, but said that what was going on in the Senate was an indication of the people's "goodness, recklessness and dishonestness".
"This one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the past few days, when we saw the anger, the people who are angry, the wicked, the vicious and the dishonest," the president said.
"When we see publications and bedded things and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you all the years of this information?
Do you remember his answer... Did you spend the years in the document -- oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Wait a minute.
Did we... no, we didn't bleed," he added the senator in the morning.
In July, Feinstein received a letter depicting the accusations of Ford Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked in September, but Feinstein argued that the leak would have occurred from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't spill his story," Feinstein said to the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential according to his wishes."
But his ban was not acceptable to the President who commented on this at a Saturday's event: "Let me tell you that that was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, charged by three women of sexual harassment and thought that the Democrats would use the charges for their own benefit.
"They have decided to get back to power by whatever means.
You see that meanness and bride, they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and rule," Mediaite reports the President said.

Micronesia: Air Niugin says one person is missing after a plane crashed into the lagoon
Representatives of the airline that crashed in the Pacific Ocean now report that one person is missing, even though, earlier, all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
According to Air Niugin, after Saturday afternoon, it has not been able to fix one male passenger.
The airline announced that she was trying to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accidental investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to the questions regarding additional information on the lost passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane had hit into the water trying to land at Chuuk airport.
On Friday, the authorities reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people stayed in the hospital on Saturday and all were stable.
The cause of the crash and the precise course of the events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was driving over the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, the passengers were able to bind in a sinking machine in the water of the belt deep water to the emergency exits.
He said that the passenger staff had been panicked and screamed, and that he himself had a mild major injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors involved in the rescue operations of a nearby port platform carried people on a rubber boat before the plane dived into a deep water of about 30 metres (sea foot).
According to information from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crashes of airlines registered in Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugin has not joined the crash.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor finished the retreat where the man was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed hours as an expert in the field of informationnalytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the data stored on his cell phone in the night of the victim's death in Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers.
Rowlett reported that he had received the location of a number of mobile phones that showed that Tellis was contrary to his previous claims with Chambers the night that this was killed, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers at the same time as Tellis claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police interviewed Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said, "Tellis's lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks after he died.
According to the information recorded on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett noted that at some point after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, phone calls and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," Hale said.
The final speeches of the defence are designed to be launched on Sunday.
The judge said that he would expect the trial to proceed to the jury later on the same day.

They want to return to hip hop roots and make a conscious hip hop again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have been able to prove the new rise in Britain with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark guy?
New York nanny nurse sues a couple for a racist text message
A New Yorker nanny challenges a couple’s right to discriminating after accidentally receiving a text message from the mother of the child, in which it complains that she is "one more dark".
The couple denies being racist and parallels the challenge of "cuisine."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed its regret when the new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first day of work in 2016 and was white to her that this was dark.
"EIIIII, THANKS," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
But then he sent a message instead of his husband to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After recognising that mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who had been struggling in the New York Post, had dismissed Maurice, saying that their previous pass had been poorly handled by their African-American nanny nurse and had waited this time for the Philippines.
Maurice got paid for one day of work and was sent home by a cab.
Now Maurice is suing the couple's court to receive compensation for the divorce and wants to pay for $ 350 a day for the six-month period, which was originally washed him to live and work in a family, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do that," he said to the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has responded to racist claims, saying that the conclusion of Maurice's employment relationship was a reasoned solution because they could not rely on him when he was hurt.
"My wife sent him something he didn't mean to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told me at the Post interview.
"But would you leave your child in sight of someone you've been unfriendly to, though by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco paralleled the challenge of extortion and said that his wife had received a baby two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Can we start hunting the other one in a situation like this?
It's not very comfortable done," the investment bank circular added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the social media of the couple, including their behaviour and logic.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not identify the speaking bear
The Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born a little while after the book was approved, says in the letter: “It is difficult to live up to the position of a person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It's funny now that Paddington's huge popularity is known."
Assuming that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to the writing of children's adventures of a toy bear, would optimisticly reject his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the book publication seemed bitter because his father died in the previous year.
He described paddington as a very important family member and said his father was silently proud of the success he achieved.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he wasn't the one who was sobering at all," says his daughter.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; something you're proud of, even though it's not really your own achievement.
I think that's how he experienced Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation, he always gave the glory to Paddington to himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter had been commended after the plane landed at Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save his life for nothing.
"They called a little bit and told me the situation was really bad that he wasn't expected to survive," says Ednan-Laperouse.
Then they called and said that my daughter dies in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The medication that led the doctors to keep her heart running gradually got out of her body.
He had died a little earlier, and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was running out.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, dying of his daughter's loss, rose into a plane among other passengers who knew nothing about the trial he was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down, and the tears passed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt enormous compassion for Nadia.
That he needed my love and understanding now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter."
Dead women send cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and phone numbers that can be supported.
Davis's son, Tyler, had a depression when he was 13 years old and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want anyone's parents to have to experience the feelings I know every day," he said.
Davis, who lives in Lydney, 45, reports that his son was a promising cook with an infectious refreshment.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile would light the whole room."
But he quit his job before he died because he felt like he was in the dark.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother who had taken his life.
Davis says he's always afraid of the effects.
Davis created cards "to tell people that there are people who can go to talk even if it's a friend.
Don't be silenced. You have to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years, and he lost his partner after 15 years of coexistence, shortly after his mother was dead.
"He didn't say he was depressed or depressed or anything like that," said Humphreys.
"Another day before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behaviour.
He was on the ground on Christmas Day, and when the children opened their gifts, he didn't take eye contact with them or anything like it."
He notes Mark's death was a difficult trauma for them, but they have to survive forward: "It breaks the family.
It's gonna rip us apart.
But all we have to do is keep living and fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake at the start of his investigation by the FBI.
"I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted - timely and extensively - we could perhaps achieve a little unity," Flake said on Saturday, and added that he was afraid that the committee would "different" the dead end of its supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want a FBI investigation?
It's about timing.
The interim elections are only five weeks away, 6 November, and if the success of the Republicans is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want to choose for the highest justice of the country will become difficult.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called the senators for their support to Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI's report is drawn up?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting, a vote will be held.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes, where Vice President Mike Pence could blow the game out and strengthen his choice for the highest court.
North Korea's number of parasites falling in Kim's time.
According to the South Korean legislature, the number of persons displaced from North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-unin seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted South Korea's Ministry of Consolidation and said that there were some defects last year 127 in 2011, which occurred in 2 706.
According to Park, there are crucial factors for tightening border inspections between North Korea and China, as well as for the increase in prices for human smugglers.
There has been no public comment on Pyongyang.
For the majority of North Korea's leagues, eventually South Korea's citizenship will be offered.
Seoel states that over 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarized zone between Korea.
China treats librarians as illegal immigrants and not as refugees and most often returning them with violence.
Further technically, the relations between North Korea and South Korea in war have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang, and the discussions focused on the negotiating negotiation of the nuclear armor.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June, where President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of the United States met in Singapore and agreed on a general effort towards the nuclear invasion of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the imprisonment of sanctions after the meeting.
"There is no trust from the United States that our national security is not on a reliable basis, and in such circumstances we will in no case begin to unilaterally dismantle our equipment first," Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Fear calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
The minority director, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh as a "hysteric" candidate for the Supreme Court and said that this would be temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
Your fear commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved this way, she would be called "hysterical", Ferosi said that she reacted to Kavanaugh's witness statement before the Senate's Ombudsman's Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied the accusations that he would have sexually harassed Christine Blasay Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening talk, Kavanaugh was in the power of his feelings and sometimes he almost screamed and lost his speech ability to tell his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Committee's democratic members without calling the accusations against him "groteski and persecution against a planned person", organised by the Liberals who were upset by the Presidential election of Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Your fear said that he believes in Kavanaugh's witness statement that it is not capable of acting in the highest court because it showed him to be neutral to the Democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent in his statements and in the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," Fearos said.
Your fear was wondering if he was asked to file charges against Kavanaugh, if this choice was strengthened and if the Democrats had received a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's say this... if he doesn't tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified not only to the Supreme Court, nor to the court in which he is currently working," Pelosi responded.
Kavanaugh is currently working for the U.S. Federal petition court.
He added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned with the possible provisions of Kavanaugh regarding health reform or the Roe v Wade case, as Kavanaugh is known as a conservative legal user.
In the consultations on its confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the right time for a hysterical and partial person to be elected as a member of justice and we would expect to say that it is wonderful," said Pelosi.
Women have to get through everything.
This is a legitimate fire speech over the months and years of rage and cannot be kept without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything unusual, do you think?"
He continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in the leading position somewhere and who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her talk partner in a situation where she got angry and started to cry:"You may think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really mad."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are justified as a route to the extinction of rage, although they are generally misunderstanding fundamentally.
One of my most remarkable memories of my early work in a malely-owned office is when I once cried out of rage and a older woman - a cold-dreaming leader I was always a little scared - grabbed me from the neck and pulled me into the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and then they'll be happy because they've got your sorry mind."
Patricia Schroeder, then congressman of Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in this presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart caught a relationship outside marriage on a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, he was very frustrated Schroeder's idea that there was no reason why he would not try to be president himself.
"It was not a very well-considered decision," he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates and the least needed one more.
Someone called the situation "Summer and Seven Dwarf."
Since the campaign time was already long, he was behind the fund collection, and he said he wouldn't go to the race if he didn't get two million dollars.
It was a lost fight.
He felt that some of his supporters, who gave him a thousand dollars, gave him only 250 dollars.
"Do they think I'm getting something for a discount?" he thought.
When he held his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was in the power of his feelings - to his supporters of gratitude, to a system of frustration that made it so difficult to collect funds for the electoral work against the voters and not against the delegates, and to hate sexisms - that he was unable to speak.
"You could have thought I was going to get a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press's reactions.
"You could have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone's probably being beaten as a memorial.
'He wept.'
How trade war between the United States and China can benefit Beijing
The launch of the US-China trade war was an astonishing one, and even though the battle is all over, it can benefit Peking in the long term, experts say.
The first warning was given earlier this year by President Donald Trump of the United States to impose import duties on the main export items in China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, the most significant escalation occurred with new customs duties affecting import goods at USD 200 billion (150 billion) and effectively taxing half of all products imported from the PRC to the United States.
Peking has responded at the same level, lastly by fixing duties of five to ten per cent for American imports worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye-to-ey style, and it does not seem that the second largest economic power in the world would be shaking for a moment.
In order to bring Washington back, we should give up on our own demands, but the public worship for the United States would be far too humiliating to President Xi Jinping of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing inter-country dependence.
"The narrow political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, can create the conditions that begin the economic crash cycle in one of the countries, and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than those who have already understood so far," states Abigail Grace, a research assistant in Asia, Center for New American Security.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready for the return of refugees.
Syria says that he is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help with the rebuilding of the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
In speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country would improve.
"Your place is now more stable and safer because of the developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore the normal situation.
The circumstances now allow refugees to return on a voluntary basis to a country where they had to leave for terrorism and their daily lives and unilateral economic activities on their livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped from the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid in the country.
Mr Al-Moualem noted that the Syrian Government would be grateful to assist in the reconstruction of the destructed land.
However, he stressed that the government would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebels.
The European team confirmed Ryder Cup's victory in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup in 2018, defeating the United States team at the final points 16.5 against 10,5 Le Golf National field outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in succession in Europe, and it has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown on its own when its Danish Captain Thomas Bjørn team reached 14,5 points needed to win the United States.
The US star player Phil Mickelson had trouble almost all the time of the tournament, and he hit his launch in the water at the par-3 track on 16th round, giving a fight to Francesco Molinar.
In all the rounds in Italy Molinari, he became one of the four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the tournaments started in their present format in 1979.
The United States Jordan Spieth got out with the result of 5&4 European team against the lowest punished player in Denmark, Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dutin Johnson, the world's top player, lost 2 and 1 England Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight of the Ryder Cup golf veteran, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most win-win European of all times at 25.5 career points.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a heavy year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to have this victory.
It is a team, and I am glad that I could be helpful," said Garcia moved after the victory of the European team.
He moves the torch to his countryman Jon Rahm, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods in the 2&1 individual races that were played on Sunday.
"I feel great pride when I won Tiger Woods, and I grew up to admire him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his fights in France and now he has Ryder Cup career 13-21-3.
Strange statistics of one of the best players in all times who have won 14 great wins and only remain for Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the routes all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose game was high throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the United States team said after the failure of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We put pressure on the European team in the games this morning.
We put him in the hustle.
Respect Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We regroup, work with our American PGA and Ryder Cup committee, and we move forward.
These 12 guys are awesome, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I have to raise a hat.
We've met our winner."
