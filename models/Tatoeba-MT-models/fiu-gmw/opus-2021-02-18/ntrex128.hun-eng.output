The members of the Welsh National Assembly fear that they will find themselves at the Muppet Show.
Some members of the National Assembly were enraged by the proposal that their address would change to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, the representative of the Wales Parliament).
After the emergence, the National Assembly (Assembly) would rather be called the Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
Now Members of different political backgrounds are all afraid that they can be made laugh at the new title.
According to one of the working parties, his group is concerned that their new name will reflect the words “Twp” and “Pwp”.
Not for our Wales readers: in Wales, twp is one-headed, and pwp means cocoa.
According to one of the representatives of the Play Party, the entire group is “unsatisfactory” and therefore propose alternatives.
One of the Conservative Members said that his group “opened” to change his name, however, noted that only one jump from MWP was a "Muppet".
Here it is worth noting that the word "w" in Wales is similar to the "u" in Yorkshire, i.e. the "map".
The position of the National Assembly, which is responsible for drafting a legislative act leading to a change of name, is as follows: “The final decision on the titles for members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the Members.”
The Law of 2017 governing Wales’ governance allowed the Welsh National Assembly to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation proposed by the Wales Parliament and received broad support.
As regards the address of the Members, the Commission prefers the title of the Welsh Parliament Member (for the Welsh Parliament) and the shortening of the WMP, but the public consultation supported the alternative MWP.
The Members have new and new alternatives, but the agreement is quite difficult, which is a problem for the President of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to submit a legislative proposal for changes in name in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including on the disqualification of Members and Commission structures.
Contributors will be able to take their final position on their own address during the discussion of the draft law.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the name of the country
Citizens will vote on Sunday to change the name of the country to the "Night-Macedon Republic".
The purpose of the referendum is to put an end to a decades of debate with the neighbouring Greece, which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long said that the name of its northern neighbour is essentially a territorial requirement and has repeatedly objected to its request for EU and NATO.
President Ivanov himself objects to the referendum on name change and is not taking part in it.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is simply a compromise that must be committed to their accession to the EU and NATO.
Harlem churches in a difficult situation, the bells of St. Martin were silenced.
“ More, as I hear from older people, there was a bar and a church on every corner, ” says Adams.
- Not one of them today."
As you say, the disappearance of bars would be understandable.
“ People now go to company differently, ” he says.
– Bars are no longer the social living room where people go down every day."
As far as the churches are concerned, Adams is afraid that the sale of church property does not break the hopes of the leaders, “and in time they will return to the same place where they left. ”
In addition, the churches will be located in housing buildings that are also not helping the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white -” says, “and this will continue to delay the final closure of churches, as most of those who move into these apartments are unlikely to join the religious community.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a city of black people — the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martint a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of the church in the thirties,
which was then owned by a nearby black congregation.
The St. Martin church was taken by the black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the Reverend is known to be the Harlem shopping street, the 125th Street uses blacks or refuses to market black products against its business owners.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation, the bell game was built to order a community of Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s parish, proudly referred to the bells of the poor.
In July, according to the bell player, this bell game is “a cultural heritage, ”“ an unavoidable, historical instrument. ”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell game in the world that was spoken by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was crocheted to a greater bell game at the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather told me that St. Martin didn't sign up.
In St. Martin, in recent months, a complex situation has been compromised by the participation of architects and entrepreneurs, who have been part of the world leadership of the church, partly by the Bishop's office.
In July, the Governing Body of the Parochia, the Council of Churches, asked the Bishop Office in writing, arguing that the Office would ‘return the costs’ to the Council, while the Council did not participate in the selection of architects and entrepreneurs contracted by the Office.
Some members of the religious community complain about the lack of transparency in the office's home.
Shark attacked a 13-year-old Californian boy during crabfishing
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy during the crabfishing on the day of the crab season in California on Saturday.
The attack took place at the Beacon's Beach coast in Encinitas before 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told me on the KSWB TV channel in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving about a half an hour ago when he was alert about a boy calling for help. At that time, he spent more than a half an hour on his own to help him climb out of the water.
For the first time, Hammel thought that the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he realized that the boy was screaming: “He bit!
He bit me!"
“ His shoulder was scattered at his key bone, ” he described with Hammel what he saw when he came to the boy.
– I began to shout, so that everyone would go out of the water, "The shark is in the water," he added.
The boy was transported with an ambulance to the San Diego Children's Hospital, where he is currently being treated critically.
The tree of the shark attacking the boy is unknown.
As Captain Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier a shark was detected in the area, but it was found that it was not one of the species that were dangerous to the human.
Captain Giles also told me that the boy suffered traumatic damage on his upper body.
The authorities closed the coastal between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for the time of the investigation and for safety reasons for 48 hours.
According to Giles, more than 135 shark species occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
The Sainsbury's would expand on the British beauty market
The Sainsbury's expert would be able to compete with sales and large-scale peppers with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
In the middle of the fall in the sale of fashion and household articles, as part of the growing British beauty market of 2.8 billion pounds, the chain is carrying out testing of large-scale pepper stations throughout the country, and they will appear in new stores from next year.
The strengthening of the pipeline is due to the attempts made by shops in various ways to fill up the pre-existing platforms of televisions, microwave ovens and household articles.
Sainsbury's told us that he would double his offer to 3,000 products, including representatives of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are the first to offer.
But the former brands, L'Oreal, Maybelle and Burt's Bees are also located in a larger area on brand stands like those in Boots and similar stores.
The store chain also reboots the Boutique makeup family in which most of the products are now vegan – because nowadays more and more young customers are looking for them.
In addition, Fragrance Shop also tests its appearance in two Sainsbury's stores, one of which has been opened last week in Croydon in the southern part of London, while the other one opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham this year.
With the spread of online purchases and the transfer of food habits to small local trades, large-scale shops need to make greater efforts to attract customers.
According to Sainsbury's CEO, Mike Coupe, the offer will be increasingly similar to mixed trades, as the store chain is trying to competing competition with disco shops such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more and more services and other products outside foods.
Since he bought the two chains two years ago, in Sainsbury's hundreds of shops, he opened Argos classes and a few Habitat classes – this step also had a positive impact on food sales, so the acquisition is even more profitable.
The store chain has failed its previous attempt to sew beauty and medications.
At the beginning of the 2000s, Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots, but the debate on the distribution of incomes from pharmaceutical classes in the stores ended.
The new strategy was born three years ago after the Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business in 281 to Celesio, which operated the Lloyds patica chain, for 125 million pounds.
According to the store chain, Lloyds will play a part in the strategy and offer a wider pallet of luxury skin care products in four shops with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As the commercial director of Sainsbury's said, Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We want to make a more pleasant environment for our customers by transforming the appearance of our peppers.
In addition, we have recruited qualified staff who assist interested people with advice.
Our brands provide all demands, and the attractive environment and the conveniently accessible location provide a seducing power that increases the experience of buying to a new level."
Peter Jones “destructed” after Holly Willoughby stopped the 11 million-pound agreement
The Dragons’ Den star, Peter Jones, was “destructed” after Holly Willoughby’s television broadcaster has stopped from an important agreement of 11 million to focus on the new contracts concluded with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the Truly brand that sells clothes and accessories at home.
The two celebrities were compared with the Goop brand previously registered by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old programmer of This Morning announced that he was quitting on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby was thoroughly pulling the match with the Dragons’ Den star, Peter Jones, when she got out of their promising lifestyle distribution company at the last minute to focus on its very profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones “smashed ” when the TV rescuer was on Tuesday, at the headquarters of the Buckinghamshire business realm of Jones (Buckinghamshire) during a tense meeting, he announced that, because of his new contracts of a total value of 1,5 million pounds, there was no time left for their joint brand, Truly.
The two celebrities were compared with the Goop brand previously registered by Gwyneth Paltrow and expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million pounds.
While the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from the island to one of his holidays.
According to a source, “ Truly was the most important thing for Holly.
It was supposed to deal with this in the long term, and this would give you a chance to live in the next few decades.
Getting out was a total surprise for everyone.
I was surprised to hear what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to leaving.
In Marlow's office, the warehouse is full of goods to be sold."
According to the experts, the departure of this Morning programmer, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, could cost millions of the company from pillows and candles to clothing and to home wear, thanks to the magnificent amounts and possible slips.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-child programmer and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, ten years ago.
He launched Truly with Willoughby Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, took over the Presidency in March.
The two pairs are used to vacation together, and Jones has 40 percent share in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby will be the M&S product box and will take Ant McPartlin's place as the programme director of ITV I'm Celebrity.
A source close to Jones last night commented: “We don’t want to comment on [Jones]’ business.”
The words were loud, "we fell in love"
He was joking about what criticisms he would receive from the press for his statement, which some might be viewed as “unfavourable” and that he said so positively about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump let you so much?
– asked Trump in a funny "speakers" voice.
- I didn't let any of it."
As you noted, Kim would like to meet for the second time after Trump welcomed the first trial in Singapore as a huge step towards North Korea's nuclear defensive.
However, the nuclear disarmament negotiations have been frustrated.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, Ri Jongho, representing North Korea, informed the United Nations General Assembly that, as your country sees, the United States will not have a “requisite response” to the early weapons of North Korea.
Instead, the United States continues to maintain sanctions for pressure.
Trump was more optimistic than that in a campaign speech.
“ Things are going great with North Korea, ” he said.
- We were supposed to have a war with them.
Millions of people would have lost there.
But now we have a very good relationship."
As he said, his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have set out positive results – the completion of the missiles, the release of the hostages and the return of the American soldiers.
He also explained why he speaks about his relationship with Kim in such a unusual way.
“It's not hard to act alive, but now there's no ten thousand people out there trying to get in here, but only about two hundred are standing in front of me," said Trump, pointing to the group before him.
In Indonesia, there are hundreds of dead Cunamis and earthquakes that turn up the island.
Indonesia has also rejected the help of international aid organisations after the Lamboki earthquake.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to be installed, no disaster at national level was reported, which would be a prerequisite for the arrival of international assistance.
“In a number of cases, it has been very clear to say that they do not require international assistance, so we have a little difficult situation” said Sumbung.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on compiling a Paluto emergency team, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will actually be able to participate in the rescues at the scene.
Sutopo, a spokesman of the National Defence Agency, is also currently carrying out an assessment of the situation in question to see whether the involvement of international aid organisations is necessary.
Despite the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared against the destructive power of nature.
Although there were snacks in the Aceh province, this is not common in other coastal areas.
The same was true, the apparent lack of the cunami signal siren system in Paluman also contributed to the emergence of a disaster requiring human life.
Transport can be difficult even in the best time between the Indonesian islands.
Logistics is even more problematic during natural disasters.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but at least three more days before he reaches the disasterd zone.
Joko Widodo has placed the development of the chopped infrastructure of Indonesia at the centre of his electoral campaign and did not save the costs in road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government now faces budgetary shortcomings before the elections next year.
In addition, the president must face the continual tensions in Indonesia, because the majority of Muslims began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to be relocated because of the riots of Christian and Muslim gangs, with roasters, arrows and arrows, and other sparkling weapons on the streets.

The Cromwell statue in Parliament is the latest victim of the history-rewriting fever
The exile of the statue might be a poetic justice for Cromwell and his fanatic puritean followers to destroy the Taliban's cultural and religious heritage.
According to the Cromwell Society, however, Crick's proposal for "crazy" is a "test for the rewriting of history".
According to the President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, “it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s statue, before Westminster’s palace, would eventually become a target during the current discussions on the removal of statues.
During the British Civil War, Cromwell didn't order and execute the image destruction.
So maybe another Cromwell could be sacrificed for Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fascinating Cromwell's fascination reflects the opinion of the 19th century, and makes it a historical figure that has to be celebrated even nowadays."
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is perhaps less than at the end of the 19th century, but a lot of people consider it to be the defender of external pressure, which, of course, was the monarchy in his case.
The fact that this picture is really accurate continues to be subject to a historic debate.
However, it is certainly certain that this conflict in the middle of the 17th century had an impact on the further development of our nation's destiny, and Cromwell is an identifyable person who represents one side of this conflict.
And it is worth celebrating and remembering the achievements of the Lord's protector."
Murdered pig wounded to death by a Chinese master
Local press reports that a pig attacked and wounded a farmer on a market in the southwest of China.
His last name was found on the man who was identified as Yuan by blood, with a ripped arm alongside the pig on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Gujzhou, reported the case on Sunday.
A pig breeding farm is prepared to inject pigs in a breed on 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining, in the province of Csinghai, China.
The man traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Jinnn to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, he found his cousin's body and discovered that his door was open with the next pig.
He told me that the mouth of the giant nipple in the pig was bloody.
According to the report, the expert's investigation has found that the farmer is actually a 250 kilos of pigs to death.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody, and they were scattered, ” said Guiyang Evening News only by a relative named Wu as her last name.
According to the security cameras, Yuan went to the pig at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that others would no longer be damaged while the police were investigating the traces at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are currently discussing compensation for the death of a man.
Although it doesn’t happen often, there have been reports of a case before when pigs attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their Massachusetts farm and caused life-threatening damage to the man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound pig in Wales pushed a farmer to the tractor until the man's wife had been alerted.
In 2012, after an oregonian farmer was occupied by its own pigs, a farmer in Manitoba talked about the CBC News show that pigs generally do not tend to attack, but they can become aggressive from the taste of blood.
“They're big players.
Like little kids, they're very interesting... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them respect," he said.

Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
On six television channels, over 20 million audiences were interested in the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accusing him of rape in the eighties, Christine Blasay Ford.
In the meantime, the political patrol situation has not been resolved, and broadcasters had to break the normal broadcast for the last-minute Friday screw: Senator Jeff Flake managed to get the FBI a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that he was 100% sure that he was at a high school party at Kavanaugh's time and tried to pull him off.
In Kavanaugh's passionate witness, he said he was 100% sure this didn't happen.
The statements were probably seen by more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday.
Nielsen calculated with the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC viewers.
Other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, intermediating the hearing were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is difficult to measure the number of people who watch the show at work.
For the purpose of the comparison, so many viewers are used to be a football player or an Oscar dealer.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, who has recruited experts to support the appointment of Kavanaugh from all channels, had the highest, on average 5,69 million viewers during the whole day hearing.
Second place ABC stands with 3.26 million audiences.
CBS was viewed by 3,1, NBC 2,94, MSNBC 2,89 and CNN by 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's report.
Interest was not reduced after the hearing.
The main role of the Friday drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued a statement that Senator Kavanaugh would take his vase, on Friday morning, the CNN and CBS show were visible as the loud crowd of protesters receives when he tries to the meeting of the court committee on the lift.
He was eyewitnessed for minutes while the crowd smothered and CNN broadcasted the scene lively.
“I stand here in front of you, ” said a woman to the senator.
– Do you really think Kavanaugh's telling the truth in front of the country's publicity?"
Others shouted: “It is in your power to do what many women do not. ”
Flake just said that his office issued a statement, and then, before the elevator's door was closed, he added that he would share what he said at the Commission hearing.
The cable and broadcasting channels were then visible live hours later, as the committee voted on whether Kavanaugh's nomination was presented to the full Senate for voting.
Flake said, however, that he would only be willing to do this if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate next week, as the democrats in the minority have urged it.
Flake's conversation with his friend Chris Coons Democratic Senator has been convinced about the need for this.
Flake decided to talk to Coons and later other senators.
With Flake's decision, it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans will not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump launched a FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, is charged with political gambling against Brexit's opponents.

In another interview directly alongside May’s interview, May’s former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacks May’s so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that it is the suspicion of treating the customs between Great Britain and the EU, “with absolute absurd”.

Police conspired with catalone separatists at the anniversary of the independence reference
On Saturday, six men were arrested in Barcelona after the independence protesters hit the police and thousands of them joined rival protests on the first anniversary of the Catholic break-up referendum.
A group of terroric separatists was thrown with eggs and paint powder by the retarding policemen, so the other time the streets filled with tourists were covered with a string of dust.

The "We Don't Forget, We Don't Forsake" Slogist Groupings of Independence Groups and Unit Party Demonstrators who are behind the "Live Spain".
According to the local press, 14 people have been killed with minor injuries during the protests.
In the region of independence, the tension continues to decline, following the referendum of 1 October, which was celebrated by the Catalan separatists, which was considered illegal.
The electorate voted with a huge majority, although the participation rate was rather low, because most of the Unionists had boiked the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year when the police tried to stop voting in the polling areas with aggressive collisions.
The independence groups were on the street all night on Friday to prevent national police demonstrations.
Although not prevented, the demonstration was ultimately not on the normal route.
According to the 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in separatist protests, there is no chance to win the independence of Katalonien.
“ Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents throwing joy in voting for, but now our case has been plagued," he said.
Although at the regional elections last December, a major victory has been achieved, even if it is a narrow victory, it is difficult for the independent parties in Catalan to maintain their impetus this year after many of their most well-known leaders have been freed from exile or are waiting for the court to judge for their role in the organisation of the referendum and in the subsequent exclaiming of independence.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car manufacturer with a phone recording of the police demonstration, the conflict was fired by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense," he says.
One of the Katalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who has been waiting for the negotiations since last year to be arrested, announced that the elections to the European Parliament would take place next year.
"I can at least reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression represented by the Spanish Government if I participate as a candidate in European elections," she said.
Londonderry: The police arrested three men who drove their car into a house
The police arrested a 33-year-old man, 34-year-old, and a 39-year-old, who drove their cars into a house several times in Londonderry.
The case occurred at the Ballynagard Crescent about 7:30 in the UK summer time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
They may even shoot the car at a certain moment.
With Menga's goal, he beat Livingston's Rangers team to 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal to secure the Livingston victory
Livingston, fresh in the first class, gave the Rangers team a big surprise by bringing Steven Gerrard to his second defeat, who has been active as the coach of the ibrox club since 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal reported the real difference, because Gary Holt's team got into a dead race with the Hibernian team in the second place.
So the Gerrards continued to stay without a foreign victory in the current season of the Scottish League, and next Sunday they are facing the first-position Hearts team, with eight points behind.
However, first, there's still a match for Rangers on Thursday at the European League against Rapid Vienna.
In the meantime, Livingston has increased its divisional incontroversial series to six wins, which means that the Kenny Miller has not yet gotten out with the team last month.
Livingston has missed a number of situations against an inaccurate guest team.
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before one goal of the game, because with their attack game, there were little problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the protection of the opponent, but he was too far away from the attack, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt proved to be broad after he slipped in to reach Craig Halket's crossed ball before the goal line.
The home team allowed Rangers to play their own game, as they were sure that they could disturb the guests in the fixed toys.
Destiny Gol was born from a situation like this.
Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a hole in the defense, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of this from the middle of sixteen.
At this stage of the game, Rangers was driven by balls, but domestic protection still proved to be unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's gate was scarcely in danger.
This trend continued in the second half of the game, except for one situation when Kelly had to defend Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was off the Rangers Gate, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow lost the gate from another free kick at Livingston.
The Cruise Balls continued to arrive at Livingston Sixteenth, but the defenses were retired every time. The attack team did not receive two criminals: one Halket is the entry against Glenn Middleton as a replacement player, and the other for handwriting.
"Fenomenal" game from Livingston – game analysis
Tony Macaroni from Arena is a reporter from Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland.
Livingston provided a phenomenal performance, and he set down the beards.
Players were one-to-one spectacular, and in a row, they've gone over the expectations.
The team's members and gambling style have barely changed since they returned to the front line, but Holt's efforts deserve great appreciation since the coach arrived.
Several players brought the most excellent form.
The halkett team commander made a gigantic man with an excellently organized defense, and Menga was good for Connor Goldson and Joe Worral.
The Rangers didn't play without the idea.
As well as they are at times under Gerrard's leadership, they are now unable to bring that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – and they only managed to break the domestic protection once, so Rangers needs to get together quickly because they slipped back to the middle of the field.
Erdořan found a mixed reception in Köln
The morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany was characterised by a pleasant mood and enjoyment on Saturday (September 29th) in Berlin.
This was the last day of his visit to Germany, which distributed Erdořan, aimed at improving the relationship between NATO Member States.
The relationship between the two countries has worsened because of issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdoñan then traveled to Köln for a newly built, huge mosque opening celebration.
The town of Köln is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
On security grounds, the police banned the gathering of the 25 000 people before the mosque, but many of the president's supporters appeared to see the Turkish Head of State.
In addition, hundreds of protesters, including several Kurds, have expressed their refusal to accept Erdoñan's policy and the German government's decision to take the head of State.
The two conflicting protests are an excellent example of the President's policy-sharing role, which is celebrated by some Turkish German citizens as a hero, while others see autocracy in it.
Road accident in Deptford: a bike car crashed and lost his life
He lost his life when he hit a car in London.
The crash was at the crossing of the high traffic road in Deptford in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 in local time.
The driver of the passenger car stopped, and the paramedics tried to help the bike, but he lost his life at the scene.
The impact was only a few months after another bike hitting the Childers Street, just one mile away from the Saturday accident scene.
According to the London Police Statement, the police continue to work to determine the male identity to inform the relatives.
As a result of the investigation, road closures and bus carriages make transport difficult, and the authorities advise cars to avoid the surroundings.
Long Lartin Prison: six prisoners were injured during a disturbance
Six prison guards were injured in a rigorously guarded man's prison in trouble, reported by the prison board.
The disturbances began at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday morning at the Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire, and they were not prevented.
In order to address the situation, the competent authorities have commanded the special group called “Tornado” on the site. Eight prisoners are involved in disruption, which have been put back into a building wing.
The members of the specialised team suffered only minor head injurys that were managed to be carried out at the scene.
Statement by the clergyman of the sanctioning organisation: “A specially trained prison guard team handles the situation in the Long Lartin Penitentiary.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injury.
We don't tolerate violence at any level in our prisons, we're going to transfer the responsible ones to the police, and they can expect further imprisonment."
The man in Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners in custody, among whom the most dangerous criminals in the country can be found.
In June, the prison director was reported to be hospitalized after attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the special forces also needed help to defeat a serious confusion during which the prisoners attacked the prison staff with billiard balls.
Rosa hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with a sudden flood (the situation of the areas affected by drought can improve)
Arizona is rarely reached by tropical depression, but it is expected that this is what the state will have to assume at the beginning of next week when the hurricane remains of Rosa are swept through the desert southwest, drasticly increasing the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already assigned flooding preparations from Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and to the south-eastern areas of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The hurricane Rosa is predicted to pass straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring large rains.
The Phonexi meteorological service published the following message on Twitter: “Since 1950, in the form of a tropical storm or depression within the 200 miles of Phonenix!
The hurricane of Katrina (1967) approached the border of AZ 40 miles."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict a rainfall of 50 to 100 mm, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other parts of the southwest desert areas (middle areas of the group, Great pool, etc.) a rainfall of between 25 and 50 mm can be calculated, but 100 mm may fall in some places.
The rain from Rosa can bring relief to areas not threatened with lightning waters, as the region is currently under severe drought.
Despite the serious threat of floods, some rainings can have a beneficial impact on the southwestern landscapes in the town.
“American Drought Watch Service says that more than 40% of Arizona territory is affected by a minimum extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category,” states theweather.com report.
Rosa's hurricane will first reach the shore on the sub-California of Mexico.
It continues to be hurricane, and by bringing a wind of 137 km/h on Sunday morning, it will travel about 600 km south of Punta Eugene, Mexico, and it will take approximately 19 km/h north.
The storm in the Pacific meets colder flows and will lose its strength.
It is therefore expected that the coasts of Mexico will be reached again as a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening hours.
In certain areas of Mexico, there can be a frequent rainfall, which will significantly increase the chance of flooding.
“Dreams can, on average, result in a rainfall of between 70 and 150 mm from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, where there may be a rainfall of 250 mm,” says theweather.com report.
Rosa then goes northward through Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches Arizona’s border on Tuesday, early morning hours, in the form of tropical depression, so that she can go through Arizona on Tuesday night to the southern areas of Utah.
“The greatest threat posed by Rosa and its remains in Lower California, Northwest Sonora and the Southwestern desert areas of the United States, ” said the National Hurricane Center.
Rainings are expected to cause life-threatening lightning waters and hordes flows in desert areas and in mountain areas from landings.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four persons were arrested for suspected murder attempts.
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of a murder attempt after a 16-year-old young man was found with stabbed wounds in Somerset.

The boy was immediately transported to the hospital, and his condition was “stabil. ”
According to the police statement, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old men were arrested during the night in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.

Trump said Kavanaugh had to “dirness and wrath of the Democratic Party”
“Who votes to Judge Kavanaugh votes against the ruthless and disgusting tactics of the Democratic Party”, said Trump at the meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, Kavanaugh was nominated, the Democratic Party had to “people and wrath. ”
On Thursday Kavanaugh testified before the Congress, where she strongly and passionately denyed Christine Blasay Ford’s claim that the man had committed sexual violence over decades earlier when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing and stood up with his previous claims.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans had seen with their own eyes ” the day Kavanaugh’s brilliant and fearless character.
“Works absent with one of the finest legal professionals of our age alongside Judge Kavanaugh, who have a maculatable public service experience” said Trump to his supporters in West Virginia.
The president was pointing to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Only five weeks apart from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not going on personally, but I'm basically leaving," he said.
- That's why I'm going anywhere to support the best candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are following the tactics of “defence and obstruction. ”
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, said a leading Republican advisor to CNN.
Hundreds of people died in an earthquake in Indonesia, the number of deaths is rising
Many people were lost, and at least 384 people lost their lives when the gigantic waves reached the coast. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and escape on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, by the local authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival held on Friday in the town of Palu, when the waves of nearly six feet (18 feet) reached the coast at the fall, many were scattered, and all was destroyed in their way.
The fountain was triggered by an earthquake of 7.5 strength.
“When the fountain observation was voiced yesterday, the people just stayed on the beach, did not escape immediately, so the waves became the victim,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the Indonesian disaster response agency (BNPB) at the Japanese press conference.
“The fountain didn’t come just by itself, cars, stairs, houses, and everything else he did with himself from the beach,” said Nugroho, and then adds that the Cunami traveled at 800 km/h in the open sea before reaching the beach.
There were those who climbed from the price to the top of the trees and escaped, he said.
About 16 700 people have been evacuated to 24 shelters, please.
Air recordings published by the Agency on the disaster show a number of demolitioned buildings and business premises, a number of bridges that have broken down and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, further aftermaths shaken the city of the beach.
The earthquakes could be perceived in an area of the size of which some 2.4 million people live.
According to the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT), approximately 200 times more energy was released during the Friday earthquake than the nuclear bomb dumped to Hirosima in World War II.
The Agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay and that the resulting geographical characteristics could strengthen the impact of the fountain.
According to Nugroho, thousands of houses in the catastrophe were destroyed and hospitals, shopping centres and hotels collapsed.
Several victims were found among the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, and then added that the number of injured persons has been 540, and that there are 29 more.
According to Nugroho's statement, the number of injured persons and the damage caused could be even higher in the coastal area (190 miles) from Palu, the area called Donggala, as it was closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications “is completely paralyzed, cannot be obtained from information” from Donggala, said Nugroho.
“ More than 300 000 people live there” says the Red Cross Communication, which also announced that the organization’s professionals and volunteers are already on their way to the area affected by the disaster.
"The situation is already tragic, but it can be much worse," they added.
On Saturday, the Agency received a number of criticisms about not informing the population of the Palut sniper, but according to the management, the waves have already reached the coast as the alarm was issued.
On one of the public sites, an amateur recordings shows a man who seeks to warn people on the streets with desperate screams from the upper floor of a building.
Within a few minutes, a huge water wall will hit the beach, moving cars and buildings with you.
The Reuters News Agency hasn't yet been able to prove the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and the fountain have caused an outlet of power, thereby impeding communication in the area of Palu, so that the authorities can harder coordinate rescue work.
The Army sent an emergency shipment with freight aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the authorities believe that the evacuated population will still need food and other basic needs articles.
The airport of the city was opened only to facilitate assistance work and is closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres set up by Ava.
The number of victims of the Indonesian fountain exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala to Palu, where the employees found shelter under the tent carpets set at the office’s courtyard, but on their journey they met with horrific marks of destruction, said Doseba.
“ They said that there were many ruined houses, ” he added.
- It's really bad."
While the aid teams saw the preparation of disaster management work, some complained that foreign specialists with great experience in this area were unable to travel to Palura.
Indonesian legislation provides that aid, aid delivery and personnel from all overseas can only be allowed to enter the territory of the country if the place of the disaster is declared a disaster at national level.
This hasn't happened until then.
“The case is still being treated as a state disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
– Once the government acknowledges that it is indeed a national disaster, we can allow international aid services, but no notification has been made yet."
On the second night of Friday's crash and escape, please, the friends and family of the missing ones continued to hope that they would be among those who were loved to be in the dark mood of reports about natural disasters.
On Saturday, during the rescue work, they pulled a little boy out of the channel.
On Sunday, the workers managed to release a woman who had been found under the ruins for two days along with the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the national skull parachute team in Indonesia, prepared two competitors of the missing sky parachutes for Asian Games this time in Indonesia.
Other students, apart from the missing, were found in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“ As a skull parachute in the water, what happened is a great burden on me, ” he said.
Gendon recalled that when the news of the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel began spreading between the parachute parachutes, for hours, he desperately tried to reach the racers at WhatsApp who just attended the beach festival, please.
However, instead of two blue pipes, only one grey pipe appeared.
“Congratulations, this means that the messages could no longer be delivered, ” he said.
26 750 dollars were abducted during downloading a bank machine at the Newport on the Leva shopping center
Friday morning, the thieves robbed $26.750 from a colleague from Brink's who just spent a ATM cash in the Newport on the Levee shopping center, in a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the money transport car just evacuated a bank automation at the entertainment center, and he was planning to fill it with more banknotes, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the communication.
A man ‘ approached Brink’s employees from behind, ’ while he was busy with his work and stole one of the prepared money bags.
The witnesses have seen several suspected offenders fleeing the scene, but the police statement does not contain the exact number of suspects.
Anyone who can provide information on the identity of the perpetrators can contact the Newport police at phone number 859-292-33680.
Kanye West: the name of the rapper has changed to Ye
Kanye West, the rapper's name is Ye from now on.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday, with the message: “The creature who was formerly called Kanye West.”
The 41 - year - old West has been called Ye nicknames for some time, and this was the title of the eighth album published in June.
The change of name was announced before Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new Yandhi album.
In the show, Ariana Grande is taking over, who, referring to “emotional reasons,” canceled the performance, said the programme producer.
The new name is not only a shortening of the current name of the rapper – the previous expressions show that West has a religious significance.
“I know that the word ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible means ‘he’,” said West earlier when he spoke to Big Boy about his album’s address with a radio broadcaster.
- So I'm you and I are and we're all one.
The Kanye means that it's the only one, and it's the Ye that just symbolizes the good in us, the bad, the confusion, everything.
"The album rather reflects who we really are."
Ye is one of the famous rappers who change their names with love.
Sean Combs, for example, ran as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he would now prefer Love and Brother Love.
West's former composer, JAY-Z, also has repeatedly altered his name to be written in a single, bundle, maybe in a large letter.
The Mexican president promised not to take the army against civilians.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexican president, promised that he would never take the fight against civilians with regard to the coming 50th anniversary of the blood bathing tuitions.
López Obrador, on Saturday, on the Tlateolco area, promised that “he would never use the army to repress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, military teams opened fires for participants in a peaceful demonstration, causing the death of about 300 people, when the left-hand student movements showed signs of reinforcement in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help young people in Mexico – to grant students a monthly financial allowance and to establish additional free public universities.
He argued that the lack of unemployment and education is the two main factors that lead young people to the arms of criminal organisations.
The US should double the financing framework for MI solutions
As China becomes more active in research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the support for such research, declared Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of solutions using artificial intelligence, who used Google, Microsoft and Apple earlier.
This was said after the US government made notifications of artificial intelligence, despite the lack of official MI strategy in the USA.
In the meantime, China also announced its related plans: the country's aim is to become the world's first MI developer by 2030.
"Dubling the cost framework for MI research would be an appropriate beginning, since all other countries are significantly behind the US and the next breakthrough in the MI area is pending," said Lee.
Duplication of research aid could also double the chance that the United States would take the next major step in the field of artificial intelligence, said in the interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (the superpowers of artificial intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was published this month in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of the Sinovision Ventures company. The company has invested in one of the most important companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on a MI system that managed to defeat the best American Othello player, and later he was a leading member of Microsoft Research and chairman of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of the technological competitions previously announced by the US government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next event would be organised, because it would be possible to find new future figures.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain the necessary state aid for their research, said Lee.
He added: “China does not oxygen the scientific leadership, but the big companies.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have also signed a number of major college skulls to work in the MI area.
According to Lee, the amendment of immigration policy could also help the US's efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that you should automatically receive a green card for those who have a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council announced its plan for the development of artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
China's national natural science base provides similar support to the staff of the academic institutions, as the US National Science Fund (NSF) and other government organisations share money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, explained by Lee.
This year, the Ministry of Defence created the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center MI, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, the DARPA invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next,
NSF currently spends 100 million dollars a year in support of MI research.
In the meantime, the law of the United States of America, which planned the establishment of a National Security MI committee, has not taken further steps in the interests of the case for months.
In Macedonia a referendum on changing the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted for a referendum on Sunday to change the name of the country as "North Macedonian Republic", with this step to resolve a disagreement with Greece over a decades, which prevented the acceptance of the EU and NATO membership request.
Greece, one of its provinces is Macedonian, argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates that it is demanding for a similar Greek area, and has so far taken the NATO and EU membership of the country.
In June, the two governments negotiated a new name of the State, but according to the national emotional opponents, the name change would mostly undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavian population of Macedonia.
President Ivanov stated that he would not take part in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it became doubtful whether the 50% participation required for the current referendum would be available.
The question on the voting papers is as follows: "Do you promote the NATO and EU membership of the country and accept the agreement with Greece?".
With Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, who supports the name change, they argue that this price is worth paying to ensure that Macedonia, as one of the rising countries in Yugoslavia, is a chance of EU and NATO membership.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it would be a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skop.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, enough parliamentary members have declared that they feel obligated to the outcome of the vote.
The name change requires two-thirds of majority in Parliament.
According to the State Election Committee, no irregularities have been reported by 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate reached only 16% until this point. This value was 34% at the 2016 parliamentary elections (to which 66% of the registered voters participated).
"I came to vote for my children because we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in Skopia, the capital city.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, took their vote in Strumica, a referendum on 30 September 2018, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage and chairs and tents for the boycotts before the parliament building.
"We also support the NATO and EU membership of the country, but we want to join us with a proud, lifted head and not through the actor," said Kavadarkov.
– We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia as part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership could be accounted for by investments in Macedonia, which the country with unemployment above 20% needs.
"I think that the majority will support our case, because over 80% of the population in the country support fundamentally the EU and NATO membership," said Zaev, after voting.
He also added that the "yes" vote means "insurance of the future of the country".
According to the results of the survey published last Monday by the PIC in Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters are expected to take part in the referendum, which is lower than the required level of participation.
Another survey carried out by the Macedón Telma TV shows a 57% participation rate on Sunday.
For those who want to go to the vote, 70% of them said that they're going to have a yes.
In order to ensure that the referendum is valid, the participation rate should be more than 50 % by at least one vote.
The invalidity of the referendum would be the first serious strike on the western government that took power in May of last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, the gamer of Manchester City, gets the full brighton protection
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling dealt thoroughly with Brighton's protection, so Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in England.
Aguero's gotten a goal in 65 minutes, like it's the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentin battle was the first step of the attack in the middle of the field that received a pass, and
Between the three guards in Brighton, he escaped to the open field.
That's when four green bears took Aguero around.
He took a guard and then ran to the 16th of Brighton.
And then, left-handed to Sterling that showed up there.
The English warrior has given the ball back to Aguero, who completed the action right on the right side of the gate of the Brighton nightman Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has problems with his legs,” said Pep Guardiola, the manager of Manchester City.
– We agreed you could play 55, up to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
Fortunately, that's when he got the goal."
The initial advantage of Sterling's action has been achieved by the Blues at the British championship.
The gol was born in 29 minutes when it was
Aguero, who's in the area of the Brightonians, has a great pastor.
He set up a beautiful crossball to Leroy Sane on the left edge.
Sane played with the ball for a while before he started Sterling for a long time.
For the battle of the blues, he was just able to sneak the ball into the gate before he slipped outside the baseline.
City plays with Hoffenheim's team in the Champions League on Tuesday 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make the Rockies harder.
Since the Nationals team missed the opportunity to enter the post season, there was no reason for them to be persuaded.
However, the always competing spirit Scherzer can hardly wait to stand on Sundays against Colorado Rockies, but only if the opponent's team still has a chance to play the game. Rockies is a game advantage for Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Baseball League.
The Rockies at least secured a comforting place with the victory of the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but their first division address is still waiting for you.
“Even though we have no chance, we can stand up against them, in Denver the mood of the audience and the other team is expected to be on the top of the whole year.
Of course I'm in the mood to get into the field like this!"
The Nationals team still has to choose the starter for Sunday, but the news is that in this situation, Scherzer will be the drummer.
Scherzer, who was in a throwing training on Thursday, will have his 34th starting drop on Sunday, which is usually his resting day.
The right-handed gamer in Washington consists of 18-7 this season, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3.
Trump is campaigning in Western Virginia
The president was also inclined to refer to the situation surrounding the Supreme Judge, Brett Kavanaugh, when he talked about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“ Everything we've done so far is at stake in November.
We're only five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the greats, the greats – I do not go personally, but I'm actually leaving, so I'm going everywhere to support the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “Everyone can see what these terrible radical democratic groups do with their own eyes.
They are truly determined, and they are able to take any means to restore power, to be seen as evil and naughty.
It doesn't matter who's hurting who they're going to kill in order to have control in their hands, they have power, that's what they want, control, and power, but we don't leave ourselves."
According to the president, the Democrats are introducing "resistance and impediment".
“May it have been seen in the last four days,” he said, “wrong and angry and naughty and liar ” by calling the Democrats.
According to his name, he mentioned Senator Feinstein of the Democratic Republic, a member of the Senate's Committee on Justice Affairs, for which he declared a loud denial of the gathered mass.
“Do you remember what he answered?
You leaked the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait, all this with a very bad body language, that was the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The Working Party no longer supports diversity.
You don't tolerate those who are free to say what you think
I wasn't surprised at all when the activists of the Momentum decided on my censorship.
After all, I am only the last in a long line of colleagues who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have said what we think.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has been treated similarly for being unreasonable against antisemitism.
In my case, the censor didn't like that I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Moreover, the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which are ironically the issues Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
On the invitation to the Worker Party meeting held in Nottingham East on Friday, the invitation was that they wanted a “inclusive and productive meeting”.
For the most part of my eight years as local representative of the Working Party, these Friday evening meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, however, the voice has changed today, and the promise of a "retroduced, more polite" policy has come to an end if it has ever occurred.
It is increasingly noticeable that the Working Party does not tolerate different views and that all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party's management.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and my colleagues who, I thought, were similar to our political attitude, have been waiting for more and more times in recent times to turn my back on my individual opinions and to take a position on things that I would never agree with, be on national security issues or on a single European market.
After all my public speeches, regardless of what I actually said, they start to burst on social sites, they demand my redemption, criticise the policy that leads to the centre, and tell me that I should not be a member of the Working Party.
It's not just me.
In fact, I know that I am more lucky than many of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me tend to politics in general.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my politician colleagues who have to stand up with sexist and racist attacks every day, but they don't run.
The most disappointing aspect of today's policy is that such a level of attacks have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn spoke last week about the need for the Working Party to support the culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we have renounced diversity, and with all the "insecure" initiatives and all the changes to the electoral rules, there is a growing narrowing in the area of the parties.
Over the past years, many have been advised to take back, not to be so pronounced, and then “all will be fine. ”
However, that is not why I have entered the political course.
32 years ago, I joined the Working Party as a student, because it was disgusting that the Thatcher government had so neglected the schools that our classroom was almost fascinated and then fought for better public supply for the most deprived people as local adviser and government minister.
I've never hidden my political views under the veins, and I've never done anything different during the last election.
Nottingham in East was quite clear for everyone about the political positions I represent and on which I disagree with the current management.
For those who supported the motion on Friday, I am telling you that in this situation, when the country goes to a Brext that will harm not only families, but also companies and public services, I don't understand why it is necessary to spend so much time and energy to question my loyalty to the leader of the Working Party.
However, my most important message is not to the members of the Nottingham Movement, but to my constituents, whether members of the Work Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to redemption or politically threatening to act in accordance with my own judgment and taking into account the interests of everyone.

Ayr-Melrose 38-17: Ayr breaks to the top
Two late attempts have been somewhat modified at the end, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved victory on the most entertaining game of the day, Tennesset’s Premiership.
The team is now at the top of the table, as the only fightless of the ten teams.
Thanks to their uneven protection and excessive use of the situation, they have won, so the homes and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We had to meet a great challenge in our games so far, but we are still fighting, so I have all the reasons for happiness, ” he said.
Robyn Christie, a player of Melrose, said: “We need to know that Ayr has made much better use of his circumstances than we do.”
Grant Anderson performed in 14 minutes, from which he made a Frazier Climo point, and Ayr was in the favor of the game, thanks to the yellow card from Warriors to Captain Rory Hughes, Melrose could not have taken the difference, but Jason Baggot's attempt did not have been a point.
Climo was shaking the protection of Ayr with a criminal, just at half-time, and then a one-person experiment, so the first half time ended with a result of 17-5 in favour of Ayr.
Melrose started the second half-time hard, and Patrick Anderson's attempt was selling Baggot, reducing the disadvantage of the team to five points.
Then it took a long time to play, since Ruaridh Knott had a serious injury and had to get him off the track, and Ayr continued to increase his advantage with the attempt of Stafford McDowall, whose beards managed to be found in Climo's involvement.
Blair Macpherson, the captain of Ayr, got a yellow card, and then Melrose in human history managed to prevent Bruce Colvine's experiment, breaking the pressure on them.
The home team began to lock up again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for installing Climo without a ball, MacPherson presented a touch down the line behind the Ayr attack team.
Climo sold, which he repeated almost immediately after the reopening, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry forward to the fifth attempt of the homes.
Still Game's main role in a new career in the catering industry
One of the Stars of Still Game, Ford Kieran, seems to be moving towards the catering industry: it turns out that a restaurant manager was headed.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in the popular series of BBC, which he writes together, in which he works with his old comic partner Greg Hemhill.
The couple announced that the next nine will be the final season, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he became the director of the Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was trying to benefit from Glasgow’s “floring restaurant industry”.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, not on the beach, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol around the Marine Command decorated with sailors in La Paz.
In the centers, ocean blue flags are floating.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon declare the following motto: “We have a ride to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
The memory of the lost coast, which was taken by Chile in a bloody conflict for resources of the 19th century, is still alive in Bolivia without the coast, and the desire to re-establish the waves of the Pacific is strong.
These hopes may have been the most powerful for many decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the first sentence of the International Court of Justice in October, which concludes five years of discussion.
“Bolicia has the ball that is stimulating people with the spirit of bonding and peace who are waiting for the final development in a positive mood, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bulgarians will monitor the decision of the International Court of Justice, hope that the Hague judiciary will be with Bolivia, and after several decades of rapsodicism, Chile will be obliged to sit on a negotiating table so Bolivia can have independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic, indigenous president of Bolivia, who looks at the conflicting battle that he has to continue for the next year's re-election, may lose a lot with the Monday sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific" stated at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is probably not going to decide in favour of Bolivia and that it would not change much of the situation if its decision would still be favourable to Bolivia.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands has no right to judge the areas of Chile and has also preconditioned that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was born less than six months after the final talks indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, expert in Chile in international law.
Besides, for the past four years, he didn't help Bolivia's case, but he even pulled it back.
"The issue of the sea exit has been replaced by the current government in Bolivia for its own purposes," Zaráte identified.
– Morales' hostile rhetoric has caused the rest of the Chilees to depart."
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue the negotiations at one point, but after what has happened, it will be extremely difficult to initiate a dialogue.
Since 1962, the two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other.
The former President, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, a representative of Bolivia in Haag, disagrees with the conclusion that the judicial decision would have been unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia has a “experienced opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile” and a chance to“ both get out of the closure of 139 years of conflict, ” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would have used the maritime debate to make a political advantage of it.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific,” he added.
– The judgment gives us the opportunity to see that it is time to go beyond the past."
North Korea: No nuclear dismantling until they can trust America
According to Ri Jongho, the North Korean Foreign Minister, his country will not be the first to profess its nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep their promises at the Singapore Summit to the leaders of the two rival countries.
The comment was made when it appeared that Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, was able to reopen the ongoing nuclear negotiations, more than three months after the Singapur summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jung.
According to Ri, I want to believe that the impediment of the continual sanctions and the American declaration of the closure of the Korean war will ever be enough to force North Korea to his knees.
Washington's apocalypse from accepting the statement if Phenjan does not take any significant steps towards decommissioning.
All Kim Jungun and President Donald Trump would like a new summit.
However, the wide-ranging skepticism is about Phenjan's commitment to decommissioning arsenal, which is likely to be the only key to its security.
Pompeo is planning a Phenyan visit next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows showed those huge head covers that will soon appear in top-class stores.
If you want to expand your hat collection, or you want to completely cover the day, you don't have to search anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually overgrown head covers as part of their Spring/Summer collection in 2019, which was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the stylish audience of Paris's fashion week.
No practical hats generated sensation on Instagram during the summer, and the designers above also set their attention to the runway.
Valentino's most beautiful piece was an overwhelming beige hat that was pen-like, wide-carima decorated and almost completely swallowed the heads of the models.
Among the other oversize supplements appeared with precious stones, a magical base, and even an ananas, which were not really designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also emerged with the choice of bizarre masks just before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn their mouths together, and they reminded me of Hannibal Lecter rather than the Haute couture.
One of these was like a diving mask, filled with a pipe and glasses, and another one looked like a melting ice cream.
If you get these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
The style analysts predict that huge hats are already on their way to the top class of clothing stores.
The overgrown hats follow the path of a 60 cm wide claw that we have seen from Rihanna to Emily Rataikowski.
The culture brand behind the small practical hat that conquered the social pages presented a new piece on the runway: a shore of salmon, almost the size of the bathing dress model.
The dark orange racist bag, decorated by raphiboys, with a white skin tooth on top, was one of the outstanding pieces of the La Riviera collection of Jacquemus in spring 2019.
The stylist of the stars, Luke Armitage, said to FEMAIL: “I expect that next summer the huge hats and beach bags will appear in the top-class dress stores. The designer has created a elementary effect from everyone that it would be difficult to deny the demand for oversize supplements."
John Edward: Language Knowledge Is Important for World Citizens
Scottish independent schools offer traditionally excellent education. In view of the new excellent test results, this situation has not changed by 2018, which is only further enhanced by individual and group successes in sports, art, music and other Community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30 000 students are studying in such institutions, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and aiming to provide students and parents with the best possible services.
Independent schools are trying to prepare students for education, higher education, their chosen career and the status of the people of the world.
In a educational sector where it is possible to design and introduce personalised school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and searched for educational subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, it comes to his head.
"But if you speak in his tongue, it will reach his heart."
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely exclusively on English if we want to build relations and trust with other countries.
We see from the results of this year's exams that students from independent schools throughout the country bring the best results from foreign languages.
68 percent of all students studying foreign languages reached higher Grade A (more than 85 percent).
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools show that 72 percent of students received higher Grades of Mandarin, while 72 students in German, 69 percent of French and 63 percent of Spanish students reached Grade A.
These results also suggest that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as essential knowledge, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today languages, such as chosen objects, have become at least as important as natural sciences, technology, technical sciences and mathematics, both in independent and other forms of schools.
The United Kingdom’s Committee for Employment and Vocational Training in 2014 has shown that 17% of employers believe that filling empty positions is facing difficulties due to a lack of language knowledge.
This also shows that language knowledge becomes increasingly necessary to enable young people to pursue a successful career.
As foreign languages are awaiting more and more jobs, language knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if he learns a foreign language, he gains lifelong knowledge with a clear advantage.
The fact that you can communicate directly with other nationals will automatically provide a competitive advantage for those who speak more than one language.
According to the YouGov survey, 75 percent of respondents in the UK in 2013 could not be able to join others in any foreign language, and France was the only language spoken by more than 10% of respondents (15 percent).
It is therefore important that we now focus on the teaching of children’s languages.
Speaking in a number of languages, especially in developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children, with a better chance of bleeding as an adult.
Every school in Scotland will be dealing with different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while many will be teaching languages such as mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of paramount importance for the United Kingdom by 2020.
Whatever the child’s interest area is, he will learn more optional languages at independent schools and will be trained as teachers who are experts in his own territory.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and provides them with the skills they need to succeed, and keep whatever the future is.
It is not difficult to notice that in the current global business environment, languages are still vital for the future of a country, and this should be reflected in education.
In fact, the knowledge of modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools offer the possibility of choice, diversity and quality education to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire – this should be the way.
John Edward, President of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron presents with Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
You don't have to wait long for fans who sit on needles to see LeBron James first step in the L.A. Lakers colors.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James was going to play on the early Sunday opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you're going to spend on the field, that's still a question.
“ More than one, and less than 48," wrote Walton on Lakers’ official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, told me that James would probably be playing for a limited period.
After a couple of days ago, James was asked what his plans were for Lakers in the pre-six season.
"I don't have to play in the pre-session at this point of my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's Western Virginia campaign and YouTube Channel
Donald Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts a long series of campaign events tonight.
This will be the first of the five ranked events of Trump next week, including stops such as Tennessee and Mississippi who support him.
Now that the vote confirming the candidate for the vacancies of the Supreme Court has been postponed, Trump is trying to gather supporters for the forthcoming mid-term elections, as the danger exists that Republicans will lose power over the Congress when the votes run in November.
When will Trump begin tonight's Western Virginia event, and where can you follow me online?
The speech of Trump Wheelingi (Nyugat-Virginia) begins this evening, which is on Saturday, 29 September 2018, at 7:00 east time.
Trump's Western Virginia meeting can be followed online through the live transfer of YouTube.
Trump is likely to affect the hearing of his supreme court candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week, which was particularly tense in the light of the charges of sexual harassment, and the Senate's confirmatory vote was suspended for up to one week until the FBI investigated.
However, the primary objective of the sudden rising events is to assist the Republicans before the elections in November.
According to Trump's campaign advisor, the five events next week serve “the activation of voters and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority that are currently held in the Senate and the Assembly”, says Reuters.
"In order to be able to manage the Congress in his hands, the critical point of his political plans is that the President visits as many states as possible as possible. We look at a short period of campaign," reported a campaignist who asked Reuters to listen to his name.
The evening event planned for Wesbanco Arena in Keleingi is "You can also bring support from the States of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and you can even get into the news of the pittsburgh media," says West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will be the second time in the last month to visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate of the Western Virginia Republican, Patrick Morrisey, who has been unfavourable.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should be involved personally in order to better perform the surveys," said Simon Haeder, a politician of the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup of 2018: The American team struggles with full shoulder width before Sunday individuals to keep hope alive
After three one-sided attempts, the game four on Saturday afternoon needed the Ryder cup.
Fortunate and momentum is a very air-to-air sporting concept, yet every player believes in it, mostly in competitions like Ryder's cup.
So who's got the ball now?
“They had six points of leadership, and only four have the advantage, so we can say we have the ball right now," said Jordan Spieth, walking away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe is still leading four points, and there are 12 more.
The Americans, as Spieth tells, feel that they finally got a little backslide, and they can draw encouragement from a lot of things, including the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and they both got three points of the four.
Spieth proved to be incorrect from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
The victories of the victories were increasingly louder as they went along with the circle, inventing and compensating a critical gig in the fourth game, with him and Thomas in a double disadvantage after two.
Deciding the game has resulted in a cry of joy similar to hole 15, a kind that can believe the viewer that the American team has not lost everything yet.
“Only to dig deep into yourself, and only to care for your own game, ” said Spieth.
That's exactly what's waiting for the players.
18 holes for the chance you're leaving a trail.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular couple of the Ryder cup, could get more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's strange, but loveful couple has brought four out of four, and it seems that they can't make mistakes.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who did not perform on Saturday afternoon above the par, and on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and on the last nine stages of Friday morning, they provided a similar performance.
Thanks to this series and the dynamics created between them and the people who support them, they became the match on Sunday, and no one expects Europe to win on the Le Golf National Course, such as Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best thing to do would be a victory at the same time in different holes.
However, the victory of Europeans would be too early to celebrate.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were soon executed Sergio García, the four of the morning heroes, when she played with Alex Noren.
One and two hits over the par at the first nine holes in Spain and Sweden, which pushed them into a wave valley that they had no chance to climb out of.
On Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of the hole.
The four-ball games and the four-games are very entertaining from the point of view thanks to the interactions of the couples. You can observe what kind of advice you don't give, and how you can change the strategy in a moment.
Europe has been a better team to play, and it has a significant advantage for the last day, but this section has shown that the American team has the course needed to fight, and that many of them have missed them, especially on the American side.
Europe will begin its last day with 10-6 advances
Europe can begin the last day of the Ryder cup with a good chance after the Saturday ball and the four-game match ended with 10-6 results against the United States.
The profound Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the hairdress, and they won two wins against the illusion of Tiger Woods, thus raising the difference to four points on the Le Golf National Course.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, who is trying to recover the trophy that has been lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated against the continuously defective American team during the morning's four-ball match, winning the series by 3-1.
America showed greater resistance during the fours, bringing two games, but they couldn't break the difference.
Jim Furyk's team should get eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who won four points in the series, while he and Molinari, who are only referred to as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair of the Ryder Cup's history, which acquired four points on four opening games.
After being beaten by the Woods-Patrick Reed in the four balls, their great team game defeated the unmotivated Woods and the American novel, Bryson Dechambeau, a strong 5&4.
Woods, who pulled himself into two games on Saturdays, sometimes snatched his talent, but he's already lost 19 of his 29 games from the four balls and fours, seven of them.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four balls, returned to her partner Henrik Stenson, and in the fours, she was defeated by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world-ranked first and third place.
However, Europe did not succeed all of this pleasant, mild day, from Paris to the southwest.
The three-fold title protector Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans with two points on Saturday.
A grievous 2&1 win against the couple of Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls, and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice a team managed to return from the four-point disadvantage to the individual races, although the Furyk's title-defence team is an indefinite enough to maintain the trophy.
After two days, however, they only succeeded in the second best, a Sunday counterattack seems to be quite unrealistic.
"Actively" to unanimously deport North Korea if you do not trust your negotiating partner
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions only increased the confidence in the United States of America, and it was excluded that the country would surrender its nuclear arms unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Jongho, at the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation, said that North Korea had taken ‘significant and generous steps’ during the last year, such as shut down nuclear and missile experiments, closed the location of nuclear experiments and promised not to expand its scope of nuclear arsenal and nuclear technology.
“ However, we do not see similar responses from the Americans, ” he said.
– In the lack of trust in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not secured, and under such circumstances it is not possible to take off unilaterally and first."
Although Ri reiterated the frustration of North Korea regarding the fact that Washington is opposed to the idea of "smart" nuclear decommissioning, which, according to the scenario, would receive North Korea's rewards for the steps it has taken, his statement seemed significant because he did not clearly reject the unilateral nuclear decommissioning as Phenjan has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jungun and Donald Trump at the first summit ever, between a powerful American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, and during which Kim promised to work on the "nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the integrity of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to make an official point at the end of the Korean War 1950-53, but according to the United States, Phenjan needs to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington didn't allow strict international sanctions on North Korea.
“ America insists that we start with nuclear decommissioning, and it increases pressure by sanctions to force his will on us, and also protests against the end of the war, ” Ri said.
– The idea that sanctions can force us on our knees is the desire of those who do not know us.
The problem is that unsustainable sanctions just increase our suspicion."
Mr Ri has not mentioned that he would be planning a second summit between Kim and Trump, which, however, was discussed separately by the American President at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
Rather, the Minister pointed out that three meetings were held between Kim and the South Korean President Mun Dzsein in the last five months and added: “If the nuclear decommissioning country was South Korea, and not the United States of America, the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a patrol situation.”
However, the voice of Ri's speech was dramatically different from that of the United Nations General Assembly when he announced that the targeting of the North American continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump, the wicked president, Kim called a "raket man", who is on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “full destruction last year, has praised Kim that he has the courage to take steps towards decommissioning, but he also noted that there is a lot of work left and the sanctions remain until North Korea performs nuclear decommissioning.
On Wednesday, Trump said that no time limit was imposed, that is, “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Phenjan for the steps that have taken so far.
On Thursday, the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said: “The sanctions of the Security Council must be undisturbed until we have reached the actual, proven nuclear decommissioning.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to reduce the financing of Phenjan's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rí during the break of the United Nations Assembly and then said that next month he would return to Phenjan to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo's been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
After leaving Phenjan in July, he announced that progress was made, however, North Korea charged hours later that he had made claims like ‘gengist’.
In the context of the meeting with Mun this month, North Korea promised to take off a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States also ‘ take the necessary steps. ’
According to Mun, the “going steps” mentioned by Kim would be security guarantees which Trump has promised in Singapore and steps that could lead to normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are trained to get enough rest
This year, a new study of Harvard University has turned the students into more sleep, fighting the entire night course of caffeine heating against a more spatial mascot culture.
A academic concluded that students of the world’s first number of universities are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care for themselves.
The course, according to which the first kind of training in the United States was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who taught sleep medicine at Harvard Medical College and practitioners at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
It encouraged the course to develop a lecture earlier on the impact of sleeping on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked: ‘Why am I just now, as a senior, facing this? ’
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
During the first course launched this year, students will be informed about the fundamental impact of appropriate sleep habits on their study and sport performance, not only on their general public.
According to Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and the head of the University Health Service, the university decided to start the course because during the week, students were found extremely unattended.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
One example shows a picture of a college room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, gymnastics and books to get to know the effects of caffeine and light, the way in which the sports performance is influenced by sleeplessness and why bed routine is important.
In another part, it is described with participants how long-term sleep loss increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
They present the map of the university area with interactive icons to tailor participants to the daily routine.
“We know that we will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
But we believe that you have the right to these knowledge, as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture in which it is expected to be able to study one night continues to flourish, he said, adding that modern technology and the constantly increasing pressure on students lead to growing problems of inadequacy.
Sufficient and quality sleep protects students’ “secret weapon” in combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even obesity, as sleep deprivation forces the brain into an appetite and causes continued hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course, a 19-year-old student in California who studied chemistry and biophysics, and last year he hired one of the professor's courses at Harvard.
He said that the people who heard there opened his eyes and encouraged him to start a university education.
He hopes that postgraduate students will be able to participate in a similar training program before they are placed in the competition sector.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a warning to bed, wake up, and meet the harmful effects of the “Blue Light” issued by electric screens and LED light sources, which can easily reduce them from their daily rhythm and make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1-0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and gains gold
Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga bombed Steven Gerrard's scattered team in Livingston 1-0.
The ibroxians tried to get their first alien victory after the 4-1 victory in St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard suffered the second defeat of Gary Holt's team from 18 games led as manager. So they left eight points from the first position of the Ladbrokes Premiership (the Scottish Championship).
Menga hit me seven minutes before the half-time, and the unmotivated team of Rangers hasn't even been able to do the equilibrium.
While the Rangers slipped down to the sixth place, Livingston went up to the third, just because of the gole difference.
Rangers can also face further difficulties after the coastal signal Calum Spence’s head injury requires medical care due to an object that is probably thrown off the viewer of the guests.
Gerrard also changed eight points on the team that came into the predecessor of the Betfred Cup by squeezing the Ayr.
Dead's going to Livingston with the same 11 people who took a point from Hearts last week, and would certainly have been happy to watch his perfected team strangle his game for him wherever he was.
Although the Rangers were running the ball, Livingston took more with what he got.
They could've gotten a goal in the first two minutes when he started Scott Pittman to the gate of Allan McGregor with his first administration, but he couldn't sell it to the middle court.
Keaghan Jacobs' low free kick was landed at Craig Halkett's team captain, but his guardian, Alan Lithgow, found only the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control of you, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he deserved punishment at the fifteen minutes when he confronted Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson was able to put away his complaints in Colombia.
Rangers could show only the first two half-time hood shots, but Liam Kelly, the former ibrox gate, had little trouble with the head of Lassana Coulibaly and the weak shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's attempt in the 34th minute was confronted with the running of the game, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, just for their hard work.
The Rangers have missed a bowl that Jacobs forced me to do it again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball on Scott Robinson, who found Menga great for a light ending.
Gerrard decided during the break, he replaced Coulibalyt to Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately explained the effect of the game when the extreme Morelos ugled, but Kelly, bringing the impressive form, blocked at time.
Livingston continued to play exactly the game that suited him, and Lithgow and Halkett swept the long balls after each other.
Holt's team could have been more advantageous in the last few minutes, but McGregor took the net well and hit Jacobs' position before Lithgow drew up from a angle.
Glenn Middleton, in exchange for the Rangers, tried to fight another eleven when he got into a fight with Jacobs, but Thomson hasn't been persuaded.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger Counter
A detail of our “Sunday Breakfast” almanach: September 30, 1882, right now exactly 136 years... is the day that the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that may have resulted in a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter is one of the basic instruments of science and thanks to the 1950s, strange cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, “Bells of Coronado” (Coronado bells) became part of the pop culture:
Man: "What is this miracle?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter. Radioactive minerals, such as uranium, can be searched with it.
If you put on this headphone, you can hear the voice of the atoms that are released for the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Listen to me, now he's a bit of a prick!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, he continues to live in his name - bearing invention.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the abnormal cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" and destroy the abnormal cells
A vaccine given as part of treatment teaches the immune system to recognise abnormal cells.
It is part of the method that immune cells must be extracted from the patient and then modified in a laboratory.
This is how they can “see” the protein that is accompanied by a variety of cancers, which is used to inject the immune cells back into the patient.
A experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect abnormal cells could say goodbye to her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is part of the extraction of immune cells from the patient; they are modified in the laboratory to “see” the protein HER2 that is commonly associated with multiple cancer diseases; then to transplant the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of the American National Institute for Cancer (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, ” including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method based on highlighting immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has already been used to treat one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West SNL, wearing the MAGA cap, was peaked in a disgraceful tyra supporting Trump.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was expelled in Saturday Night Live's studio after an incontinent manifestation, apprehending President Donald Trump of the United States, and then informed him that in 2020 he would apply for the presidential post.
After making the third song of Ghost Town that night in his cap, made Make America Great Again, he began to speak against the Democrats, and again stressed his support for Trump.
“Sometimes when I talk to someone who is white, asks: ‘How can you like Trump, as a racist?’
If I was interested in racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show was opened by Matt Damon with a parody in which Brett Kavanaugh, a Hollywood star, made a joke about the charges of sexual harassment of Christine Blasey Ford before the Senate Justice Committee.
Although it hasn't been broadcast, Chris Rock has uploaded the video about the West Discussion to the social sites.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get a joke out of the West with the charge.
West even complained to the audience that he was pissed behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They were frightened behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out in that hat."
I was intimidated!
And they said I'm in a drowned place," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see a drowned place? I'll wear my Superman cap because that means they can't tell me what to do. You want the world to progress?
Try with love."
His manifestations were at least twice haunted by a whisper from the audience, and the SNL performers seemed to be embarrassed by one of the witnesses who said to Variety: “The whole studio was silenced in silence.”
Westet was invited in the last minute, instead of the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend Mac Miller rapper died a few days before.
West also raised questions when he presented his song I Love it as a perrier glass.
West was provided by the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, in a Tweet: “One of the bravest spirits: WHERE HE SHOULD THINK.”
Karen Hunter, host of a chatter show, tweaked that West was simply “sone, and that's great.”
“But I have decided not to reward someone (with the purchase of her music or her fashion articles or with the support of her ‘arts’) who I believe is a kind of ideology and spreading which is harmful to the community I belong to.
He's free.
"But we too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, now he is “the creature previously known as Kanye West.”
He's not the first artist who changed his name, and he's gone into Diddy's prints, which we know as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
Rappermate Snoop Dogg also named Snoop Lion and, of course, the late legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the Star of the Thrones, finds exaggerated maleness harmful
Kit Harington is mostly known as Jon Snow in the battle of the Thrones, and he often grabs a sword in the imagination series of HBO with violence in the middle age.
However, the 31 - year - old actor spoke against the stereotypical mascot heroes, highlighting that, in view of such heroes, young boys may often feel that hard action is needed to fight respect.
Kit stated in his statement to The Sunday Times Culture that he thought he was “different” and raised the question of how to deal with the adverse effects of overriding maleness in the #MeToo age.
The star, who recently married his 31-year-old serial colleague Rose Leslie, told me that she thinks it would be very important to deal with the problem.
“ I am personally concerned with this matter — how has the imagination of maleness become so distorted? ” asked the actor.
– What have we taught men when they were children about the problem we are dealing with?"
According to Kit, television is also responsible for the spread of the disrupted image of maleness, since the shows often contain very masking characters.
He continued to say: “What is the one that was born with us, and what is what we learn?
What does the street and TV tell young boys, which makes them feel like men can only be in this way?
I think that is one of the big questions of our age – and how we can change it.
'Cause it clearly shows that something is wrong with young men."
Kit stated in the interview that after the summer season of the series, he will not be included in the Tronok Battle Series or Events, because “he has a body of battles and horses.”
From November, Kit Sam Shepard True West will play a major role in the recycling of his film, which is about a producer and a brother who pursues a robbery lifestyle.
The actor told me that the best thing he got from the battle of the Thrones was his wife, Rose, who he knew when he was making the show.
“ I met my wife on the set, so I came to see my future family and my life ahead of me, ” he said Kit.
Rose Ygritte, who was in love with Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy prize fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: In China, the number of new patients increased by 14%
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14% in the country.
According to health officials, this means more than 820 000 stakeholders.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, the number of reported cases increased by around 40 000.
Compared to the previous, there is a change in the fact that a significant majority of newly infected people receive the disease sexually.
In some parts of China, the disease spread rapidly through the transfusion of infected blood.
However, health officials at a conference in the province of Yunn said that the number of such cases has since been reduced to almost zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100 000.
The transfer of HIV by sexual means constitutes a serious problem for the Chinese LMBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against society has been very strong since.
According to estimates in various studies, 70 to 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men are finally married to women because of the conservative order of the country.
In many cases, the disease is spread in these relationships due to inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to anti-HIV medicines as part of the problem-solving programme.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her crew members would leak the data of the Republican senators and condemn "hazardous lies" and "combined theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters rejected the accusations that one of his crew's members published the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia site of Senators.
According to the Democratic Representative of Los Angeles, these claims were distributed by “wide-right” experts and websites.
"Lie, lie and even more nasty lies," wrote Waters on Twitter.
The information provided was allegedly included the address and telephone number of Senator Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch in Utah.
The information came on Thursday on the Internet. The publicist is unknown, but it is sure that they were published from the Capitol Mountain during the hearing of the Senate of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
The leaking took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundi and Red State, are linked to the IP address identified as a source to Waters' office, and they also communicated information about one of Waters' crew members, writes The Hill.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars,” continued Waters.
– My team member is not responsible for leaking information. However, his right to anonymity, to protect personal data and to security has been damaged by fraudulent and lying accusations.
These accusations are completely unfounded, fake, and obviously lie."
Waters' statements were aligned with criticism on the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, former press secretary of the White House.
“This is an angry denial,” wrote Fleisher.
– Based on this, Waters appears not to have the blood temperature required for the representation of its representatives.
If someone's suspected of something he didn't do, he can't react angryly.
You can't behave so badly.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
You must remain calm and calm."
Waters' response to Mr Fleisher seems to be compared to the reaction of Judge Kavanaugh's Democratic critics, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is a Republican candidate for the representatives of Waters at the mid-term elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
"If true, this is serious," he wrote in his message.
Waters wrote in his communication that his office notified the ‘competent authorities and police authorities’ in the case of false charges.
"We are concerned that the perpetrators are known," continued Waters, and that they are legally liable for any action that threatens or damages any member of the crew."
Johnny English again hits, or Rowan Atkinson's paralyzed spies
Today it has become a tradition that we are looking for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and there is no exception for the franchise under the name Johnny English, which can be classified in the category of action play/parodia, which is the first part of which entered the cinema in 2011, Johnny English in 2003, the second, Johnny English reloaded.
Will the British nation become the new export product of sarcastic satires that paradite ourselves, in which we are living on our own obvious paralysis?
There is so much certain that the glamorous, rubber-faced, incompetent, Johnny English had sufficient mutations for a new return – it is clear from his name that this comic character has been created so that the crowds of non-English countries are laughing at it.
Johnny English, of course, is a stubborn secret agent who thinks he's charming with his bizarre manner, so he reminds you a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally, the guy who has contributed to his presentation of the headline of the Fireworks at the opening of the Olympics in London in 2012.
The character is originally based on the mysterious international traveller attended by Atkinson once in a long-lasted Barclaycard TV promotion and left chaos everywhere.
There are some good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved the way Johnny English dressed in a medium - ageed armor, approaching a helicopter, and then, for a few moments, the rotors were knocking on his helmet.
Atkinson's comic venoms are well valid in the film, but the humor of the film does not really work, and it does not even seem unnecessary, as franchises with a "comic" voice today, such as James Bond movies, or the Mission Impossible series, are too brave to touch the sense of humor.
It feels that the humor of the film is rather targeting children, and for me, Johnny English's fleasing, his successful adventures are not reaching the level of ideas and genius that Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is inherited: Great Britain is in serious danger.
A cybercriminal broke into the super secret online network of the British spy network and revealed the identity of all the British agents to the greatest scary of the licensing agent Kevin Eldon, who, unfortunately, only had such a small role in the film.
This could be the last angle in the coffin of the selfish and distributing Prime Minister whose political popularity is still in ruins: Emma Thompson is practically designing Theresa May and bringing everything out of the otherwise poorly written character.
Intelligence advisors will tell him that since the identity of every active agent has come out, he'll have to set up a sedated agent for work.
Of course, this relaxed agent, Johnny English, who has worked as a teacher since his resignation in a premature school, but he teaches children to spy – of course, there are funny scenes here, while English describes the basis of spying as a “Rocksuli”.
English will be transported quickly to Whitehall, where he will meet again at the emergency briefing with his former, suffering weapons carrier, Bough, who is now being formed by Ben Miller.
Bough has been married since then and married the captain of a submarine, who always has an ear to mouth — the captain is formed by Vicki Pepperdine, who was seeking a much better role than that.
Thus, the two-armed “Batman and Robin ” of His Highness’s National Security Service is re-established and is confronted with Ophelia Bulletova, who is formed by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko as a true destiny.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is increasingly intruded by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve the digital problems of Great Britain: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy is shaped.
English and Bough start their clown mission: they burn a pussy French restaurant as a waiter, then they smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury yacht, and English actually releases the hell when using a VR-heads, trying to get to know Volta's apartment.
We need these stations to get to the final development, but whatever joy and revelation we've got, it might give us a little too much impression of a child movie.
The outcome is pretty medieval.
As with the other Johnny English films, I have already asked the question: Can't the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a talented role?
The British Labour Party denies that she would take a four-day week of work while paying the British for five days of work.
Jeremy Corbyn's working party is working on a radical draft, introducing the four-day week of work, all of this by working for five days' salary.
The party is alleged to want workers to benefit from the revolution of artificial intelligence (MI) by providing company managers with an extra day off due to increased income.
According to the draft, the workers would be given a three-day weekend while they would take you home the same as before.
According to sources, the idea would be “ fit” to the party's economic programme, which aims to fit the language of the balance sheet on the side of the workers in the country.
It also supports the idea of a four-day week work week, and they believe that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
One of the leading officials of the Working Party said to the Sunday Times: “The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen from one day to another, the week of four days of work is an idea that fits the party's programme that will fit the language of the balance sheet to the workers in the economy, and also fits into the overall industrial strategy of the party."
It would not be the first of the Working Party that supports such an idea, the Green Party has already campaigned at the 2017 parliamentary elections with the promise of a four-day week.
However, the idea does not benefit from the support of the Working Party as a whole.
The Speaker of the Labour Party said: “The four-day week of work is not part of the policies supported by the Party, and the issue is not even on the agenda.”
Mr John McDonnell presented his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the working party conference last week.
McDonnell said that he was determined to recover power from the “unfamous directors” and the“ winners ” of the regimes.
If the plans of the shadow finance minister were implemented, the shareholders of the water service companies would not receive the full profits they would pay, because a Labour Party government would use "reductions" as a punishment for harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed that he plans to become a member of the board of directors and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would reclassify 10% of the shares of private companies to the employees, which could also be able to obtain 500 important dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy betrayed in the "60 Minutes" show that the Kavanaugh FBI investigation could change their opinions.
As a result of the investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote will be held at least one week later than the original date.
In a Sunday interview with Scott Pelley, journalist John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, the Republican Senators asked if the FBI could find something to think about.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his South Carolina colleague.
“ I understand, of course, ” said Kennedy.
That's what I said before the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called you after the case was exploded, and I asked you, “You did?”
His answer was firm and clear."
However, Graham's vote seems to be concrete.
“I have already decided about Brett Kavanaugh, and I need extremely serious accusations to change my mind, ” said Graham.
– Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett strongly denied the allegations, he added to Graham, Christine Blasay Ford.
– And none of the people named by Dr. Ford justified the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new will come up."
What is a global citizen festival and has it been able to reduce poverty?
The annual music event, the Global Citizen Festival, begins on Saturday in New York. World stars are present at the festival to stand up for a truly noble purpose: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival is now held seven times, it is expected that tens of thousands of people will fill the Central Park's Great Pazsit, where participants will not only have Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes' performance, but also draw attention to the real purpose of the event: the eradication of deep poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was held first in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is operated by an international group of interests that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing number of people involved in active combating poverty.
Free tickets to the concert can be obtained (if they are willing to pay for VIP tickets) for those who undertake to perform certain tasks or "actions", such as voluntary work, e-mailing to a leading politician, a phone call, or any other meaningful activity that they can draw attention to the project: the eradication of poverty.
But how successful has the global citizen actually been in achieving the goals set for the past 12 years?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with a concert mark to convince others about the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called "clictivity" when people feel that they have contributed to a case by signing a online petition or writing a Twitter message?
According to the Global Citizen's data since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been carried out by the project supporters, which served a number of different objectives.
According to the organisation, these actions contributed to the allocation of $37 billion by world leaders to policies and commitments to combat poverty, which could affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group claimed 390 commitments and announcements that they were derived from their actions, 10 billion of them have already been paid or collected during fundraising.
The group estimates that the money collected had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The Power of Nutrition is one of the main commitments, which is a partnership between investors and exporters in the United Kingdom, which aims to “help children to achieve their potential.” The organization promised Rwanda $35 million to contribute to the eradication of hunger after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from “global citizens”.
Tracey Ullman, ambassador of Power of Nutrition at a live concert in April 2018.
The group also claims that after the United Kingdom was requested in over 5,000 actions to improve the food for mothers and children, the government has allocated resources for the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the food of 5 million women and children.
One of the often repeated questions published on the Global Citizen’s website is: “Why do they think deep poverty can be eliminated?".
The Global Citizen responds: “It will be a long and hard way, sometimes failing and failing.
But like previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we will achieve our goal because we are stronger together."
Among other things, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will perform this year's New York event, and the broadcasters will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Minister of Interior: The United States would use a marine blockade to prevent Russian energy export
“If necessary”, Washington would either embark the Navy against the entry of Russian energy carriers into the market, such as not to reach Russian energy in the Middle East, quoted the U.S. Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke from Washington Examiner.
According to Zinke, Russia's active presence in Syria, in particular with regard to Russian operations on the request of the legitimate Syrian Government, is merely an excuse for Russia's acquisition of new energy markets.
"I think they're only in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe," said Zinke in a statement.
And the Minister of Interior says there are ways of preventing the Russians.
“The United States of America is able to ensure that marine routes are open, and they can be placed under blockade if necessary, so it can ensure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” said Zinke.
Zinke arranged its words to the participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance group – the nonprofit group defines itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington's action against Russia and Iran and noted that it was practically the same methods.
“Iran and Russia can be punished economically in the same way as using existing energy carriers and introducing new ones”, said Zinke, while he called Russia a "one-dimensional economy", pointing to the country's dependence on fossil energy carriers.
The statements are consistent with the Trump Government's plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus pushing Russia out of the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, the leading officials of the Trump government, including the President himself, persuade Germany to withdraw from the "incorrect" pipeline project called North Stream 2 which, if it is implemented, makes Moscow a " hostage" Germany.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the existing capacity is duplicating, thus increasing to 110 billion cubic metres, North Stream 2 lines alone of economic nature.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is so strongly opposed to the project for economic considerations, which is the manifestation of unfair competition.
“I take the same view that energy should not be used for pressure and that consumers should be given the opportunity to choose their suppliers freely” said the Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting with Rick Perry American Energy Minister in Moscow in September.
The American convincing attempt went backwards because Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German leading industrial organisation, the BDI, called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy, as well as to keep itself away from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I consider it a problem when a third country intervenes in our energy affairs," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after the last meeting of Ms Merkel and Vladimir Putin.

Sarah Palin Track referred to the PTSD of Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
The 26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after she signed up in September
He was arrested on Monday night for suspicion of domestic violence.
“ What my son goes through, what he has been through since he has returned, I understand the other families who experience the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers return to home, ” Sarah Palin said to the audience at the meeting of Donald Trump in Oklahoma.
The arrest of Palin's son was called “the elephant in the room ” and said that his son, like the other war veterans, “he came back, and he was struggling, and he kept thinking that he would have due respect for the ministry that his companions, the pilots and all other members of the army did for the country.”
Trak Palin was arrested in Washington, Alaska for assault on a woman in the family. Dan Bennett, the spokesman of the Washington Police Department, said that, according to a report, Trak Palin was committed by a gun and he was drunk to commit domestic violence.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support judicial review of asylum policy
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support the judicial review of the new American asylum policy, in which those who are fleeing from gangs or domestic violence cannot be sanctioned.
Expert letters from 18 different Member States and from Washington D.C. were written on Friday in Washington to support a asylum seeker who attacks politics in court, writes NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the case Grace vs. Sessions, initiated by the US Civil Law Union in August, was not published.
He was assaulted by his partner and the “sons of the violent crime gang”, but the American officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
The prosecutors of the States that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as places where many asylum applications have been made to the United States, because in these countries the violence committed by criminal gangs and within the family is a constant problem.
The new American asylum policy has withdrawn a decision taken by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) in 2014, which allowed non-documentary immigrants to seek asylum from domestic violence.
Karl Racine, D.C. Attorney General, Washington, stated in a Friday communication that the new policy ‘ leaves away decades of state, federal and international law. ’
‘All asylum applications under federal law must be addressed in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the case, and such a barrier infringes this principle’, states in the expert letter.
Attorneys also explained in the letter that immigration rejection policy is a harm to the US economy, because immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneur and “fill the lowest level of jobs.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the asylum judges in June not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and crime gangs.
“The right of asylum is to leave his country for persecution or for fear of persecution due to racial, religious, nationality, belonging to a specific social group, or political conviction,” said Sessions on 11 June at the time of the policy announcement.
Asylum has not been established to solve all the problems of people worldwide, every day and day – whether they are of any serious nature.
Desperate rescue in Palu, the number of dead has doubled, rescue schemes race with time
The situation of survivors is becoming more undesirable.
“Everyone is very tense, ” says Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, while he is sedating his pussy little boy in one of the evacuation centers of Palu.
- The ambulances bring the bodies every minute.
We barely have drinks."
Some of the inhabitants returned to their homes to save from the wet stuff that can still be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals, which have also been damaged by the 7.5-powered earthquakes, are not convinced to provide for people.
Some of the injured, including the broken backbone and shoulder Dwi Harist, were sent to the Palui Military Hospital. The patients were seen outside the hospital building because of the high-speed follow-ups.
The man had tears of his eyes when he recalled, as the fifth floor hotel room in which he and his wife and daughter were invaded, shattered into the destruction.
“There was no time for escape.
I think I was stuck in the falling walls, said Haris to the Associated Press, and then added that his family came to town for a wedding.
– I heard my wife crying for help, and then she became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The American Ambassador is accusing China of proposing the country with propaganda advertisements.
The Chinese ambassador in the United States accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the American press. This was one week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided ad in an American newspaper, which highlighted the mutual benefits of trade relations between America and China.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump of the United States referred to the advertisement of the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa’s largest copy of the paper, while accused China of attempting to intervene in the United States Congress elections on November 6, China denies the charge.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the American elections, some American officials who declare Reuters represent a new stage in Washington's ever stronger action against China, aimed at putting China under pressure.
Although it is not unusual for foreign governments to promote trade with their countries through advertising, there will be an increasingly intensive commercial war between Beijing and Washington, in which more and more duties are imposed on each other's import products.
According to American and Chinese experts, the Chinese duties at the beginning of the commercial war sought to target exporters of countries where Trump and the Republican Party are popular, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, former Chinese ambassador from the United States and former governor of Iowa for several cycles, said that Beijing suffered injury to American workers, farmers and shops, because the State of Iowa exports significant quantities of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in his opinion article on Sunday Des Moines Register that “China continues to rub off our country by publishing propaganda advertising in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government takes advantage of the American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid ads in Des Moines Register, ” wrote Branstad.
– However, if we go to a newspaper shop in Peking, we can barely find critical articles. The Chinese press does not at all reflect the different opinions of the Chinese people about the growing growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party."
Branstad added that “One of the most famous newspapers of China was not willing to bring down” his article, but the newspaper was not named.
Eminents say that Republicans can displace female voters with Kavanaugh before the mid-term elections.
According to the investigators, a number of high-ranking Republican politicians will defend Brett Kavanaugh's supreme judiciary in the cross-fire of sexual harassment, so they can lose the support of women's voters in particular before the mid-term elections.
The case caused intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be withdrawn – says Grant Reeher, a politician of the University of Syrian Maxwell School, in one of the Saturday articles of The Hill.
Reeher has expressed doubts about the fact that the FBI investigation proposed by Senator Jeff Flake of the Republic of Arizona will be sufficient to relax angry voters.
“The women will not forget what happened yesterday – neither tomorrow nor November –” said a Washington newspaper named D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, the head counselor and national speaker of the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday.
According to Mic’s report on Friday morning, some demonstrators in the Senate corridor scanned: “The November is coming!” because the Republican Justice Committee, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasay Ford, decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination.
"Democracy enthusiasm and motivation will jump to an amazing extent," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“ They often say that it has already been very high, and that is true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the insecure women voters in the outdoors and young people (18-29 years), who do not enthusiastically for the president, often do not go to vote."
The analysts already assumed before Ford's public confession that he could go back to the Republicans if they continue to stand by Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, and since then, Ford described in his statement in detail why he charged sexual harassment to the supreme court candidate.
“The Republican Party was mistaken on an indigenous ground” said in the beginning of last week NBC News, Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Commission.
"This is not only about the Commission's vote and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is appointed, but also about the way the Republicans handled the case and behaved with Ford," said Guy Cecil, Director of the United States to assist the election of Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are quite shared in the fact that Ford or Kavanaugh's confession is considered to be true, and Kavanaugh is a little more believed than Ford.
According to the new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents fully or more believed Ford's statement, and 35% of Kavanaugh's responders gave the same answer.
In addition, 38% of the respondents say Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied in his statement, while only 30% of Ford's respondents believed that.
On the basis of Flake's motion, the FBI is currently investigating the authenticity of Ford's claims, as Kavanaugh's other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, writes on Guardian.
Ford swore a week ago under oath before the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh was drunk when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the supreme court candidate showed him his gender organ at a party in the 1980s when both of them were studying at Yale.
The World Network Inventor would start a new internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, starts a start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solidal and users can choose where to store their data and who can access each information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “to acquire the rule of the world. ”
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
– It's a historical moment."
The application with Solid technology enables people to create their own "personal online data storage", a POD, a.k.a.
It can contain lists, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available at the same time from the same browser.
In the personal online repository, the unique thing is that the user can decide who has access to its data in its entirety.
This is referred to as “implementation of the right to self-deposit of personal data”.
John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, says that the company is responsible for providing resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contract developers working in the project and one community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, world technology developers can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt.
Berners-Lee has been told that he and his team are not asking "Facebook and Google to introduce the technology that brings total change, which would put the business models of companies on top of their heads from one day to the other."
"We don't ask for permission from them."
In a note published on the Media Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt was “providing commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the newly built Solidra network.”
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts University of Technology.
Berners-Lee has participated in the debates on the neutrality of the Internet in recent months as an important opinion form.
Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee added: “I am unattractively optimistic about the next era of the world net.”
Bernard Vann is celebrating a clergy minister in the First World War of Victoria
The only sign of the Victoria Cross was given to the Anglican Pastor's hometown, 100 years after he was a hero in the First World War.
Mr. Bernard Vann has earned a medal during the attack on the Bellenlise and Lehacourt of September 29, 1918.
Four days later, however, a sniper killed him, so he could never know that he deserved the highest award of the British armed forces.
Two of his grandsons of the memorial embassy of his honor was embraced at the Saturday celebration in Rushden, Northamptonshire County.
One of his grandson Michael Vann said that the memorial stone was given exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act of honor.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Bernard Vann, a respectable and vice-president, led his flag on the Canal de Saint-Quentin channel “in the midst of a thick fog and heavy cannon and machine fire.”
Later, he hurried into the face and stood at the top of the battalion with “experienced heroism, ” and then attacked a camp cannon unit alone, disposed of three of its members.
On October 4, 1918, Bernard Vann, the respectable and paralegal, was shot by a German sniper — just a month before the end of the war.
“I know that I can never reach what my grandfather did, and this taught me humility, ” said Michael Vann, who was 72 years old.
After a march led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were also reproduced by the memorial.
Michael Vann said that it was an honor to have played a part at the ceremony and added: “There is a real hero’s quest to show how many people will later express their respect. ”
The MMA fans were fed all night to see the Bellator's 206 mediation, instead of getting Peppa pigs.
Imagine the whole night you've been struggling to see the exciting Bellator 206, and the mediation is gone.
The San José show included 13 clashes, and six of them were live in the UK, Channel 5 channels at night.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to fight each other, the English viewers were not surprised by Peppa pigs instead of the game.
A lot of people who stayed up for this conflict for hours in the morning.
Instead of the MMA game, one of the fans secreted a child graphic film on Twitter as a "some kind of sick joke".
“In the sense of the state law, this content cannot be transmitted by the channel at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to child programs,” said Dave Schwarzz, Vice-President of the Bellator Communication and Marketing Department.
- Yeah, it's Peppa, pig time."
Scott Coker, the President of the Bellator company, promised that in the future the schedule of the show would be revised to take account of the United Kingdom's viewers.
“ I think we can solve it by repeating, ” said Coker.
– However, it is 6:00 a.m. in the Sunday, until the Sunday of our time, which is already on Monday, we cannot correct it.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show switched, there were a lot of messages, and most of them weren't very friendly.
First we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix the mistake.
But that's not what we were talking about. We were dealing with a legal problem.
However, I can promise that this will not happen next time.
There are only five matches in the programme instead of six so far – we really wanted to please the viewers, but we were counting on ourselves.
It was an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's sexual orientation with minority complex
Tom Daley's work jumper Olympics said that when he was young, he felt lower than anyone in his youth, because of his sexual attitude, but that's why he motivated him to succeed.
According to the 24 - year - old athlete, he didn’t realize that “not everyone was like him. ”
In his radio program called Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne told the broadcaster that it was for the rights of gays to give others “a hope. ”
He added that since he was a parent, he was much less interested in the Olympics.
For years, Kirsty Young, a permanent programme director of the show, has missed several months because of the disease.
In Laverne’s first show, Daley called as a shipwrecker, said that he felt less than anyone else as young because “he was societally unaccepted when someone loved boys and girls. ”
He said: “To this day, the feeling of subtleness and change is what makes me firm and strong in order to achieve my success. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something ” in order not to disappoint anyone when he found his sexual attitude.
The double Olympic Bronze Jumper became a well-known representative of the LMBT Community, and using his role in national community games this year, Australia, asked the world governments to decriminate homosexuality in several countries.
He said that he spoke in the matter because he felt lucky to live his life openly, without negative consequences, and he wanted to give others “a hope. ”
The three-fold world champion said that “the situation was completely surprising ” when he fell in love with another man, Dustin Lance Black, American filmmaker, who he first met in 2013.
Daley and his 20-year-old Oscar award scenariowriter were married last year, and he claimed that the age difference never had a problem with them.
“ If you go through so much in your youth, ” he said, “when you were 14 years old, and your father died three years later in cancer, someone in your own age finds hard to experience extreme experiences similarly.
In June, the couple adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
“ If they asked me this question last year, I would have said that the most important thing is to win gold coins, ” he said.
There are more important things than my Olympia gold treasure.
"My Olympian gold meadow Robbie."
The child's name was Robert after Daley's father, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he had a brain tumor diagnosis.
According to Daley's statement, his father didn't want to accept that he was going to die, and one of the last questions was whether he had the tickets for the London Olympics in 2012 because he wanted to sit there in the first row.
“I was unwilling to answer to him that ‘Daddy, you are no longer there in the first row’,” he quoted.
“ I had his hand when he stopped breathing, but until the moment I couldn’t accept that my father was not insecure, ” he said.
The following year Daley attended the 2012 Olympics and acquired the bronze.
“I was glad that this is what I've dreamt of my whole life — jumping in front of a local audience in the Olympic Games, and there's no better feeling than that, ” he said.
Heather Small Proud (Byszke) has been very helpful in preparing for the Olympics, and he will still be musked if he hears.
The Desert Island Disc begins on the BBC Radio 4 on Sunday, local time at 11:15.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he was on the board on Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
The American Phil Mickelson can set a record by taking part in the 47th Coupon game on the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he must win his form back if you don't want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson plays a record for 12 times every two years at the event, but because of the performance of Saturday's four balls and game four, the team captain Jim Furyk sent it to the suburbs.
Instead of taking five wins in the big races, the player would be at the center of events as many times when the United States had to fight for the victory, now in one half of the day, he sniffs his team, and the other half is practicing the field and tries to correct the errors that weaken his game.
The top of Karrierje never belonged to the most accurate bats, so the 48-year-old player is not really in the narrow track of Le Golf National, where the high grass has to be paid a very high price for defective hits.
And if the course isn't scary enough for itself, Mickelson will face the exactly playin' English champion Francesco Molinari at the Sunday, nineth game, who won all four of his games this week in the Tommy Fleetwood team.
If the Americans with a four-point challenge before the 12 individual matches start hard, Mickelson's game can be crucial.
Furyk claims he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“He fully knows what role he played in today’s development. He beat my back, folded, and promised that he would be ready for tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
– Extremely confident.
It's one of the biggest, and it's done a lot for the team in the past and in the past week.
Basically, I didn't have two games for him.
I planned more, but in the situation, we decided that this was the best solution.
He wants to be in the field, just like everyone else."
With Mickelson's Sunday role, he's gonna break Nick Faldo's record, and no one's ever played more games on the Ryder Cup.
With this, you can close a series on the Ryder Cup that is far below the performance of the player individually.
Mickelson's 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven infinite for you, but Furyk pointed out that the presence of the veteran player has no tangible advantages for the team.
“ He is funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of others, ” he explained.
– I think the younger players also enjoyed the games against him, and it's good to see that.
His presence is beyond the strictly meaning of the game."
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, is aware that they can easily lose their gains
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone gains significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, it can easily turn his back on him.
The Danish player appeared first at a match in 1997 in Valderram, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point advantage against the Americans, and then at the end they only managed to maintain a hairline advantage for a win of 141⁄2-1331⁄2.
“We must always remind ourselves that we have made a huge advantage in Valderram, but we have only gained one of the hairs, and we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally got out,” said Bjørn in the picture after the 5-3, Friday and yesterday victory of class 2018, leading to 10-6 on Le Golf National.
– We have enough to think about previous years' competitions, and now everyone can see that the game is not over.
You'll have to play with the full force tomorrow.
So come on, and do everything you need to win.
We can't relax until the points are on the board.
We have a goal that is nothing but to win this trophy, and now we just have to focus on that.
As I said earlier, I am most concerned with the 12 players of our team, but we also have to pay attention to the other side, who will happen to be one of the biggest players in the world."
Bjørn, proud of the team’s performance on a difficult track, added: “I would never set predictions in such a situation.
Tomorrow's a whole different pasta.
Then everything depends on individual performances, which is completely different than the team game.
It feels great to play in a couple when things go well, but when you stand out individually, you can see what a golfer you really are.
That's what you need to understand with the players that tomorrow they're bringing the best out of the field.
They're gonna have to get rid of their partner, who's gonna have to make the best of it."
Unlike Bjørn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opponent's team specifically trusts his players to perform more individually than in couples, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who obtained three points from the four.
Furyk personally experienced both sides of the last-day resurrections: He was a member of the winner team in Brookline, and then on the loser side of the European team, after the bravour performance of the "Medinah miracle".
“I remember all the cursed words, ” he answered when they asked him because he encouraged the players before the last day in 1999, team captain Ben Crenshaw.
- We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we're going to go with a quick start, as we could see in Brookline, as we saw in Medinah.
If one of the teams really flips, it puts the opponent's players under huge pressure during the middle games.
Thus, we set up the order and prepared our players so that they could perform a real miracle tomorrow."
Thomas got the job to take the lead in the efforts to turn the job, and Rory McIlroy plays against the first game, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter will be the first half of the European team.
“I have decided in order, because I think it's like this, from the beginning to the end,” added Bjørn to the individual stand.
Once again, the latest German warship has been postponed.
The German Navy's latest Fregat should have been placed in service in 2014 to replace the rising cold-war warships, but due to different system failures and exponentially increasing costs, it would have waited for at least next year.
The flagship of the wild-new Baden-Württemberg class flagship was postponed to the first half of 2019, quoted by Die Zeit Weekly, one of the military speakers.
According to initial plans, the ship should have joined the Navy bond in 2014, but the continued delays made it very difficult for the large-scale project.
In 2007, the Navy ordered the four Baden-Württemberg-class ships to place the frequencies of Brema class.
We understand that it will be equipped with a large-powered canon, and with a variety of air and water vehicle missiles and decoupling technology, including a signal detector that reduces the radar, infrared and acoustic signals of the ship.
Another important feature is that it is rarely needed for maintenance, which in practice means that these latest frequencies can be placed in service for up to two years away from the parent ports.
However, as a result of the continued sliding of the project, these high-tech warships, which Germany could also feel its power overseas, may be obsolete when they are finally set up in service, noted Die Zeit.
The heavy destiny F125 fregatt was placed on the cover last year when the German Navy officially refused to open the vehicle and sent it back to the Hamburg Shipyard Bloohm & Voss.
This was the first time the Navy sent back a ship delivered to the manufacturer.
There was not much information on the causes of return, but the German media have a number of critical "software and hardware errors" that make the warship useless in a battlefield.
Software deficiencies are a very significant problem, as only 120 sailors will serve on Baten-Württemberg-class warships, which is only half the crew of the old Brema-class frequencies.
It has also emerged that the ship is extremely overweight, which will deteriorate its performance and will inevitably make it impossible for the Navy to make further changes later.
The 7000 tonnes ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ is supposed to be twice as difficult as German ships of the same class in the World War II.
Apart from the defective parts, the increase in total project costs, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an amazing EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) amount, while the initial draft accounted for EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new Fregats are particularly important in the light of the warnings that Germany's presence in the sea is detrimental.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the National Defence Committee of the German Parliament, recently acknowledged that the Navy “is beginning to run out of warships with intake. ”
According to the public officials, the problem has become a selfish process in the meantime, since the old ships had to be installed, but there are no more ships to replace the snipers.
He expressed his concern about the fact that none of the Baten-Württemberg Fregats was able to join the Navy's bond.
National Trust is searching for the secret lives of the bats
New research is carried out on a Scottish country property to find out how the bats use the characteristics of the landscape while hunting.
Researchers hope that the results can provide new information on the behaviour of single flying mammals, which may also benefit from future species conservation initiatives.
National Trust for Scotland scientists will look at the behaviour of common and sopranal dwarfs and brown long-tailed bats and aquatic bats in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
In the appropriate points of the area, special reception equipment will be placed so that the bats can be recorded during the season.
And NHS' staff and volunteers will carry out mobile data collection with manual detectors.
A detailed analysis of the recording sound material determines the frequencies of the bat sounds or what the species is doing.
Researchers are also preparing a habitat map and a habitat report, which enables a detailed definition of the behaviour of animals depending on the landscape.
According to Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Protection Advisor, the results will reveal the most important habitats for the bats and how the species uses them.
This information helps to identify the beneficial effects of habitat management works, such as the development of strands, and how the forest areas can be kept best for bats and other species concerned.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of the bat populations has decreased considerably over the last century.
Buildings and terrestrial development work interfere with the animals’ sleep spaces and reduce their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, as is the case with deployed air papers, certain chemical processes used for construction materials, and attacks on domestic cats.
The bats aren't exactly blind.
However, because of the night predator, they rely much more on their hearings when they hunt for a predator than on their vision.
They can determine the exact position of insects and of the terrain that come in their way by their sophisticated techniques based on the reversal of the ultrasound.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, takes the question of bats very seriously.
They work with ten qualified professionals who regularly study and study the place of sleep and take part in rescue work at times.
The organization created the first and only dedicated bat reservoirs of Scotland on the Threave Empire in the Dumfrees and Galloway, which gives eight of the ten bat trees of Scotland home.
According to David Thompson's owner, the area is ideal for bats.
"Here , threave has a great place for bats," he said.
– There are old buildings, many old trees, and everything else that is needed for a good living space.
But we don't know a lot about the bats yet, and thanks to the work in these and other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to do to make themselves feel great."
He also stressed the importance of ensuring that the bats live there before renovating the buildings, as the destruction of a single establishment could lead to 400 female and young individuals, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Defended animals, destroying them, harassing them, and their habitats are forbidden by the law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, also asked for help from the population.
He said: “We still have a lot of things we don’t know about bats and about the situation of most domestic species.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges, lawyers are suing the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo “false news” has kept charges against him of sexual violence, and he believes that others want to use his name to“ get into public knowledge.”
Your football lawyers are ready to sue the German weekly charter, Der Spiegel.
The Portuguese framework member and the battle of Juventus were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
She says the athlete paid him $375,000 to listen to the case, he wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo, a few hours after the accusations came to light, informed his 142 million fan camp of Instagram Live, that the news was a lie.
‘No, no, no, no, no, no.
"The things that I was gathered today are all lies," said the five-fold gold ball player to the camera.
“ They want to use my name to get in public knowledge.
It happens like this.
They want to become famous with my name, that's the life of the public.
I'm a happy man, and my life is fine," he added the player with a smile.
On the basis of the allegations that were called “unacceptable, suspicion of privacy” Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to sue Der Spiegel, says Reuters.
According to Christian Schertz's attorney's statement, the player's claim for compensation is ‘to the extent of the seriousness of the infringement, which is likely to have been one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years’.
The case was reportedly held in June 2009 in one of the suites of the Las Vegas Palms Hotel and Casino.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga are supposed to go up to the sports suite where the man raped the woman anonymously, he stands in the documents filed to the DA Clark County of Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo burst on his knees after the case and told him that he was “in 99 percent good boy, ” except for “one percent. ”
On the basis of the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo acknowledged that he had a sexual relationship with the woman, but he thought it was a joint agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police, and at a hospital, she also made a visual of her injuries, but later she entered into an extraterrestrial agreement because “she was frightened of retaliation ” and“ manifest humiliation. ”
The 34-year-old woman now wishes to repeal the agreement, as the trauma caused by the case in question continues to discourage her life.
Ronaldo was right in front of a validation at the time of the alleged attack (from Real Madrid to Manchester United), and this summer, the Italian giant, Juve, bought the player for 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will “forever regret ” the loss of car factories
The United Kingdom will “forever regret ” after Brexit lose the world leader’s position as a car manufacturer, said Greg Clark, Minister of Business.
He added: “I am concerned about the declaration made by Toyota UK to BBC, according to which, if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, the automotive factory will have to temporarily stop production in the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"There is a need for an agreement," said Clark.
According to the Japanese automotive company, in an unconciliated Brexit, jobs may be lost due to cross-border delays.
The Burnaston factory, Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced 150 000 cars last year, which were exported 90% of them to the other Member States of the European Union.
"I believe that if the United Kingdom falls out of the EU at the end of March, production will be withdrawn in the factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota Burnaston.
Other automotive manufacturers in the United Kingdom (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) were also concerned about the possibility that the country would leave the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW stated that after Brexit, Miniket would close the factory in Oxford for a month.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risk posed by an unanimous Brexit in relation to the supply chain.
Toyota's production line is based on “family time” and components come from suppliers in the United Kingdom and other EU Member States every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom comes out of the EU without agreement on 29 March, cross-border disruptions can lead to production delays and a lack of part.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store sufficient parts in the Derbyshire plant for more than one day, so production should be stopped.
Clark said that the plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, was "precisely compiled to avoid delaying checks at the border".
“We have a need for an agreement. We want an agreement under the best possible conditions, not only to enjoy the fruit of our current successes but also to offer new opportunities,” said BBC Radio 4 Today.
– Not only the Toyota, but also other manufacturers can confirm that we are definitely in need of maintaining our highly successful supply chain."
Toyota could not tell us how long production would last, but it warned that the cost of compensating would cause a long-term distortion of the competitiveness of the factory, which could ultimately lead to a loss of jobs.
According to Peter Tsouvalar, who worked 24 years in the Burnaston plant and is currently engaged in the Unite trade union, trade union members are increasingly concerned: “In my opinion, the jobs that will be lost at this time will never be restored.”
One of the government speakers said: “We have developed a viable and viable plan for future EU relations.”
You can postpone Trump and Rosenstein's meeting again, tell me the White House.
"You can postpone a new week" Rod Rosenstein's Deputy Attorney General and Donald Trump's big meeting, as the debate around the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh continues, published on Sunday by the White House.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Attorney Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian influence on elections, the possible connections between Trump's advisors and the Russian government and the possible obstacles to justice by Trump.
In Washington, for months, they've been wondering if Trump would eventually manage the Deputy Attorney General, thereby jeopardising Mueller's independence.
According to the New York Times this month, Rosenstein considered coming to the meeting on a wire to record the discussion with the President, and the question was whether, on the basis of the 25th constitutional amendment, it would be possible to replace Trump.
Rosenstein denied what he said.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, and the rumour was to submit his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, the United Nations had a presence in New York on Thursday.
Trump said that he would “not welcome” to deal with Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid the hearing of the Senate Justice Commission, where Kavanaugh and a woman who suspected him of sexual wrongdoing, Dr. Christine Blasay Ford, witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation to investigate charges against Kavanaugh, with which the final Senate vote was further delayed.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, has been visiting the Fox News Sunday show.
When they asked about the Rosenstein Summit, she replied: “We have no scheduled date yet, even for this week, but I also see a chance of a further one-week delay in the light of cases in the Supreme Court.
We'll find out soon, and as always, I'll let the press know."
However, some journalists accepted this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
So Chris Wallace asked me about the reason for this.
Sanders replied that the rareness of press releases is not the reason for the behaviour of television reporters as a “sensation shave”, but he added: “I do not dispute the fact that they are really sensational.”
It then indicated that direct meetings between Trump and the media would take place more often.
“The President gives more questions and questions than any previous president,” he said. He added even without supporting the claim: “We looked after the numbers.”
Press releases will continue, said Sanders, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is better to talk to me in light years.
We are often trying to find this and there have been many of these occasions in the past few weeks so that they can speak personally with the President of the United States instead of the White House Press."
Trump will regularly answer the questions of the reporters when he leaves the White House, or he will attend public events, or perhaps press conferences with the dignity you see here.
However, the press conferences held alone are very rare.
Why, perhaps it is possible to conclude from what happened this week when the President produces a bizarre role in New York, wherever he is, in front of the gathered journalists.
The head of the healthcare wall sent a letter to NHS Scotland workers in the EU about Brexit’s concerns
The head of the health wall expressed the country's gratitude by letter to the staff from the Scottish NHS from the countries of the European Union and pointed out that he hoped to remain after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom expected to leave.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of applications for decentralised public service citizens in the EU.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit continued during the summer, which is expected to take a decision in the fall.
The Government of the United Kingdom has also undertaken to prepare a scenario without any agreement.
I am aware of the fact that this may be an alarming period for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of the country they originate.
Employees from different EU countries and other countries have valuable experience and expertise to help the work of a health wallet, which also has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, too, and we really want you to stay with us."
Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he had a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, had an emergency surgery after having suffered a head wound from Mike Organ Tennessee on Saturday, a 31-27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores.
The head of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, said to the journalists, that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
"She went to the beach line, and it just crashed," said Reed.
The training team and the health personnel first gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side of the track, then put it on a bear and took it to further investigations.
A member of Tennessee State in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris, the reporter of the WSMV that Abercrombie was over the surgery performed at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “for now, he does not know more details about the type and extent of injury,” while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the second-year student who rested for one year, spends his first season in Tennessee State team, where he's transferred from Illinois.
On Saturday, he presented a total of five successful equipment before he left the field, so he's at 18 in the season.
Foreign customers will have to pay higher taxes on property purchased in the United Kingdom
According to the new Toryk plan, foreign customers will have to pay higher taxes on property purchased in the United Kingdom and support homeless people with additional revenues.
With this step, I would neutralise the success of Corbyn's young voters
The increase of the tax is intended for those who do not tax in the United Kingdom
According to the State Prize, this would amount to a total of 120 million pounds per year, which would be used to support the homeless.
Foreign customers will have to pay higher fees for property purchased in the United Kingdom, and the extra revenue from this will be used to support homeless people, will be made to report Theresa May at a press conference today.
The aim of this step is probably to offset the successes of Jeremy Corbyn among young voters, which he has achieved by making promises for more affordable housing and measures for high-income people.
The increase of the tax will affect individuals and companies not taxing the United Kingdom, and the extra revenue from this will be used to fight homelessness.
The additional charge to be charged to the current tax, which is to be charged over the higher taxes on the second dwellings and property purchased for expenditure two years ago, to up to three percent.
The State reserve is estimated at 120 million pounds per year following the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of the newly built real estates in London are purchased by non-UK nationals, causing significant price increases, resulting in an increasingly difficult situation for first house purchasers.
Many of the land’s wealthy districts became “a spirit city”, especially in the capital, as many foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new draft law came only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in taxes to help young people who were ready to wait for their first home.
He personally believes that construction companies are responsible for the high maintenance of real estate prices, which have become the habit of buying and leaving the land on the parlour. He asked May to cancel the quotas for affordable houses and to start something with the "indigenous situation in the residential market".
Corbyn has made remarkable proposals for the series of housing reforms, including rent control and the elimination of thoroughly unfounded immigrations.
In addition, it would provide more powers and opportunities for advice to build new houses.
May said: “I said last year that my Prime Minister would like to sanctify the restoration of the English dream and that life should be better for each generation.
To this end, the real estate market situation needs to be settled.
Britain continues, as always, to be open to those who want to live here, work and start a family.
However, it is not right for individuals living outside the country and companies of foreign interest to buy real estate as easily as hard-working citizens in England.
Dreams from their own home have become almost unaccompanied for too many, and the unworthy state of homelessness was too accessible."
Jack Ross: "I want to be the manager of the Scottish team"
According to Jack Ross, Sunderland’s coach, “the main desire ” is to be the manager of the Scottish national team once.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would be happy to take the challenges of the resurrection of the North East Club, which is currently in the third place of the First Class League, leaving only three points behind the first position.
Then he transferred his seat to the stadium of Light, which was baptized to the Stadium of Light, after the last season the St. Mirren team successfully returned to the first-class Scotch football championship.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
Unfortunately, I was only able to enter the reserves, said Ross in his Scottish BBC Sportsound program.
– When I was a child, I watched a lot of Scotch team games in Hampden with my father, and something always pulled back to them.
Now, however, I have only a chance to succeed as a club manager."
There are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio on the post of the Sunderland manager.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic isn't worried about the need to press such big names, and earlier he rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town offer.
“I am assessing the success at the moment to see if I can get the team back to the first class.
If we buy the structure and facilities of the club, it will certainly be the place of the first-class league," he said.
– It won't be easy to get back, but it's more likely that I'm only going to see my activity here as a success if I get the club back."
Ross's career started just three years ago, after a while as an adjunct coach on the Dumbarton team and spent 15 months at the Hearts Coach.
Then Aolla helped to get on her feet after the team fell back in the third class and received the title of championship with St. Mirren on the edge of the fall in the next season.
Ross says he feels more confident now than ever during his player's career, either at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkir, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academy.
“A true moment was a decisive moment, ” recalled the period spent as Alloa’s coach.
– I clearly thought that management was more like me than being a player.
That sounds weird because I've done a good job, I've had a very good life of it, and I've had a few really memorable moments.
However, the lives of players are sometimes very hard.
There's a lot to go through every blessed week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of the work, but the management tasks lie to me.
I've always been interested in management, and now that I've tasted it, I've been feeling the best in my skin when I was a grown-up."

According to a study, at 5:30 a.m., the best drops in beer.
In the summer heat wave, there has been a significant increase in the traffic of pubs in England in difficult situations, but the restaurant chains are still under great pressure.
Based on the data collected, pubs and bars' revenues increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurants had a decrease of 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant of the CGA, comprising statistics, said: “The trend of the previous month, when pubs experienced an increase in income of 2.8%, has continued in July due to the sunshine period and the longer than was expected by England.
The decline in revenue of the restaurants in June has worsened by 1.8% in July.
Pubs and bars, mostly selling alcohol, did the best to produce more than even more than a restaurant drop.
Even pubs offering food were unpleasantly affected by lasting sunshine, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people prefer to drink at this time.
The income of pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month, while food revenue fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, an RSM analysis in the field of leisure and restaurants, says: “These results follow the trend that has been drawn since the end of April.
The weather, as well as the most significant Community and sports events, continue to be the main income factor for the entertainment and hosting industry.
It is not surprising that the restaurant chains are in a difficult situation and a reduction in annual income of 4.8% can become particularly painful due to constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer for restaurant operators could not have come at a worse time, and it will only find out in time whether the moderate weather in August will bring relief in this area."
The total income increase in pubs and restaurants was 2.7% in July, with the exception of newly opened places, reflecting the slow cycle of the introduction of new brands.

A child of five has social media books that he hides from his parents
One survey shows that one of five children (although at 11 years of age) has social media books that you hide from your parents and teachers
According to an survey conducted by 20 000 high school students, the number of “Insta Sites” is increasing
News increases fear of sharing sexual content
20% of students responded that they have a "head" account that their parents can see
One out of five creates a social media account (although at 11 years of age) that you hide from adults.
According to an survey conducted by 20 000 high school students, the number of Insta-alcohols is rapidly increasing, which refers to the Instagram photo-sharing page.
The news leads to increased fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of the students responded that they have an unprecedented "principal" account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally found her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret side, found a teenager’s profile on which she said to “ rape me. ”
According to the research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Directors and Directors of independent schools Headmasters’ and Headmasters’ Conference (HMC), 40% of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and 50% acknowledged that they have private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel that they need to create an online space where parents and teachers can't reach them”, said the head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of sporters" at the Scottish Atletic Alliance
Eilidh Doyle was elected not to be the Managing Director of the Scottish Atletic Alliance at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most effective athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, Chairman of the Board, believes that sport decision-makers will be incredibly assisted by the broad international experience gained over the past decade.
“Eilish is a huge honor in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the international atletic community, and its presence will help the development of Scottish atletics”, said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am glad to be the voice of the atlets, and I hope I can really help the Scottish sports leaders.”

Thank you for all the encouraging messages."
A breast-engine promotion similar to mother cows shares the online community
A high-speed online debate was raised by a company producing breast-supplyers, which compared breast-feeding mothers to head-stage steaks.
According to Elvie, “the world’s first quiet, worn breast-sucker, ” was developed in an ironic advertisement that quoted music videos, which presented the freedom that the device gives to the mothers who chew their milk.
Four real mothers are dancing in a cow stand full of salmon, while the texts of the following lines in the background can be heard: "Yes, I am going to chop myself, I don't even have a dick" and "If I hadn't noticed, these aren't cows but my breasts."
And the refrene says: “I am pumping, pumping that the child eats big ones, pumping, pumping, cooking the chicks.”
The advertisement published on Facebook page of the company was soon crossed by online disputes.
The video received 77 000 views, and hundreds of comments on mixed receptions were received. Many say that advertising is a joke from the “bars of the dairy industry”.
“Promoting the product with very tasty cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only if they give life, but their calves are taken away from them within days," recalls one commentant.
Elvie can be placed discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment says: “Yes, it is terrible for the mother and the calve.
But why don't we use them to sell boobs to mothers who can keep their child?"
Someone else added: “A full display of insensitive advertising.”
Others came to protect advertising, and a woman confessed that the video was considered to be “horribly funny. ”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would've bought it right if I were still breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not even trying to see it again.
The product is brilliant", wrote.
Another commenter says: “This is a funny advertisement for mothers who have milk at their workplace or in a bathroom who feel “worked. ”
It is not glorified or judged by the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show you that during the dance, they had the discreet breast-sucker in their bra.
The campaign builds on the feeling that women using breasts sometimes feel like cows.
Elvie Pump, however, is quiet, does not use wires and pipes, can be placed discreetly in a breast-feeding bra so that women can move freely, hold their children in hand or even move out during breast-absorbing.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and communication director of Mother, says: “Elvie Pump was a revolutionary product, and therefore it had to be published in a bold, provocative way.
We wanted to draw attention to the challenges faced by the use of breast smokers and to make a funny sense of what freedom our breast-sucker offers in comparison with this."
Elvie's breast-sucker didn't get into the news for the first time.
In London's fashion week, Marta Jakubowski was dressed by a two-children mother while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants of childhood were transferred secretly to a tent camp at the Texas border.
There is a record of the number of child-age migrants in custody, while the number of monthly crossings has not changed. This partly explains that the harsh rhetoric of the Trump Administration and its actions have made it difficult to find more host homes for them.
Adopters are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that they would worsen their chances of staying in the country if they were to apply for children.
This threat increased in June when it was announced that parents applying for the host and adults living in a household should give fingerprints and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Master of Immigration and Customs Office) in his statement to the Congress last week, acknowledged that dozens of people were arrested for admission to minors who arrived without a escort.
The office later confirmed that 70% of the arrested persons were unpunished.
“80% of the applicants and their households are illegally staying in the country, and a large proportion of them are convicted criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to look for such individuals," said Albence.
In order to speed up the child-related procedure, new rules have been introduced that a part of them should appear before the court within one month of arrest instead of the 60 days so far, and that social workers will make it possible.
Many people will enter the court by video conference call rather than apply for a residence permit.
If the judge doesn't give legal protection, the immigrant will be expelled quickly.
In recent months, social workers and system workers have reported that the longer it takes to be in custody, the more nervous and depressed the children will be, and the greater the chances of violent outbreaks or attempts to escape.
According to legalists, these risks are only increased by a larger facility similar to those of the towers, where the number of children is more difficult to absorb those who need psychological care.
They added that if children were not given enough time to prepare themselves or to say goodbye to friends before they were moved to such a facility, they would put them into even more trauma.
Syria called for an immediate departure from the American, French and Turkish “invasive forces”
Despite the eighth year of the civil war in the country, the speaker of the UN General Assembly, Walid al-Moualem, asked the Syrian refugees to return to their country.
Moualem, also a Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign warriors illegally entered the Syrian territory, referring to the fight against terrorism, and "so they will be treated."
“They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem proved that “the war against terror is about to end” in Syria, where over 360 000 have since 2011 lost their lives and millions of people have been forced to leave their homes.
He declared that Damascus “will continue his holy battle to cleanse the entire territory of Syria” from terrorist groups and “unlawful foreign presence.”
The 2000 U.S. soldiers are in Syria, and the majority of them assist the Kurdish forces as a trainer and a consultant and the Arab militia fighting Bassar el-Assad.
France sent over 1,000 soldiers to the country that was hit by war.
With regard to refugees, Moualem claimed that the conditions for their return were appropriate and that only “one Western country” would encourage “irrational fears” by scaring refugees from returning.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the people return,” he declared.
"Politics were made from a pure humanitarian question."
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and his opponents on the end of the war.
According to UN diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, creating a conflict zone for the last great uprising of the uprising, around Idlib, could contribute to further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish bargain prevented the Syrian government forces supported by the Russians from launching a wide-ranging attack on the three-million resident province.
At the same time, Mr Moualem stressed that the agreement sets out “light deadlines” and indicated his hope that military operations would only be jihadists, including an-Nustra Front, linked to Al-Caida, and that it would have to be "withdrawn".
Ambassador Staffan de Mistura of the United Nations hopes that soon a committee of officials from the government and opposition will be convened, which is responsible for preparing the Syrical Constitution after the war and preparing the elections.
Among the conditions of Moualem, the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, such as “review of certain articles of the current Constitution”, is acceptable and protects all external actors from interference in the process.
That's why they're gonna re-elect Trump.
Following this logic, Trump will certainly be re-elected in 2020, unless the hopes of many liberal viewers have come true and will not put an end to a liability procedure before a scandal.
We can be sure that this would be “the most dramatic presidential final of all times. ”
For now, however, the audience enjoys the show.
Since 2014, the CNN’s main programme-time rating has increased to 1,05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled its rating to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen's data, Fox News is an average attraction of 2.4 million people in the main programme instead of 1.7 million years ago, and the most visible cable TV show on the MSNBC is with its 3.5 million audience, which takes place in the evenings of the most important news.
“We are attracted to us as a fire because something we do not understand” said Neal Baer, leading producer of the drama series of ABC’s appointed survivor. In this series, a low-ranked minima of the cabinet is sitting in the presidential chair after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell's veteran poet, the author of the Just the Funny Parts: And the Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, is different.
This quotes a taxi route in Boston before the 2016 election:
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why," she asked Scovell.
"Because he laughed," the driver answered.
It's the fun force of chaos.
In contrast to television series, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases similar to Roe v Wade presentations to reunite immigrant families and the stability of the world economy.
There's only a very narrow layer you can do to avoid taking care of these facts.
However, it is no longer part of the responsible information when we've been staring at a debate show that is about the authenticity of anonymous background talks used in the book of Bob Woodward’s Woodward, or Paul Manafort’s 15 thousand-dollar strippers jacket (the dressing of arrogance in the body, according to The Washington Post) or the consequences of his description of Stormy Daniels Trump, uhm, anatomy.
What I used to do is that I'll always think of Super Mario from now on.
“He has a little feeling like watching a reality show where we get some new news every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, who is the author of the “Play Stars”. Trump’s show is always changing and the new rounds are coming every day (in N.F.L., he begins to glorify Kim Dzongunt).
If you miss one part, you'll miss it right away.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant, 26-degree, sunny time in Kauain, he was still in his house looking at the MSNBC while holding his CNN show.
He couldn't break away from the TV as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate Justice Committee, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was.
“ I remember when we made those crazy shows, ” said Fleiss, “this was the beginning of the end for Western civilization.
- I thought they were joking, but it seems they were right."
Amy Chozick, who writes to The Times on business, political and media topics, is the author of the Chasing Hillary.
Both parties are throwing money into the hardest competitions of the mid-term Congress election.
No one was surprised that in the 17th constituent district of Pennsylvania both parties would spend the money uncalculatedly after two active MEPs struggled for the same chair after the reconstruction of the Congressures.
One of the contestants for the newly re-established pre-circumcision district of Pittsburgh is the Democratic Conor Lamb, who has obtained an interim election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, the Republican Keith Rothfus is currently a representative of the former 12 constituent district of Pennsylvania, which shows a significant overlap with today's 17th district.
The map had to be rewritten after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania found in January that the previous districts were manipulated to the advantage of the Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the two parties' funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) have almost joined each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after he won a close competition in the March interim election in the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, his seat belonged to the Republicans, and Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have something better chances of winning.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador for China's support and then stopped the plan
According to diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama were already on the side of Beijing, which Washington barely responded to.
In June 2017, Donald Trump negotiated in a good mood with President Juan Carlos Varela Panama and had a hotel in Panama, until his partners pushed out the Trump Organization's leadership team.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called back the main staff of the American departments from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for their “contemporary decision that they do not support Taiwan” earlier announced Heather Nauer, the spokesman of the Ministry.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received approximately 140 million US aid in 2017, including the fight against drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would have been painfully affected by the Central American country, where the unemployment and murder rates were extremely high.
As closed meetings continued, the North and Central American competent authorities postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been the continuation of a similar meeting last year and had the primary objective of reducing migration to the United States.
In the mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration have made it clear that I would like to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they do not want to punish El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence also spoke at the conference scheduled for mid-October, which, according to the diplomats, is a clear indication of the importance of this event by the administration.
The three American consignors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue condemnations and no criminal measures.
John Bolton's White Housewriter did not want to comment on the details of the debate, which were reported anonymously by the three American officials, including two diplomats.
They were also supported by external analysts close to the administration, who were only willing to speak anonymously.
Historical experience
The next strike may be a report by Special Attorney Robert Mueller, who will examine whether Trump has been able to obstruct justice in some way... and all the facts that have been published indicate that.
Mueller's investigation should also cover whether Trump's team cooperated with Russia trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats come to the majority of the Congress, they will certainly try to take responsibility for Trump, who may have to face the judgment of politicians after the voters.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain issues, and the fall of Trump is far from inevitable, even as it is of European principles.
There must be serious decisions on both sides of the Atlantic – it depends on how long the fight will take.
In 1938, a number of German officers were ready to kiss Hitler, waiting for the West to be with the Czech Slovaks in Munich.
The aid has failed, so it has not been possible to prevent the subsequent years of bloodshed.
At similar historical turning points, the inevitable development of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
In today's America, we can identify a number of such turning points.
What are we gonna do if Trump replaced the Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been struggling since last year when, as our newspaper reported, he proposed to record discussions with the president and he called upon Trump to carry out his incompetent office.
Rosenstein says The Times has reported the events inaccurately.
“How will we respond if the F.B.I. study against Brett Kavanaugh is prerogatively or incomplete and is appointed to the Supreme Court despite a credible suspicion of sexual harassment?
And the most important question is, are we voting at the interim election for a Congress that is ready to take responsibility for Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will see a long winter.
I trust that it will not be, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once sat in the building serving my ambassador’s home.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she asked me to light candles on the table with the symbol of Swash at the time of Sabbath.
How can I be a pessimist with this cultural heritage in our future?"

Graham Dorrans at Rangers before the Rapid Vienna game
Rangers welcomes Rapid Vienna on Thursday. The victory against Austria can ensure their participation in the Group of Europe League G after the unanticipated Spanish Villarreal.
Graham Dorrans' knee injury in the middle court was unable to enter the season until the game 2-2 against Villarreal, but he feels that, building on this result, Rangers can also designate greater goals for himself.
“The key point was a great team against Villarreal, ” said the 31-year-old player.
– We believed that we were able to get points, and we brought a point.
Maybe we could have pulled another goal at the end, but we can't complain about the indefinite.
In the first half, they were better, and we connected them to it in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy because they were good enough at their previous game, but our fans behind our backs will certainly have the strength to win.
Last year was pretty hard, I got hurt, there was a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
Our team is good, the guys enjoy the game, the exercises go well.
I hope that if we give everything in it, we can leave the previous season behind and achieve good results."
Many women are concerned about not saving enough for their age
Those who participated in the survey had a precise idea of the age - care they wanted, but only a small part of them talked about it with their family members.
According to the Nationalwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed the expected cost of their elderly care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them responded to talking to their children about this.
"Everybody wants a family member to take care of them, but they don't usually raise the subject," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Business.
The following should be done.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and children: You cannot expect them to take proper care of you if you do not tell them in time what your needs are.
You and your consultant and family will choose where and to what kind of care you want; these decisions will have a significant impact on future costs.
Get a financial advisor: he can give you useful ideas about how to pay for the planned care.
Financing can be done with a traditional insurance bond designed for old-age care, or a hybrid life savings insurance that can cover the expenses or use its own assets as collateral... if you have enough resources for it.
Prepare the legal documentation: This way they will cut off the possibility of a later trial.
Trust a representative, a trustworthy person who works on your behalf in health matters, supervises medical care, and ensures that everything is done according to your expectations even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone with his finances.
This reliable person will make the necessary financial decisions and ensure the payment of accounts when you are unable to do so.
Remember the small details: Let’s say that your elderly parents have been in medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about your medication and allergy?
Please record these data in writing in order to be available at any time.
Martin added: “It is not just financial issues that need to be clarified, it is no matter who your doctor is.”
“What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Everything must be planned in advance."

Earth creeks and fountains in Indonesia
At least 384 of them lost their lives when a massive earthquake on Friday, and then a fountain hit the town of Palu in Indonesia.
The region's communications network has also been damaged, so no news has been received from the government of Donggala north of Palu, where it was the center of the earthquake of 7.5 strength.
There were more than 16 000 people to evacuate.
Some important data are available on the island of Celebes and Donggala:
The main city of Palu Central Celebes, on the west coast of the island of Celebes, was built at the end of a narrow bay, the estimated population was 379 800 in 2017.
He celebrated the 40th anniversary of the founding of the city when the earthquake and the fountain hit him.
The government of Donggala is located more than 300 kilometres northwest of the island of Celebes.
The government population — less than the administrative region — was about 299 200 people in 2017.
Central Celesz is primarily characterised by fisheries and agriculture, especially in the Donggala coasts.
Nickel mining is one of the important sectors of the economy, but it is concentrated mainly in Morowali on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Defence Agency, Palut and Donggala have been fled several times in the last 100 years.
A 1938 runaway killed over 200 inhabitants and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a fountain arrived in West Donggala, and nine of them died.
Indonesia is located in the area of the earthly active Pacific Fire Ring, so earthquakes are common.
Only a few of the major earthquakes and fountains of the past years:
2004: On 26 December, a huge sea crash began at the west coast of the North Sumatra Province of Aceh, which launched a fountain reaching 14 countries, demanding a total of 226 000 lives along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of the victims lost their lives in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong twists shaken the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near Sumatra.
2006: A strong turbulence of 6.8 shattered the southern part of the largest island of Indonesia, and the fountain on the south coast demanded almost 700 victims.

Federal prosecutors have requested a death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City.
New York's federal prosecutors are requesting a death penalty to Sayfulloo Saipov, a suspect of eight human lives in New York City, who has not been executed in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov was accused of driving a truck hired from Home Depot on a bicycle road in the street of Lower-Manhattan West Side Highway, driving a number of pedestrians and bikers.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov “deliberately” killed eight of his victims and was “indeliberately” injuries, indicating the office of the Southern District of New York Attorney.
According to the document submitted, proof of any of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with 22 crimes, including eight-range blackmail murders, almost exclusively used to destroy and destroy organised crime and motorised vehicles.
The attack “required for major planning and forensic intentions” claimed by the prosecutors, and, according to Saipov, it has carried out its actions in a “horrific, cruel, inhuman” way.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused pain and loss to the family of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco”.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's Southern District last decade has requested a death penalty for a defendant.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to murder two drug dealers, but in September 2009, he was sentenced to life sentences.
In the New York Federal case, last year in 1953, a death sentence was executed in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple was sentenced two years earlier for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenberg was executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has not shown any regret in the days and months after the attack.
During the interrogation, he said he was happy to have done it.
Saipov said that the ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea of the attack, he's in charge.
According to the police, he asked me to set up an ISIS trainer in his hospital room.
All 22 charges for being innocent.
David Patton, a member of the State Defense of Saipov, said that they “reasonably disappointed ” in the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the actual liberty of life in prison would have been more favourable for the confession of confession, and that the death penalty would only extend the suffering of all the actors involved," says Patton.
Saipov's defenses earlier asked the prosecutors not to request a death penalty for their defendant.
A representative of Tory said that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage stated at a demonstration held at the Tory Conference that he called the army of the people into battle.
According to the former Head of Umip, politicians need to feel pressure on Eurosceptics after a party of Theresa May called on Farage to be entrusted to negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Peter Bone, who was not in charge of any office, told the participants of the Birmingham meeting that the United Kingdom would ‘ have left long ago’ if Farage was the Minister of Brexit Affairs.
It's a good characteristic of the pressure on May in the party that the residual Toryks spoke at another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers plan, which calls for permanent establishment between the Brexit and the rest parties and the EU.
According to his allies, despite the negative reactions, he tries to reach an agreement with Brussels so that Eurosceptics and the Labour Party can only choose from his package or from the “full chaos”.
In the protest on Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone said that the “Chequers film” had to be compiled.
He suggested that Farage should be brought to the House of the Lords and that it should be entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were to lead the negotiations, we would have quit," he said.
The representative of Wellingborough added: “I stand by the Brexit, but I have to count on Chequers.”
By criticizing the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servants of others.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone has rejected the assumption that the public mood has changed since the 2016 vote: “There is no real basis for the British people to change their views and want to stay."
Andrea Jenkyns, representative of the Brexit Party Tory, also attended the meeting and said to the journalists: “Just so much I ask: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people’s voices.
The Chequers deal is rejected by the public opinion, the opposition will not vote, it is unfamiliar among parties, and especially among the activists who work in the field and helped us get to the government.
Forget the Chequers deal and listen to us."
He added: “Only the Prime Minister who keeps his word can hold his chair.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians “move to know the pressure ” to avoid betraying the results of the 2016 referendum.
“ Trust between us, or between the people and our politicians, has now declared the bet.
– They want to sell Brexit, and today we're gathered together to send it, we're not gonna let it happen."
With these words, he turned to the enthusiastic crowd: “I would like that if our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, felt pressure.
We call on the people's army to win the Brexit and not rest until the United Kingdom is re-established into an independent, proud country."
During this time, the residual parties drew up in Birmingham, and then held a two - hour meeting in the city center.
Some activists were flying the flag of the "Toryk against the Brexit" movement this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party has been active in the Conservatives as a result of the security errors occurring at the opening of the conference.
“These people said that they had an IT background for a Canadian-plus-plus agreement, a cross-border transition and a free trade agreement with Ireland without borders,” he added.
- They're just talking about it.
It's just that Brexit's not good," he emphasised.
Warren “reasons carefully” to launch the Presidency

The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was a meeting with the electoral citizens in the 36th public forum since Trump took office.
A participant asked if he was planning to leave the presidential election.
In Warren’s reply, he said that it was time for women to “take a part in the restoration of the misleading government in Washington, including the taking of the supreme position”.

Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton is closer to the world championship address after gaining the victory before Sebastian Vettel
After Valtteri Bottas qualified himself to a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it immediately became clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team will play a big role on my run.
It's not the one that started the position, Battas, and he almost got Hamilton in trouble because he defended his position on the first two rounds, which enabled Vettel to attack his teammate.
First, he stood in the box with Vet and let Hamilton be stuck in the traffic behind the middle field, which should have proved to be decisive.
Mercedes took a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton was provoked after a close operation, during which Ferrari's pilot left the inner arc free after two moves as a defense in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the bars, and at the end of the first round, it was the seventh.
He then drove most of the race because he didn't change tyres so he could quickly reach a target and prevent Kimi Räikkonen in the hope of the fourth place.
Finally, on the 44th round, he was in the box, but on the remaining eight circles he could not increase his pace, so Raikkonene became the fourth place.
“ It was a difficult day because Valteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was ordered to let go.
The team has done an exceptional job to get the first two seats," said Hamilton.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump made a joke on Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday meeting because the senator insisted that he didn't leak Christine Blasay Ford's letter, who charged sexual harassment to Brett Kavanaugh as a new member of the Supreme Court.
At the meeting in Western Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but noted that the things in the Senate prove that people are “faithful, hatred and liars. ”
“ What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the past few days when you see anger when you see that people are angry, fierce, hatred and lying, ” he said.
“ If we look at the statements and leaks, they say, ‘ oh, that wasn’t me.
That wasn't me.”
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... You leaked the document? — ‘Ooh, what is it?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.”
Well, let's stop for a second.
We leaked?... no, we didn't leak," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent the letter to Feinstein in July in detail on the charges against Kavanaugh, and the letter leaked out at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the source of leaking would have been his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims and leak his story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill's report.
"The doctor asked me to treat him confidentially and treated him confidentially as requested."
However, it seems that his denial was not accepted by the president who noted at the Saturday evening meeting: “I tell you what's going on: his body speech was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it out, but that was the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by the three women by using the alleged charges for their own purposes.
“ They are determined to take whatever means, but they will get power back.
You can see the wickedness, the hatred, they don't care who they're hurt, who they're going through to get power and control," quoted the President's words by Mediaite.

Another black one?
New York's nanda sued a party for dismissing after a "rassist" message
A young lady in New York brought a complaint about the release of a couple against discrimination after the mother complained that they had been able to use “a black woman ” in a message sent her wrongly.
The couple denies that they would be racist, and the case is similar to “pression. ”
The two-child mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was disappointed when she found that the woman was black on the first working day of the arrival of Giselle Maurice in 2016.
“ I NEED TO THINK YOUR FLAXMAN!", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to your husband in a text message.
But instead of her husband, she sent her message to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after he realized that he was in the fight, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “unconscious” released Ms. Maurice, claiming that the departing nurse, who was a African-American, did a bad job, and was expecting a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid a day's job, and then sent home with a Uber.
Maurice now appeals to the party for resignation, and asks for 350 dollars a day to be reimbursed for the inland work for a six-month period, which was initially hired, although without contract.
“I want to show them how to stop the journey, you can't do that,” he said to the Post on Friday, adding: “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations accused of racism that the suspension of Maurice was reasonable because they were afraid that they could not trust him after he was violated.
“ My wife sent her something she didn’t mean.
He's not racist.
We are not racist," said the husband, Joel Plasco to the Post.
“ But would you trust your children to someone who, even if it was accidentally, was rude?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Plasco, similar to the case, said that his wife had a baby only two months ago, and he was “in a very difficult situation. ”
"Will anyone attack this kind of thing?
It's not really nice to do that," he added the investment banker.
While there is a legal procedure, the public court has already quickly condemned the party in the community media, damaged their behaviour and their logic.
According to a recent letter, the publisher of Paddington was afraid that the readers would not be able to bind to a speaking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said about the letter: “It is easy for someone to replace himself with someone who first reads before she was published.
This information is quite entertaining now that we know what a great success Paddington is."
According to her, her father, who worked as the opera of the BBC before she was inspired to write a baby book about a little game bear, would not have been inconvenient if she had been rejected, and then added that the 60th anniversary of the book was incredibly successful after her father died last year.
Paddington called him “a very important member of their family ” and added that his father was very proud of his final success.
“ He was a very quiet man, and he was not imaginated at all, ” he said.
“ But since Paddington was almost real for him, he was like a child who brought him to something: we are proud of him even if it isn’t ours.
I think he saw Paddington's success somehow.
Although he created it, and he came out of his imagination, he always owed it to himself as the reward of Paddington."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
When he landed, his daughter and his daughter were rushing to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nizza, where the doctors fought for nothing.
“ They regularly called to tell me that she was in a very bad condition and that she was not expected to survive, ” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“And then I got a call from Nad, saying that my daughter will die in the next two minutes, and I have to say thank you.
I said goodbye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication that the doctors gave him to keep his heart dripping, was slowly consumed and then left his body.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait to know that it was all over.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, dying of the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane together with the others who didn't care about the trial she was through.
"None knew," he said.
“ I threw my head down, and all the time my tears flipped.
It's hard to explain, but on that plane, I felt this overwhelming sympathy for Nadia.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew you loved my daughter so much."
Photographs with mourning women to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide work to prevent them from throwing away their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put up postcards full of inspiring messages and emergency numbers on a Welsh Bridge.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he was depressed and then committed suicide when he was 18.
“ I don’t want any parent to feel the same thing I feel every day, ” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, told me that her son was a promising cook, and she was stuck on everyone.
“He knew everyone's smiles.
They always said his smile was throwing any place up."
But before he died, he gave up his work because he was in a very bad condition."
Tyler, who ended his life by himself, was found by his 11-year-old brother.
Ms Davis said: “I was constantly concerned that this would cause some domino effect.”
Ms. David prepared the postcards for the purpose of “so that people know that there are people who can be searched and talked to, even if it is just a friend.
Don't sit quietly, you need to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has lost Mark, Ms. Davies' girlfriend for years, who was a 15-year-old partner, not long after the death of the male mother.
“ He didn’t say he was depressed, depressed or anything, ” he said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in your attitude.
He was completely underneath on Christmas Day: when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look into their eyes and these things."
He said that his death was a tremendous trauma for them, but they have to deal with: “He left great space in the family.
He broke our hearts in small pieces.
But we have to keep fighting."

Questionary Brett Kavanaugh's future, as the FBI starts an investigation.
"I thought that if we succeeded in achieving what he asked, a limited-time investigation, perhaps we can agree," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that the committee was holding the party from falling into pieces because of the inability to decide.
Why were Mr Kavanaugh and the Republican supporters opposed to the FBI investigation?
Their opposition is due only to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected to not perform well, it will be much harder for them to bring their people to the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby with Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and he also met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases his report?
There is a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive the minimum of 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to make a decision so that Mr Kavanaugh can be entered in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean dissidents "reduced" under Kim's control
The number of North Korean dissidents to South Korea has declined since Kim Jzongun had been powered seven years ago, he declared a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Bjangs quoted the data of the South Ministry of Consolidation and said that last year he had 1127 dissidents against 2011 when this number was 2706.
Park said that the tighter border guards between North Korea and China, as well as the human smugglers, were the main causes.
Phenjan did not comment on this information in public.
Most of the North Dissidents eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30.000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most of them flee to China, which has the longest border to North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitated Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
People who are dissidents from China are illegal immigrants and do not accept them as refugees and often send them back with violence.
The relationship between North and South, which is practically still in war, has improved considerably over the past months.
At the beginning of the month, the leader of the two countries met in Phenjan, at the heart of their discussions, the ongoing nuclear dismantling negotiations.
This historic meeting in June took place between President Donald Trump and President Kim Jzongun in Singapore, where further cooperation with the nuclear-free Korean peninsula was largely agreed.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed the American sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of trust in the Americans, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unanimously disarm our weapons," said Ri in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh as “historical” to say that he found it inappropriate to the Supreme Court.
The minority president of the House, Nancy Pelosi, named Brett Kavanaugh as “historic” to the Supreme Court and claimed that his behaviour was not in line with the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I was unintended to think that if a woman were to act like this, I would call it "historian," she explained Pelosi's reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh's emotional objection against rumors that he would have sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasay Ford in their teenage.
In his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and his voice closed when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
In addition, he expressly condemned the Democrats of the Committee, calling the charges against him "grotesk and coordinated character murder", and the defeat of Hillary Clinton in 2016 was organised by aggressive liberals.
Pelosi told me that he thought Kavanaugh's behavior proved that he was not fit to work at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I believe that he has ruled out himself with his statements and the behavior he has shown against the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether he would try to take charge of Kavanaugh, in the event of filling the post and obtaining the majority of the Democrats in the House.
"I say so that if you don't tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, it's not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court where it is right now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently in a court of law at the Supreme Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, he is concerned about the possible decisions made by Kavanaugh about the law on affordable benefits or the case Roe v Wade, as Kavanugh is a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh's hearings, he ignored the questions about whether he would reconsider the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“ There is no time for a hysterical, perpetrated person to be among the members of the court, and he expects us to fly away from joy, ” said Pelosi.
And the women have to take care of it.
It's a legitimate burst, months and years of rage that has grown up on the surface, and can't turn it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so rare, do I?"
“ I was helped by a woman who worked in a leading position somewhere, ” she continued. “ She told me that she was in her anger, but she developed a technique according to which, when she started crying in anger, she said to her chatter: ‘I may think you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry.”
And then he kept going.
And I thought it was a great idea."
Partly, tears are seen as a sign of anger because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most lively memories of an early work, a office dominated by men, where I once began to cry in my angry inability to get caught by an older woman — a cool manager who I always feared — and took me to the staircase.
"Let them never see to cry," he said to me.
“ They don’t know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've been upset."
Patricia Schroeder, then representative of the Democratic Congress from Colorado, Gary Hart, worked on the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was captured with an extra-hunned Affe, the Monkey Business, and he fell out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, he figured out there was no reason why he couldn't start for the presidency himself.
“ There was no good thinking decision, ” he said to me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the competition, and the new candidate was requested in the middle of their backs.
Someone named him "The Snow White and the Seven Smurfs."
Since the campaign's been running for a long time, Ms. Schroeder has missed the money collection, so he promised he wouldn't compete unless he brought up $2 million.
He was a battle to die.
He realized that some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“ They thought I would receive a discount? ” he thought.
When he held a press conference that he did not launch an official campaign, the emotions were so distracted because of his appreciation for the people who support him and the frustration of the money collection and directly reaching the voters, and the anger of sexism, that his throat was pressed.
"They thought I had a nervous breakdown," said Ms Schroeder, how the press reacted.
“They thought that Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my tombstone?
"Crying"?
How can the US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening fire between the US and China was almost ear decaying, and even though the battle has not even ended near, the inter-country break-up is considered to benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, launched the first warnings at the beginning of the year by taxing the most important Chinese export products, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, as the new duties already affect a product worth $200 billion, which is virtually taxing half of the goods from China to the US.
In every case, Peking brought back a duty of between five and ten percent on an American product worth $60 billion.
China promised that it would take back every time, and the second largest economy in the world will certainly not retire in the near future.
If you'd like to get Washington to retreat, it would mean that you'd have to give up your back in front of the claims, but the public disobeying to the United States would be awkward for Hssi Chin-ping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing is tactics well, the US's commercial war pressure could benefit China in the long term as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision could be made in Washington or Beijing to create conditions that could push any of the economies of the two countries into the economy is much more serious than the observers have previously recognised,” said Abigail Grace, a research assistant in Asia at the New American Security.
Syria "is ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims that he is ready to return refugees on a voluntary basis and asks for help to rebuild a country that has been destroyed over seven years of war.
In his speech before the Grand Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem claimed that the state would improve.
"The current situation is more stable and safer, thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to reliability in the areas destroyed by terrorists and restore normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to escape between terrorism and self-authorised economic measures, which affected their daily lives and their livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
More six million people in the country need humanitarian help.
Moallem told me that the Syrian State welcomes all the help it has to rebuild this country.
But he stressed that no conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising would be accepted.
Europe acquired the Ryder cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup of 2018, defeating the U.S. team at 16,5:10,5 outside of Paris, Le Gold National.
The United States has now fallen six times on the European stage, and since 1993, they have not won Ryder cup in Europe.
Europe defended the title of championship because the Danish commander, Thomas Bjørn's team, reached 14,5 points needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player who was struggling the whole tour, dropped his punch in the water at par-3 16, giving Francesco Molinari the victory.
The Italian golf player Molinari shined among all, so he became one of the four players who have ever reached the 5-0-0 results since he started in the current form of gymnastics in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth received 5&4 from the lowest player in the European team, the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dutin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1 against the English Ian Poulter who might have participated in the last Ryder cup.
The eight Ryder-Cup veteran, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European winner of all times with the 25.5 career points.
“ I didn’t cry in Altala, but I couldn’t stop today.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for his choice and belief in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I got the cup back.
This is all about the team, and I am happy to be able to help," said Garcia, a European victory with emotions.
She's giving the staf to Jon Rahm, who won the American Golf League, Tiger Woods, in person on Sunday 2&1.
“I feel incredibly proud to defeat Tiger Woods, and I grew up with attention to this man, ” said the 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his fights in France, and now he's got a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistics from one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 titles, and only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who played great golf during the whole gym.
After the disappointing result of the United States team captain Jim Furyk’s team, he said: “She is proud of these boys because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we set Europe on fire.
We fought.
Get off the hat in front of Thomas.
Great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup our team, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to raise the hats, too.
The opponent was better than us."
