The Prague Stock Exchange has been minus at the end of the trading
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after the cramped fall in the morning.
Transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Company (ČEZ) are almost half of the normal daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued to fall on Monday from the start of the Tuesday trade when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street's shares is behind the fall.
We also have the market's reaction to the outcome of the vote in the US House, which has refused to support the financial sector's stabilisation plan there.
Determination of shares in Asia
On the Asian stock exchange, a dramatic fall in the stock fell on Tuesday, although some of the losses were finally deleted during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Exchange Index recorded almost four percent during the trading period, but later some of the losses were deleted and reduced to approximately 2,5 percent.
At the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell by 3.8 per cent, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
Sydney's stock shares lost more than 5 percent, but eventually the losses fell to 4.3%.
According to the Taiwanese index, the stock exchange fell by 3.6 per cent.
"The timing of the American rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," noted Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, defines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, the interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
Prime Minister Kevin Ruddd said that American legislatures should immediately renegotiate the negotiations and adopt the financial system's support proposal.
Otherwise, other countries are threatened to feel the consequences of this.
The American Shares Bathbad
On Monday, the US Assembly rejected the draft financial system support for which 700 billion dollars should have been spent (approximately 12 billion kroons).
Thus, the legislators ignored the call by President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush said that the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the economy as a whole.
On Monday, American shares survived a blood bath, and the leading stock indices recorded the biggest fall in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, with a similar level of fall last year in 1987.
The index has already fallen before the vote, but as it turns out that the proposal was not accepted in the House, the index began to be released.
Congress retired: US government can pump $700 billion to banks
The main leaders of the United States Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on the broader form of agreement and financial assistance for the US financial system.
They will vote for this at the beginning of next week.
In the negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan, American legislatures have undergone a breakthrough in the form of a financial assistance of USD 700 billion (approximately 12 billion) to the US financial system.
But there's still no victory.
The Congress must finish some of the details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and their votes.
The draft financial system support will be negotiated in the Assembly on Monday.
He informed the Reuters News Agency on Sunday, Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Organisation Committee.
According to Senate resources, they'll probably be able to vote on the draft early Wednesday.
According to the economists, it should be announced that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms thereafter, "rescue" will take place.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step.
We have solved various views on the form of a package to stabilise the market," he mentioned the Bloomberg Agency, Democratic Nancy Pelosi.
He believes that the final vote may take place on Sunday.
The representatives of the lawmakers met Henry Paulson, the U.S. Minister of Finance, on Saturday night to give the government a final form.
This should buy out unsaled mortgages from financial companies that lead financial firms to serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the whole system.
"We are now close to the final agreement on a draft that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue the repair plan, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets that fall strongly.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada says that the lawmakers are therefore trying to reach an end to the Congress on Sunday.
For this reason, they want to reassure investors before starting trade in Asian financial markets, where the decision of the Congress could first influence the monthly trade.
However, for now, it is not clear, when two chambers of the United States Congress vote on the law, as it is not, whether the negotiation can not end up at the last moment because of a problem.
The legislators hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is going through a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
According to President George Bush's request, the first $ 350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, the Congress could block the remaining amount, which was determined by additional $100 billion and later by $350 billion, if it feels that the programme does not perform its function.
Bush appreciated progress in the negotiations
Although the President may be able to take this decision, the Congress may review the veterinarian.
Despite these changes, however, the basic concept of the programme was the acquisition of financial assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that lose their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to cancel their mortgage credits.
"We've worked it all out.
The House of Constables should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Senator Judd Gregg Republican.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, the spokesman of Bush, said that the president is satisfied with the progress on Saturday and appreciates "the stabilisation of our financial markets and the protection of our economy made two-party efforts".
Restriction of bus terminals
Christopher Dodd, Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, leading the negotiations, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the closure of discounts and the timing of the financing draft.
The new law also restricts the performance of the so-called bus managers and establishes a fund supervisor committee.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made a great step towards an agreement that will work, which will be useful for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts with assistance to household owners who have problems with reimbursement.
In mortgages purchased by the government, the government should negotiate new deletion shares with a view to reducing the monthly deletion shares of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Social aid
The proposed draft is a good idea for David Marek, the leading economist of Patria Finance, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"It's because you can't know what mechanism and what price you're going to buy the troubled activity.
This will be decisive for the financial sector and the government to share the losses among themselves," he said this week to the iHNed.cz website Marek.
Marek thinks it's not so important that the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week.
"It is more important that the Congress will decide this week that the plan will be supported and will give their blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual importance of reaching agreement on the approval of the plan is the most important thing at this moment," stressed Marek.
Couple-fighting blades: MP3 players vs. mobiles.
Helping You Choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
This makes it clear that it's better just to buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons for a person to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on how to use it and the needs of the future owner.
It's probably hard to get a high-quality high-quality recorder to listen to that latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on bacheli plates, but there is no objective reason to do so from a quality point of view.
However, if the shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues bagel plates, you're probably dreaming of such a record player.
This is similar to that of travelling, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For some, it can be unacceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan probably hardly accepts a 20-month market earphone.
There are two extremes, which are enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The lifetime of the elements also counts
Some high-quality music players can do much more than simply playing music, but also what the majority of mobiles have not accidentally done.
None of these devices are as universal as the phone.
You can play music and videos in addition to the primary features of calling and texting, both of them, and you can even navigate a better-deteriorated camera.
And if we take into account smartphones and communications, he'll have a little computer in his pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can barbecue and no television can photograph.
There are also disadvantages for multiple-function mobiles.
The more features you use on your cell phone, the more times the display sends it to the charger.
And music plays are one of the biggest energy messengers.
A few mobile devices can play music for more than ten or ten hours, mostly less.
In this respect, music players (particularly the simplest) are significantly more effective.
That's why you're counting on cheap cell phones that they won't play for you a few hours.
If you even call here and there, get another charger at your workplace for safety - this applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will not have such a problem, even worse ones can handle continuous operation for at least 9 hours with one charge.
The next problem arises when the music is uploaded to the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers are wrestling without a adapter with miniature memory cards used in their mobiles.
With a few exceptions (iPod) for players, you do not need any special software.
Enough device to download from the computer with music through USB.
The majority of mobiles and players are already creating a musical library in order based on the user's evaluation, which is themselves the author, the name of the album, the genre, or, for example, the music library.
Some appliances only depict fascinations like Windows Explorer, and you know some of them (imiver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating systems).
Players can be handled easier, mobiles know more
When selecting the specific equipment, you should first and foremost be interested in the lifetime of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output, and, of course, the comfort of the treatment.
If music serves you primarily as a background and listens only for a short period of a day, for example, on the electric, any mobile playing MP3 will be suitable for you.
And that's what every mobile can do.
You don't have to pay attention to the musical formats your mobile or player knows.
The MP3 can handle each and the vast majority of the music you receive will be in this format.
MP3 is one of the most common and the vast majority of the devices are able to cope with the WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less likely to occur.
Righter mobiles also allow online music purchases.
Enough to visit the right pages of the service provider (or other provider) through the mobile internet and to buy the song or album.
This service can already be a solid argument for the purchase of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the supply of service providers is confined to vague and generally only one summer radio lounges.
Prices aren't even the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that music will dominate the music industry in the future (although through GSM, Internet or wireless internet).
Most people keep their mobile devices on their own.
At any time you want to listen to something, you scan your cell phone in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it depends even on whether or not he always wears earphones or at least the speakers.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker with which almost all mobiles, but only few MP3 players have.
For many, music mobiles will probably have the greatest advantage of the price.
The cheapest usually cost less than 3000 kroons.
There's enough fair walkman between three and four thousand crowns.
However, you are mostly limited by the absence of a traditional earphone.
The best and most technically equipped phones can cost up to 15 000 kroons with traditional 3,5 mm diameter earphones.
At the same time, the advantage of players is simple to handle.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest players (see our choice) can actually be handled.
The minimum function, the ability to manage before the usual cassette magnoo or gramphone is obvious.
There's no risk of collapse in the form of an accidental mobile internet, and there's no risk of data transmission in the case of a subsequent huge account.
What kind of device to choose
The cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have openings for changing memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
By buying the right card, you can access up to 20,000 crowns.
But be careful.
The basic types only support cards with maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive people can do what to do with up to 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and even want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB) there is no need to spend more than 1 100 kroons.
If you belong to more demanding students, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the comfort of the treatment is approaching the MP3 player.
In the sector, Sony Ericsson is the most fabulous, which has the same interface for Walkman's mobiles as separately sold MP3 players.
The MP3 players of the above brands can provide the same service in the same price category until 4000 kroons, but with larger memory capacity (approximately 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider is still going to Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The Czech mobile market is relatively advanced and our service providers offer practically the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, we are missing something here - a virtual service provider for classical service providers to make significant price reductions.
Maybe it won't be long.
On the Mobile.cz website, we have often written that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This has also been confirmed by the ČTÖ, which pointed out that the prices of texts in the Czech Republic are more expensive than other countries of the Union.
Following the last step of the European Commission to regulate roaming charges, there may be a controversial situation - some of the Czech mobile operators will be cheaper than domestics.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking true competition.
This may sound controversial, because we have three mobile networks and our penetration is over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are willing to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often in agreement with Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecoms Office, who stated a few times that there was no place for a new service provider in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic service provider with its own network is probably not able to have too much chances (all times it would probably be difficult to find frequencies).
But there is another option - the virtual service provider.
The entry into the mobile market of virtual service providers has just led to a significant price reduction, which the classic service providers had to react.
At the same time, even before the big fish are on the market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in Great Britain, sounds like ours.
However, it has proven that such providers have a place and can really succeed.
However, for example, we do not have to go too far.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the mobile virtual service provider in Poland.
This service provider has not been able to obtain more than 100 000 customers in a period of six months and becomes the fifth largest service provider there.
In the meantime, behind Mobilking, the Penta financial group is owned by U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much smaller target group.
For efficient operation, you need much less customers than a traditional service provider.
It is not due to relatively high costs for construction, mobile network operation and maintenance.
Virtual service providers in the world are thus usually present at low cost - they offer cheap calls and texts, which they often compensate for less services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers at least 50 percent cheaper texts than its competitors.
But as illustrated by the example of mobile in Poland, it can be a very good move to accept a target group.
This service is specifically focused on men.
"The real men choose the mobile service provider - who they like who they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company, who operates this virtual service provider.
It is hard to say if a vision like that in Poland can work with us.
Miroslav Čepický, the Speaker of Vodafone, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small to a segmentary approach based on the majority of virtual service providers.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory for the provision of services."
In the Czech Republic, it is impossible, claims by mobile providers
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be mobile.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem to have much hope.
Mobilking is more likely to be launched in other countries of our region," said Jana Stuničková, the spokesperson of the Penta Financial Group in his telephone interview to Mobil.cz..
In this context, it has demonstrated that existing mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not excessively related to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competition can be created.
The GTS Novera Group has been keeping its interest in the launch of the virtual service provider for a long time, thus trying to take another step in order to make Phoneica O2 a real competitor in the field of business customers.
"We are very interested in providing our customers not only wireless but also mobile telecom services.
The sooner the better.
This option has been discussed again with all Czech mobile providers.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the spokesman of the group.
Maybe there's better times now.
Informal information suggests that the first virtual service provider can be lucky by the end of the year.
However, his birth is surrounded by a wall of impenetrable silence.
"In this moment, we do not think that a full-value virtual service provider would be a place in the Czech market.
The Czech market is very special, unlike the other markets.
Until then, we have not been invited by an unanimous subject offering a complex and serious project in this area," he mentioned to Mobil.cz about the Vlastimil Sršeň, Telefonica 02 press department.
Other service providers also refer to the specific situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, the speaker of T-Mobile, in exceptional agreement with O2, adds: "We have not noted any viable and bilaterally advantageous business projects that could be further based on until now."
And he added: "In the T-Mobile network, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will appear by the end of the year.
At this point, there should be a specific agreement on our table, so that we can think in such a short term."
The Vodafone focuses on meeting its 3G licence requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are in the process of negotiating with potential virtual service providers, in particular in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider for customers to be the most affordable.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is a partner finding for the development of networks allocated to the fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - with service providers
The process of mobile service providers is easy to understand, entrusting a new service provider would lead to an increase in competition, a decrease in prices and a decrease in their profits.
So why should we make it easier to enter such a competition?
When the service providers have something important, they can cooperate, they also testify to the huzavone around the birth of U:fon.
The highest pressure on ČTUE was probably around the birth of the T-Mobile company U:fon.
This is witnessed on the website of the ČTUE for information available to the public.
But right now, the U:fon is a good reason why we shouldn't allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: "The environment of competition in the mobile market has recently been undermined by the entry of the fourth mobile service provider to the market.
In view of the nature of the Czech mobile market, it is obvious that the entry of a new player in the market and its services would create high requirements."
However, in view of such attitudes between mobile operators, the total interest of the Czech regulators is amazing.
At the same time, it is not only the ČTUU's attitude, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic, is not entitled to intervene in economic competition, apart from Great Britain and other developed countries.
Only the Economic Competition Office is entitled to this.
However, the Office is characterised by the whole problem.
"The entry of the virtual service provider to the mobile market would only be possible after the contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider was concluded on the hire of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties to traditional service providers is likely not sufficiently interesting," he mentioned our question of Kristian Chlapua, the External Relations Department of the Economic Competition Office.
Such a declaration from the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, the agency, which should represent the interests of consumers and also ensure that no one is able to return to its market situation, is more than strange.
In particular, if Kristian Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual service providers are normally operating, we can observe that their market entry has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile services."
However, pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and price reduction is probably not included in the interests of ÚOHS.
Indeed, the reaction of the three mobile service providers is a shocker.
The question is, is it really just a coincidence, almost by itself.
As in charge stations, the very same petrol prices must be just the works of coincidence and hard competition.
"The Office has not discovered any signs of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the providers have a leading position, i.e. not a more proportionate responsibility for market activity.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are likely to be missing for the telecom regulator," said Chalupa.
Presentation of the market leadership is one of the many points of debate.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTUE, based on telecoms from the perspective of economic competition.
There is, of course, no Czech service provider in a leading position in such a market.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - approval of the network operator is always necessary for the establishment of the virtual service provider.
And the mobile provider, relatively logically, has a monopoly on his own network.
So in a particular segment, it's necessary to be dominant.
But even if we did not accept this argument, it should be a minimum invaluation for the UPHS that three mobile operators are doing an outstanding similar approach.
In the meantime, complaints from interested parties (including GTS Novera mentioned) show that there are very similar barriers during negotiations with all service providers.
And the responsibility for the ČTÖ is a relatively usual trick in telecommunications, which the UPHS takes his hands off the whole case.
That's what we've met in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the recent text of the Telecommunication Act, the expansion of the competence of the ČTU has not been carried through the telecoms in the field of economic competition, although it has been hoped for a number of experts to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS need to know that well, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one's watching
In the meantime, the operation of some kind of unavoidable virtual service providers, which already operates in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies issuing their own mobile service price lists, which are only partially public.
Because it's multi-level marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile services.
Price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the company acting against the service provider as a classic company client that orders a large amount of SIM card.
You will then receive special offers (and other discounts) as an excellence customer.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar gains.
"If there were cases that were to be raised, it could be an infringement of the terms of the contract that we would deal with and which could lead to the completion of cooperation with that company," he answered our question about this problem, Martina Kemrová.
But it's pretty unlikely that the news about such activities would not have accessed the responsible staff of mobile operators.
In particular, it may be thousands of customers for the three companies mentioned.
In the meantime, no service provider is defending such a procedure.
Because they do not have negligible profits from the activities of these companies, and they do not in particular threaten to their own official marketing, in contrast to the actual virtual service providers.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however, only negligible percentages of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card is not on their name in their phone, so this cannot be fully provided as general customers of mobile providers."
But that's exactly what the ČTUE should do.
In addition, there is another question for the UOHS.
If mobile service providers are watching a similar procedure, why are they preventing the virtual service provider from being born?
It should be added that ÚOHS has relatively strong rights to expose such activities and, if you do not want, does not have to be satisfied by the service providers to explain that nothing like this was suspected and that commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, access to the mobile market for virtual service providers has resulted in a perceptible price reduction of services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers were established, the classic service providers tried to prevent their emergence more or less.
The arguments they use were practically the same - too small, possibly too satisfied markets, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in the developed countries, in these moments, regulatory bodies have intervened, which in no way protect the interests of mobile providers, but of their customers.
Then, either by formal measures or by informal pressure, it was achieved that the first virtual service provider was created, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are giving the whole case to each other.
On the basis of our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unevident competences are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If background information is good and the virtual service provider will really appear soon, the Czech mobile market may re-enter.
If any service provider would allow the establishment of any virtual mobile service provider, ÚOHS may be difficult to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of additional interested parties.
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not call more expensive.
The new Czech hymnus has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four processings of the new version of the Czech state hymnus.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek feasted on the day of the Czech State, where is my country?
The hymnus was recorded in the National Theatre's band under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlavs.
There are four versions available - male or female solo, singer or instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are singing.
The authors of the amendment of the hymnus are Otkar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can hear all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
Bělohlavs consider the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio had already told him that he was selecting young singers who were deliberately representative for singing solo variations, which are express and popular.
"I tried to take care of the pure division, the clarity and consistency of the text from the beginning of both of them and later at the band," he said.
The Czech State Hymnus celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Where is my country?" was first silenced in 1834 by Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka in addition to the music of Franzichek Škrop.
It became popular, and people considered it spontaneously to be their own.
And the first verse of the song has become a natural part of the state hymn after the formation of Czech Slovakia in 1918.
After the formation of the independent Czech Republic, one of the seven state symbols remained.
How's the "new" hymnus?
The Prague transport company first delivers chip cards on Wednesday
On Wednesday 1 October 2008, the first passenger who has an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper line in the history of the Prague Transport Company when he enters metro, trams and buses.
The coupon is currently available for about 10,000 who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase 30-day and 90-day coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) while at the information centres of the transport company and their services at the Metro stations Muzeum, Mřstek, Nadraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can be purchased from yesterday on the Internet via the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until afternoon hours.
Those who start using online trade can permanently forget the publishing windows of metro stations where they had to go through long lines so far.
The coupon can be purchased via the Internet, and the Opencard card will be accessed in one of the thirteen accounts of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have access to a bar with trained servers who help interested people to purchase and access their purchased coupon on the internet," said Martin Opatrný, speaker of the project.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can be saved for Opencard in some self-service automatics equipped in front of the halls.
How do these automatics look?
The Reds, the ticket managers, and the passengers may have noticed them at the Metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavska.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but it should be eighty by the end of the year," he added Opatrný.
The coupon is checked by automatic instead of the driver
Their operation is easy to handle the automatics starting tomorrow.
It's enough to place the Opencard chip card and the coupon paid earlier will be saved from itself.
The electronic coupons will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
So on trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, mainly those travelling to the capital of Central and Czech Republic.
"On trains classified in integrated transport in Prague, fishermen were carried out with card readers to establish the validity of the coupons in the zone," explained Philip Drapal’s inspection of the lines from the Ropid organization comprising the Prág public transport schedule.
In buses around the city, the card readers are integrated in the driver's wallet.
The driver should therefore not only show the chip card when he enters, but also the Opencard should be placed in a position on the side of the cash register.
That's how the driver checks the coupons.
"If, for example, the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the easiest thing is to ask the driver to do this," he added Dráp.
Passengers who do not travel with buses around the city and will not remember when their coupon is due again can go to the self-service automatics that save the coupons for cards.
Information on the validity of their documents shall be displayed here on the display of the device.
The Sudanes wanted a referendum from the United States.
The Sudanese Germans were asked to join the United States of Šumava in 1945.
This is found in the letter that is in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Czech Republic.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the United States patronate.
It is said that in 1945, some groups of the Sudanese Germans turned to the President of the United States with this wish.
This is also seen from a private archive that is held in the collection of the South Chechnical Library today.
In a letter from Česky, the Germans ask the American President not to allow the re-leasing of the 'Chumava County' to Czech Republic, which was still held by Hitler under the Treaty of Munich.
"The situation has been interpreted correctly and we really want to be sure of the words that the American troops are in no way coming to German territories as an oppressor and enemy, but as a liberator," in the letter, "Mens who carry the fate of Šumava on their hearts" is signed in the letter.
Since the addition to Czechoslovakia to the Sudanese Germans, with the knowledge of the Czech national character, is supposed to give hope for brutality, mercy, not understanding, repression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take the protectorate over Shumava "for all eternity".
"We can't believe that, regardless of the opinions of four million inhabitants, this area would be judged to us as a foreign country, which is depressing and depressing the minority, and almost nothing would contribute to the victory of allies," says the letter.
The reason the authors couldn't sign was supposed to be the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Tsjechic Repressors".
So if the President of the United States allegedly doubted the opinions of the Shumavai Germans, it would be enough to hold a referenda in the county of Shumava to see if its inhabitants wish to become part of the United States and live under the patronisation of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive, along with the current knowledge of postwar history, some historians depict the current expectations of the Sudanese Germans properly.
Even if the Czech Germans had to minimise their relocation from the country, only a few of them recognised the possibility of this.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudanes.
Again, others trusted that they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in České Budějovice.
Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German in Budějovice during the war.
At the end of the war, when the British captured him and put him into the holštynsko prison camp, dozens of other Czech Germans went to teach them to Czech.
"They trusted that if they came home, they could use the Czech language," Chalupa said.
Before the war, none of the German prisoners in Czechoslovakia thought that they would be displaced from the country on the basis of the Beneš Decree.
You're not thinking, you're paying!
Emotional campaign attacks leaders
The most expensive action in the Czech history for the safety of roads.
It would also be characterised by the media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Šebiček's office from this campaign hopes that he will scare the leaders from the dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The 150 million campaign will be included on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on flyers.
You should warn the drivers from speeding up and alcohol.
And you should remind them that their seat belts will be knocked in before they leave.
First of all, young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians, and not least professional leaders want to speak to their conscience.
And what happens in the commercials?
Emotional, mostly human stories.
That's what the whole "bloody" slogan of the campaign also proves:
You're not thinking, you're paying!
The term "no thinking" on the plate is in big letters.
And the word "payer" is in the lake of blood.
This must symbolize that man can pay for a moment of distraction.
The viewers are "frightened" by the ads until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the English Saxon countries, where the dramatic images of the victims of accidents can be seen regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The promotional support was prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Pull it, put it on the drivers
"To the drivers, the system is valid.
For them, for example, when they go through the red, they save time.
"Take it" is the risk of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, especially for the negative campaign, the psychologist thinks.
He thinks that the driver's attention is less effective on the sign of danger.
"If the warning board is equipped, it is likely that the environment will soon melt and the leaders will not deal with it," warned Kořán.
Olmer would give back almost all the landowed areas in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmer, Chairman of the temporary Israeli government, spoke of the practical return of all areas in 1967, namely the western coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan-fennish, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview that was published on Monday by Jediot Achron on a daily basis.
"We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means that almost all if we don't have to give back all the areas (offshore)," he told Olmer to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we need to transfer a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without that there will be no peace," he added.
He acknowledged that the possible return includes my East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and in particular wants tractors and bulldozers not to go through their legs as one of my best friends had to give up some of Jerusalem," he noted Olmer, referring to the attack on two cities in July, during which some people were killed and a few dozens of them were injured.
The Prime Minister thinks it will be necessary to find a special solution for the Temple Mountain, the Holy and Historical Places in Old City.
"The one who wants to preserve Israel's sovereignty over the city must integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he emphasised.
Out of the Golan-flake
He also expressed an clarified opinion on the withdrawal of the Israelites from the Golan Peninsula, which he believes is an essential condition for the peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require a certain effort from Damaskus.
"I do not recommend peace with Syria only on the basis of the way out of Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians are well aware of what they have to resign to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollahhal (Siit movement); they must provide regular support to Hamas (Siit movement), the terrorists of Al-Qaida and Jihad (Sent War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister clarified.
Questions After an accident: Are passengers in buses illegal?
The law doesn't know them. You can't walk in a remote bus.
Regarding the tragic bus accident of Student Agency, the question was whether passengers and passengers could travel in the bus along the way near Padova, Italy.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally, the passenger's activities are inconsistent with the law on transport activities," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the driver of a truck crossing the road of the bus is likely to be the result of the death of a 20 - year - old passenger.
At that moment, she was sitting next to the driver, at the least safe place in the bus, even though she had two other seats.
The bus may be impacted or suddenly stopped at the moment the traveller serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
She has the ability to see if the bus has a seat under the registration permit.
If the bus is not homologised, passengers must sit.
The distant buses of the Student Agency have no seats; this is confirmed by Radim Jančura, director of the company.
"We tried to find a solution with this Ministry, and the passengers were not allowed at first.
However, this was withdrawn and we found that passengers could go to a room during the journey if they had their own meeting," he said.
The law doesn't know the traveller
"There is no clear legal alignment on the role of a passenger - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the provision of services to the carrier.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a vehicle driver; its rights and obligations are not defined by Hanzelka’s Speaker.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, the Director of the Ministry of Transport Road Vehicle Operation, considers that the law properly handles the problem.
"Depends on whether the bus has a seat in its license.
And it's over," tell me.
Buses may, according to their discrimination, be urban with seats and limited to maximum speed, with stations and permissible higher speed, with no stations and maximum speed, with seats with seats with safety belts.
Like on the plane, the expert says.
Jaroslav Hořín, transport security expert in BESP, sees no basic problem on the bus.
"In the course of continuous progress, there is no danger, we can compare the situation with the services on aeroplane.
I'm not sure when there's a turbulence and the airman can beat his head."
"But if the bus suddenly stops, of course, his physical laws are valid.
Same as in city buses or tramways.
The safety of passengers must be resolved by internal rules," he says and also believes that the problem has not been resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to remove services
Student Agency offers traveller services as the only bus carrier.
He's in charge of 200 passengers.
After the accident, the Director doesn't think their professions are risky.
"But as soon as I have the impression that it is risky for passengers, I will stop it.
The coffee and newspapers are available for passengers when they get in.
That would also be cost savings," you say.
In his vehicles, the lack of passengers' attendants was justified by the security interests of Alexej Litvin, Director of Asian, who operates a fragment of flights compared to Student Agency.
"We have no passengers, we are opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it ends with some kind of lethal injuries," he said to Týden.cz just a year ago.
It's an incredible tragedy.
A young passenger attendant in plzeň, who worked for the company two years ago, died on a scheduled flight in Naples.
The Slovenian truck was probably pulling out of the stop bar without using a direction indicator and stopping the bus.
The bus driver suddenly tried to get out with maneuver, but the right front part of the bus hit him.
The fact that two reserved seats for the rest of the passengers were sold is that of Jančura.
"You can't book these spaces on long distance flights, you can't block them."
The company wants to sue the truck leader.
By compensating the daughter's family, the agency is not waiting for the court's judgment, but also expects financial compensation from the offender.
Change of law?
In the Far future
Strengthening the movement of passengers on board the bus would mean the amendment of the law, where the 30 experts of the Ministry of Transport have been working for more than a year.
"But the group did not achieve any concrete results.
The buses are not too much, rather the point system deals with maximum speed on the highway and mobile use during driving," says Hořín expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of passengers to be a fundamental threat to the safety of passengers," said Hanzelka’s spokesman, having the responsibility of the police and the occupational authorities to control the safety of buses.
Düsseldorf's hopes go to Frankfurt
The letter written to the members of the bank of the WestLB Management Board does not narrow down in large words.
From the merger of the departments of the Düsseldorf financial institution and of the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt, the "Central Capital Market Organisation of the Treasury Financial Group" could be created, writes the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would take a long-term profitable "competence block" into such a business.
Such a connection could give the final push to further mergers in the province banking sector.
This is a reading of a board of directors trying to prove their capacity to act in difficult times.
For the uncertain WestLB bank continues to face enormous pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Supervision, which has recently informed the North-Raja-Westfalian Government that the time limit for finding a sustainable solution is limited.
However, for savings cash customers, the famous Deka-Bank and WestLB investment funds have been a subject of a kind of relationship - a part of Frankfurt.
Franz Waas, head of Deka-Bank, already at the end of August, when declaring half-year data, informed that the Bank in Mainzer Landstraße and a province bank such as Helaba or WestLB's merger do not understand.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of Deka, representing one half of the province banks and the other half of the representatives of the Treasury Associations, instructed the Management Board to continue negotiations with WestLB on joint business activities.
In this context, the capital market business or certain parts of it may be discussed.
However, the negotiations - set out by financial circles - have just started.
The name Deka-Bank, one of the major employers in the Frankfurt financial sector, does not appear first in relation to the consolidation of the Spare Treasury sector.
In 2003, Deka-Bank appeared to be united with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, this three covenant became nothing.
The plans have barely been published, the Government of the province of Helaba spoke against the interest of Helaba.
After that, the other two banks did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead went to Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of the relationship between Deka-Bank and the province banks has re-established.
Last time, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of Helaba, spoke against the plans of the mergers with his bank.
Notwithstanding this, it is recognised that there is a need to approach the various banks in the different sectors.
The relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is now expected at the first time after the province meetings in Bavaria.
For Helaba, that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure on further mergers is increased, potential partners may slowly lose their weight.
In southern Germany, only a younger business partner could be, while the financial crisis has so far been substantially better than the banks in Muntchen and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was excluded at the beginning of the year by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, with an 85% business rate in Hela.
The NordLB won't be.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the vessel.
On the other side, the question is how different business models of each bank fit together.
Merl stated in June that the German Depositary and Jury Association had not answered the crucial question of the business model to ensure the future of the province banks.
Finally, it is possible to cut the WestLB, which they obviously do not want there.
Thus, the letter of the Board of Directors there also states that they are definitely seeking a "full solution".
How this is compatible with the merger of individual units with Deka-Bank, it is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the late weekend"
This is Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth time.
But now Elena's here as her girlfriend, and so everything's different, says Luca.
Behind them, there is a strong body-catched man with a five-liter barrel of the Kaiser brand, and he proves to 200 people traveling to October, what deep noises he can get out of his throat.
Elena first found Luca's face, and then she kisses her.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, four buses depart at 23.45 a.m., next to the Puorta Nuova Station, with a destination, are expected to arrive at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are mainly held for Italians, in the fourth, only Brazilians travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans were already singing alongside their flag, and they started celebrating the night.
And so loudly, it's not for Italians," says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long, artificial fur coat and a wide, silver-wing glasses.
He traveled to Oktoberfest five years ago, only three trips this year.
At night, during the day at October, at 10:30.
The accommodation would only mean unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The road costs 75 euros, including a German language course in Marco Frankfurt, which has been cooked by the Bajoran Bier Cleanliness Act.
And now the buses are going to get into the night on the highway towards Brennero.
No beer, not yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, the passengers will sleep.
All right, well, they're gonna need their strength.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, several Italian buses on highway 8 even take a short break before Munich.
When Marco’s group arrives in the parking lot near Theresienwiese, as planned at half seven, there are nearly 50 other buses coming from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is holding one last report, presenting the military plan.
First, everybody wear the yellow hat.
On its left side, the title "Octoberfest" written by the fracture is read, alongside Marco's travel office's internet address: "conossicersviagiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors of the beer opens, runs," Marco calls it in the morning.
"Futus!" Running and reservoirs in the back of the tent.
"Not in advance, because we're stuck, and not on the same benches, every yellow hat should be scattered in the tent."
The one-liter corroborate costs 8,25 euros, screams by Marco.
And not to forget about the tips.
"Just show the security guards that they're doing well.
As you leave your seats, they'll take them."
Thirdly, "Tonight at 11:30 p.m., be back here!" Understood?
And now we're heading to Wiesn.
On the way, one man is bound by yellow hats to trees, boards, and even to the electoral poster of one of the great Bajoran peoples.
We need to prepare for retreat.
This is the second weekend of Octoberfest, known as "the late weekend".
There are no accurate figures; they talk about 50.000 people who cross the Alpoways in the beer cranes; ten percent of all visitors of the weekend are supposed to arrive from Italy.
The Mönchen Police Police are reinforced by seven South-Tiroli police, Italian volunteers help the Bajor Red Cross, where in their national statistics the Italians are booking the first place before the Austrians (approximately 80) and the low-level British (approximately 60).
The Hofbrou beer is particularly popular among Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed by Peer Steinbrück Federal Finance Minister only last week.
Fortunately, the politician used the word "proportionately" and inclined it to say that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because this was the weekend.
Daxon has received a billion loans from the German bank consortium to defend itself against market turbulences.
A person with the situation informed Reuters on Monday that the loan subsidies would be paid to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate should only pay interest after the part that was used.
The money is partly from private and partly public banks.
In the background, the losses of the Depfa subsidiary are.
According to a newspaper newsletter, Depfa lent money for long-term projects and refinanced himself to them for a very short period of time, which is now not possible due to the lack of confidence on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve decreased by 95% to EUR 2.37 million and the share of its own capital fell slightly from 1.6 to 1.45%.
Current revenues and net revenues from cash trades have returned to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, revenues from credit claims and fixed securities and the liquidation of credit business reserves fell to more than EUR 70 per cent by a decrease of EUR 5 million.
It was only due to the higher revenues resulting from the reimbursement of the ex-post accounting costs of the reconstruction of the former Depfa group and to the reimbursement of interest under the tax order and the relatively moderate income deficit for the companies under the scheme.
After privatisation in 1990, the former state financer speculated with corporate real estate loans, which were subsequently separated in Aeral Bank.
Since classic public funding could be used for a few, Depfa increased its involvement in infrastructure projects and joint projects of private investors and the State (private-public partnership, PPP) and extended its activities internationally.
The value of the subsidiaries is now to be described by Hypo Real Estate, which has a "significant effect" to show the group's results – it has been generally reported.
It's a fact that the dividend was not paid.
The dividend was reduced to a third by 2007.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has become a significant state and infrastructure fundor.
In comparison to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on cross-bank refinancing as it does not have customer deposits.
By the collapse of the US Lehman Brothers Investment Bank two weeks ago, the bank's lending between the two banks was negligible as banks maintain their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term instruments to refine some of the Depfa credit portfolio - about EUR 50 billion - annually.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the group's funding requirement is covered by the loan for time, and the company is protected from "the influence of international financial markets that are currently highly incapable of operation."
According to other sources, the funds provide refinancing by the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, President of the HRE Executive Board, stated, however, that the Hypo Real Estate group would not have to use the financial markets for an in-depth period.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) see that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now guaranteed.
This gives the shareholders and creditors of the bank hope.
But because of the dynamism and inefficientness of the crisis, they can't be sure.
It is not even possible that funding should not be fully utilised.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the Saturday night news said that the bank was still on the edge of bankruptcy, the temporary rescue of the bank could not relax the tendency.
The share price fell to EUR 3.30 by a 75 per cent reduction.
On the other hand, bond prices are quite well held.
While the first-position debts are barely changing, the exchanges of back-to-back bonds have significantly declined.
In particular, the crisis affects the past subsidiary, Württemberg Hypo’s bonds and, as far as practicable, the periods beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds seemed to be a speculative alternative to investment, their value must now be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system as a result of the emergence of the bank crisis and the fact that the financial institution has taken the crisis to almost house by taking Depfa.
As long as note banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, the reimbursement of the benefits can be made for the deadline.
Or there will be a situation where no one currently hopes that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in the light of the partial publicisation reports, the probability limited to certainty has now become a purely legitimate hope.
For long-term creditors, the decision to waive their investment can be unconscious nights.
However, short-term investors may use the sale to reserve taxes to be paid after the price gains of the coming years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the tin box
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce himself in the Tachibana High School on the first day of his teaching, the girls start swinging: The German girl is totally "big"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word about mangoes - she's talking about Japan in the new exchange school blog.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I'm so excited.
I was already on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, towards Kaviaki, and I travel for 40 minutes with a train to the Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't miss it.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibane is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students start to scream at eight hours until at 8:40 a short conversation with the teacher, "home room".
But before teaching began, I had the order to introduce myself.
I'm not the type of person who's willing to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, I've picked up an old skirt, a blouse, a blue knees and a black leather shoes.
So in this dress, I stood in front of your categor, and I tried to tell you everything right, "Sajonara, Vo se Sylvana..." - They call me Sylvana, I came from Germany, and I'll be my birthday in a week.
At this moment, I was very happy that I've started learning the language for two years.
All 31 girls were whispering, whispering and whispering, and I always heard the word "scrape."
I knew that from my mangaes.
It belongs to the Japanese girls' basic words, and it means "sweet, sweet."
Then I rushed to my place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled widely and felt honored to be placed next to the exchange students.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the bell sounded, they were regularly running.
Everyone spoke and laughed, and they drilled a hole in my abdomen with their questions, and it was quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
After the break, everyone packed out their bentos.
My guest viewer made me a lunch like this - this is completely different from the boring German ten-hour sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, little sausages, salads, fruit, and some tofu sprout meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
The foods look strange, and they taste completely new.
It's actually all very delicious.
Yeah, well, except for the salt spoon, brrrrr.
In Japanese schools, Bento is not just lunch.
A girl may give a boy a handmade bento, which is especially made up by artists - in the hope of getting to know the boy in the lunch break.
That's what I read in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can observe this here.
"Why is Japan?", my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because you're just charming me."
After all, I've been reading the manga for years.
And to understand the comics and the culture described in them, I started to learn Japanese sometime.
It was quite clear to me that I would have to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and habits.
And these are very high-valued here.
Japan, on the one hand, is a country of latest techniques and trends - and on the other, strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything so well-organized, I never felt lost, even if Tokyo was the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
The rats have feelings too.
A rat or a moly escapes, does that mean he's afraid?
Joseph LeDoux is a neurologian who is convinced that animals have feelings.
But how can we examine if they feel the same way when they behave like us?
In the "Edge" Internet magazine, famous scientists have published their articles for years.
In one of his series, SPIEGEL ONLINE looks at the answers to the question, "What does it think is real without proof?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other mental conditions without me or anyone else being able to prove that so far, it is true that we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as we look at other species, and as far as sensitivity or general knowledge issues are concerned, we arrive in a difficult field, as hardware is not matched.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: pretending to be dead, running, or attacking.
People behave in a similar way, resulting in comparative subjective experience from some researchers.
I do not believe in that, however.
The two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to carry our own subjective experiences through the animals.
On the one hand, human conscious circuits almost always include side prefrontal cortex (as a result of the role played in short-term memory and implementation/management functions).
This broad area is more advanced for humans than for other main mammals and appears to be completely missing for other living creatures.
At least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as the awareness of who we are, or, in the case of design and decision-making ability, it is reasonably assumed that the person is different from the other main mammals.
A further dramatic specificity lies in the human language nature: As a large part of human experience is related to the language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In that case, animals may be excluded.
However, even if the language is not dependent on the language, the language would certainly be influenced, so the animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is likely to differ strongly from the majority of our consciousness conditions.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may be for other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and because of our own experience, the special hardware cannot be analysed, his research puts us at serious problems.
Most of my ideas relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be accessible to science.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without prejudice to content, and this is exactly what is happening in the case of experiments on the short-term memory of major mammals, especially in the example of visualisation.
However, in this presumption, Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely on the neural contexts of consciousness rather than on the courier mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this assumption also highlights the importance of prefrontal cortex in the formation of visualisation.
What is the result of this?
I'm reassuring that an emotional system, as well as fear, will be activated in a brain that knows what it is doing.
What we call fear is the mental condition in which we are when the activity of the localised defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) involves working memory.
Thus, emotions are closely linked to the areas of the brain cortex that are characteristic of the main mammals and especially of the human.
In addition to the linguistic nature, sensitivity is divided into delicate degrees, because with words and linguistics, we are able to distinguish and categorize conditions, so that we can write them to others, alongside us.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that emotions are derived from simpler activities in the area of body sensitivity of the cerebral and the cerebral stem, as well as Jaak Pankeep, who concentrates more on the cerebral stem.
Since this network has not changed very much during human evolution, it can easily play a role in the emotion of species.
Theoretically, I can't defy that, but I think it's unsecurable.
Panxeep believes that what appears to be fearful in rats and humans is likely to feel in both cases: How can rats and people be monitored to feel the same way when they behave similarly?
A cow escapes in danger, does he feel fear too?
In my opinion, just similar behavior is not evidence of the same experience.
Even though neural confusion helps further: rats and people have a similar brain burst, but coyotes don't have a brain.
But is the brain skull responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proven for humans, how can we prove that to rats?
I think rats and other mammals have feelings, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?).
But I don't know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are suspected to differ fundamentally from ours, based on special circuits of human consciousness and the language, I look for the emotional behaviour of rats rather than emotional emotions.
However, progress in this area is progressing at the neural level, if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Like I don't look for the tongue and consciousness in the case of rats, I don't know if they exist.
This may seem like a short-looking attitude, but I'd rather go forward than keep fighting a wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: Time of mercy for Poland and Ukraine
Ivan Vasjunik, Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, announced that the preparations will soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the trust in Ukraine in the UEFA Bordeaux decision and the proof that they believe that Ukraine is capable of organising the European Championship together with Poland," said Vasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work just started, and there's a lot to do in both countries."
As regards the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are missing.
It is possible to reduce the number of EB stadiums from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
"We have to work with silence right now," said Grigori Surkis, President of the Ukrain Football Alliance.
"The UEFA will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, they were designed to take even more radical steps.
After several scandals, the National Olympic Commission suspended the Polish PZPN Association, replaced by the independent Inspector Robert Zawlock.
The Commission held a meeting on the initiative of the Minister for Sports of Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"The major threat that PZPN is unable to work according to the rules," said Drzewiecki to the Polish PAP intelligence.
"We have provided Michel Platini, President of the UEFA, that this will not adversely affect the preparations of the 2012 EB."
Only in the past, a number of first teams had to be classified in the lower class because of manipulation, and eventually the leakage station had to be postponed.
The mad Dennis Quaid's going back.
The actress wanted to promote a new film, talk about her personal life in the interview, and now she's hurting her ex-husband, and Ryan's star in Hollywood considered her former husband Dennis Quaidet.
The one who bows down - and cuts back
The war of late roses at the Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex married couple: The two Hollywood actors have fought ugly fights with each other seven years after their divorce.
And in an interview with the American InStyle magazine last week, Ryan said about the reasons for his divorce, "Dennis was loyal to me for a long time, which caused many pains."
And only after the divorce, he found out how many women Dennis cheated on him.
There was a press work on Ryan's new "Women" film on the psychic strip, which tells the story of adultery.
Dennis Quaid strongly responded to his crying out as an unfaithful husband: "A terrible" - said the 54-year-old actor to the New York Daily News newspaper, "that Meg reproduces and spends the story of our relationship."
In addition, it's "serious" that 16-year-old boys, Jack, are repeatedly reminded of all the pain and change that divorce causes a child.
While Ryan's been alone since his divorce, Quaid got married again and recently became the father of a twin couple.
Therefore, his answer concludes with the following side cut: "My life will continue anyway.

Flights and hotel rooms are downwards
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodations were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany have become less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of flights and hotel rooms have become more favourable - so a study of American Express travel and financial service providers can be summarised.
The company analysed the first half of 2008 booking data and established a significant price drop in the second quarter following the first quarter price increase.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, the accommodations have become much cheaper in many places.
During January to March, prices increased by an average of 6.9% in 41 of the 48 cities in Europe compared to 2007.
However, during the period from April to June, prices were already below 3.6 per cent than in the previous year.
This trend was seen in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than one year earlier.
That's why American Express sees the low price of the dollar, which led to the "going travel of American tourists".
The decrease in hotel room prices is more affected by financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than industrial cities such as Hannovert, Kölnt or Stavanger.
A 26.3% increase in hotel prices in the Norwegian city is a European record.
In the first quarter, there was an increasing trend in the prices of airlines.
Due to the kerosin increase, passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more in the tourist class than in 2007, while long-term flights with high fuel demand increased by 29.2 per cent.
During April to June, the price of tourist tickets decreased by an average of 12,5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first class, prices showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Prices increased by 11.9 per cent between January and March and decreased by 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
According to the study, domestic flights in Germany decreased by half.
The reason for price decreasing lies on the one hand in moderate economic growth, says the company.
The demand has weakened in many segments of the airport market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement which liberalises flights between the US and Europe will increase the pressure on competition.
The stressed situation proves that airlines cancel their lost flights, and several airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe this concerns 24 airlines.
HSV is bleeding at 1:0 on Gladbach
A gollal and simple methods have been made to the top of the table of Hamburger SV.
Borussia's Luhukay is still failing to find a working team.
Kristoffer Klein Enlarge Deep Flight for the National Selected Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player just got into the game late, and his lift came back from the gate.
His exact message left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We have a need for the second goal" sparked Hermann Rieger in the hallway leading to the Hamburg Arena Cabines.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break ended, and most of them sat back on their seats.
Rieger was the HSV's physicotherapeut for almost three decades, and he enjoys more authority than some of the bully players.
So your request found an interview at the competent place.
Counselor Cornelius Jol sniffed and showed his thumb unanimously.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach Martin Jol in Hamburg.
His command could have spoken similarly: Here is the second goal!
Execution of command has failed.
"It wasn't always beautiful today," said Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt's "respectively imagined it" as well.
The results of 1: 0 (1:0) are due to the head of the Hamburgians Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that the very weak Gladbachs could not cause pain to the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a filthy victory," said Martin Jol.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 on Monday.
The viewers were celebrating themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the table appearing on the screen, which appeared as the first of the championship.
It's gonna be a partyless birthday.
"We know where to put it," said Marcell Jansen.
It seems that the intermediate certificate of the table does not indicate the precautionary nature of the league rather than the dominance of the HSV.
Although the team finds itself slowly, thanks to its lately committed earnings - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the gate of Petric and Jansen from FC Bayern - but it's not barbecue yet.
"We need more sense and action," demanded Jol.
After the deportation
The Wall Street is intimidated by fear.
With the first news of the failure of the rescue package, Dow Jones temporarily dropped 700 points.
That was the greatest loss of points in his history within one day.
Later, the Dow got somewhat stronger.
At 20:30, the most important stock exchange barometer in the world was 5 percent negative and stood at 10.579 points.

None of the papers got stronger.
The shares of the Goldman Sachs bank fell by almost 10 percent.
Only a few days earlier, he bought a bank participation in Warren Buffett, a large investor.
In the context of the rescue operation, resources are intended to be made available for the purchase of so-called "third mortgage papers".
However, the amount is to be paid gradually, not at the same time.
In exchange, the State would receive the stock options for financial institutions, which could be settled in the event of a proper exchange of exchanges, reducing the burden on the public kabinet.
European and American and share exchanges
The billion-dollar aid granted to European and American banks does not disperse investors' doubts.
The stock price of the German Great Bank is falling and grabs Dax with you.
The American Dow Jones indicator is decreasing despite the state's planned saving of the money market.

The value of the real estate fundor's shares in München fell to its quarter, despite the rescue operations of the federal government and private banks, with more than 20% weakened the Commerzbank.
Dax has fallen below the important 6000 points of psychology and recorded 5839 points with a 3.7 percent minus.
The stock markets have been forced to kneel around the world.
In New York, Wall Street opened a major loss.
Investors are afraid that the $700 billion rescue package of the US government will not be enough to boost the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, i.e. 3,3 percent fell to 10.809,25 points.
The American Parliament will vote on the rescue plan, the Senate vote may take place on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges have only one direction known: in London, the FTSE indicator showed a 3.2 per cent weakening, the CAC 40 lost 2.9 per cent in Paris.

Dark material affects the flight of space pianos
A mysterious phenomenon has caused controversy among researchers for years. Dark material affects the speed of space pianos during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity cannot be fully correct.
The Ulysses Space Zone flew in space for almost 18 years.
The fast-frozen fuel pipes are threatening the freezing.
A mysterious phenomenon, swing-by anomaly, has been causing confusion among scientists for years.
Swing-by is the gravitational price control of space sodas, where they make an additional boost in a sky body, such as the Earth's gravitational space.
So the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Casini-Huygens research session used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar.
However, researchers have been impressed for years: Flight objects do not behave fully as they would have been expected under the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, there are abnormalities in the speed.
Sondes are suddenly speeding up or slowing down.
Physicians have never found an explanation for this effect until now.
The phenomenon was baptized as a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely valid, which will see the mass attraction of the material as the curve of the space.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist, the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to believe that Einstein was not mistaken and that the swing-by anomaly is trying to explain with the so-called dark material that astronauts discovered in the universe.
"The anomaly of the dark material may be responsible, which may be found even near the Earth," says Adler.
The existence of the dark material was known only ten years ago by space researchers.
It is evident that gravitational force is formed which can be observed for the effects on other sky bodies.
However, the material itself does not release or revert visible electromagnetic radiation, which is completely invisible, i.e. nothing, especially visible light.
Scientists estimate that a good one of the entire mass of the universe is made up of dark material.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are released
After spending ten days in captivity of their abductors, the Egyptian foreign minister confirmed it again.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a million-dollar ransom.
In the shooting prior to the release of the hostages, six hostages were supposed to die.
Five German citizens were kidnapped in South Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are ongoing.
Again and again Germans become targets for kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports the most important cases.
European tourists transported in the Sahara are free.
This was commonly reported by the Egyptian public television, Al-Arabian TV tax and Italian media.
According to the Italian Sky TG 24 television broadcasters, the Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: "Our fellows and other hostages have been released.
"We are currently examining their health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians, and a Romanian and eight Egyptian escorts are safe and safe - reported by the Egyptian public television.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are supposed to be on their way to Cairo.
The reason for the shooting before the hostages were released continues to be vague: According to an Egyptian security officer, the hostages have already shown their willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army surprisingly killed their effects.
"The problem is solved.
"The ransom was accepted," said the official.
"It was only about taking the hostages into the trial," when suddenly the surprise happened.
Sudanese soldiers were shot on Sunday in the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt by six kidnappers, and two were arrested.
The hostages demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The Al-Masri al-Jom newspaper, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release of hostages is delayed because the kidnappers are concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, hostages release female hostages after the ransom payment.
Men are held by kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Kairo refused to take a position on this report.
"Including suicide" is Stiefpa's violence.
In court, he said that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather was violent with her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, spent six years in the Cornwall county Stithians, in prison after confession of attempted eight-range rape sexual assault.
The Throro Criminal Court acknowledged that she regularly tied her stepmother Stephanie Randle between her five- and seven-year-olds.
In one of Trerise's confessions, she said, "I feel like I'm responsible for her death."
At the trial, Randle was murdered at the age of 34 in the home of the town of Plymouth in the quarter of Mutley on April 1, 2007.
When he was a kid in Coventry, Trerise tied him up and tied his eyes in front of cooperatives while his mother worked in a beer shop.
Trerise is divorced from her wife in the 1980s, and she chose Cornwall again.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turns out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust's monumental protection organization, was persecuted by the fears of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, the Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who used to passionately surf and bike, said her friends, "sensely dead" and "refuted life".
In April 2007, his father, Terrence Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle's daughter was confronted with his stepfather, who ended his statement in a letter, "I've always tied him up and closed his eyes.
I wasn't sexually harassing you.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, "He's a very strange fetish, and I'm sure it was terrible for his victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim's suicide.
But the fact that if you didn't do that, the case might never have been brought before the court."
The judge added: "I would like to draw attention to the effect of Stephanie's parents on the daughter of the crime you committed over the years.
If this was not done, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman."
Important data loss officer has been charged
According to BBC's knowledge, the government officer who has forgotten strictly secret documents on a train in June is charged with violations of the secrets of his office.
The man's experts were posted from the Ministry of Defence when he left two strictly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were transferred to the police.
This is the lowest accusation of breaches of the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional action.
Frank Gardner, a reporter from the BBC Ministry of Homeland Defence, said that the step was surprising a lot of people in Whitehall.
"They thought the Ministry of Defence and the government would treat the case as an internal matter," he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed was charged under paragraph 8.2 of the Act. This paragraph concerns the preservation of information.
The Public Prosecutor suggested that the charges against the officers are represented by Metropolitan Police because of his relatively sensitive work with regard to the United Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost were also covered by secret surveys on Al-Qaida and the ability of the Iraqi army.
Monday, the decision was informed and moved from his home to an unknown place.
Housebuilding cooperatives pay B&amp;B account
The UK housing cooperatives can count on an invoice of more than 80 million GBP after saving the Bradford &amp; Bingley bank.
The government spent 14 billion pounds to protect deposits from Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use money from deposit holders, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, Chairman of the Housebuilding Couple Association (BSA), Adrian Coles says it's annoying that companies and members have to pay.
The repayment of the 14 billion important loans will ultimately take place after the reimbursement of Bradford &amp; Bingley’s mortgages.
However, in the meantime, the accumulated interest will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Destruction System of Financial Services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing cooperatives also belong to them.
It's annoying that institutions that have been taking care of so far must now pay the accounts of institutions that were much less precautionary.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that all companies have to pay the amount of deposits that they own. The companies share 18% of the costs.
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, the amount of the loan will reach 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to put an end to the payment of the first-year interest rate of 81 million pounds.
Adrian Coles, director of the trade union of housing companies, told BBC that the measure was considered unfair.
"It is disastrous that institutions have to pay the accounts of less precautionary institutions which have been careful during the recovery of the housing market."
According to the BSA, no company has been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
"We need to examine this case in all respects in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and members from the significant amount of account," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 shall cover 7 months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, a full-year interest will be paid, which could even be twice the current.
Since housing cooperatives are self-aid organisations without shareholders, Members will eventually have to pay the account through higher fees or lower interest on deposits.
The milk price increases by five penny per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company announced that by Monday, it would increase the wholesale price of milk by five pence per litre.
This year, this second price increase has been since the two-pence increases in February and the survey carried out by a consultant company.
The resellers themselves decide whether to transfer price increases to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed in 2002.
They rejected the application of the former Member of the Bangladesh Parliament to defend on parole
The Bangladesh Court rejected the application of former MEP Sheikh Hasina for protection on parole, which means they can be arrested when she returns to the country.
His attorney said that the court refused to defend him on the parole against the accusation that he was blackmailed by a businessman during his parliamentary term (729.700 dollars).
This case is just one of the many corruption charges brought against him.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released for bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina has to return to Banglades for the next few weeks, but the Awami League demands that the temporary government of the country supported by the army give her full freedom first.
According to reports, although being conditionally freed to go abroad for treatment, the conditions of free footing do not clearly reveal that you can maintain your freedom when you return to the country.
His lawyers say that he will now appeal at the Supreme Court against the judgment of the Appeal Court.
"The Appeal Court dismissed Sheikh Hasina's application for a warranty by not having to be required because she was already temporarily set free and is involved in foreign treatment," we learned from Rafique-ul Huq's attorney.
"We're going to appeal against the decision of the appeal court."
According to his lawyers, he needs protection on parole to return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after 17 October.
Last year, he was arrested after the interim government supported by the army took over the power, but he was released from prison in June to go abroad for treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerning the Afghan polio vaccination programme
According to the UN, nearly 200 000 children in Afghanistan remained out of the recently organised polio vaccination programme due to violence against Talibans.
Last week, vaccination activities organised in six provinces of the United Nations.
However, they said that for security reasons, they could not reach children living in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
According to a UN speaker, this was done despite the promise made by the Taliban: they will not attack or hinder the work of thousands of vaccination staff.
BSkyB’s appeal for ITV has been rejected
The appeal of BskyB was rejected against the decision of the Competition Committee which ordered its interest in the rival television tax, ITV.
The Competition Court required BSkyB to reduce its share of the ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
The Committee previously concluded that BSkyB’s share of the company would hinder competition and lead the company to unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 and effectively prevented NTL, which has been renamed to Virgin Media, in buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Office announced that the share purchased by BSkyB from ITV would jeopardise the independence of ITV by encouraging the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
The Director of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's supervision were all opposed to buying.
The BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in ITV participation was an insignificant and disproportionate approval, particularly in view of the fact that BSkyB stated that he would be willing to give up his voting rights.
Another investigation of the case of the U.S. State Attorneys
The U.S. State Attorney General has appointed a special attorney to investigate the management of nine US Attorneys in 2006.
The step followed that the report prepared by the head Superintendent of the Justice wall criticised the decisions of government officials.
The report criticised the officials of the White House, the legislators and the former state attorney Alberto Gonzalest.
The investigation was ordered because it was fearful that the prosecutors were saved from political consideration.
Nora Dannehy, Special Attorney, will now investigate whether the officials who were listening to the investigation tried to stop justice by lying.
"Serious charges on possible crime have not yet been investigated, and have not been cleared," said Glenn Fine, Chief Inspector.
One of the main suggestions was to appoint a special attorney, who has the power to testify to the witnesses.
The series began by removing nine prosecutors from the US's legal wallet in December 2006.
At that time, they said that the prosecutors were dismissed because of their weak performance.
However, it became apparent later that the state prosecutors lost had no worse assessment than many other colleagues, so many of them concluded that political considerations had been brought behind the discharges.
Some public prosecutors participated in the criminal proceedings of high-ranked Republicans Congress members, while others were not willing to participate in the investigation of complaints on electoral fraud against democrats.
The U.S. State Attorneys are investigating and conducting judicial proceedings under the authority of the government.
They can be saved at any time, but they can't be removed from their position for political reasons.
The head of the judiciary at the time, Alberto Gonzales, became the target of the attacks and finally resigned.
Many other officials in the judiciary also gave up their resignation.
In the report of the Chief Inspector, Gonzales has highly criticised his role in the case. According to him, the main state attorney is responsible for "principal responsibility" for the dismissal, for the role of "rejected" and "respectfully withdrawn" from the process.
Other officials - including Karl Rove, former assistant of the older Bush - criticise that they have not demonstrated cooperation during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's Epos has been commended
The rock star Meat Loaf will be commended for the epical hymnus "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer who takes over his special golden prize next week at the London ceremony said that it was an honor to honor.
The nine minutes, fifty seconds long, was the song of Meat Loaf in 1977, the album of the faculty garden.
Coldplay received most of the tickets for this year, in four categories, on the candidate list.
Paul Rees, editor of the Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and this is Bat Out Of Hell."
The song received by Jim Steinman needed a very big voice, and that sound was Meat Loafé.
The song started with an almost two-minute musical division.
It appeared as a small album in 1979 and reached 15th place on the slagger lists.
However, for almost nine years, Meat's album "Bat Out Of Hell" was present on the scarlists and then sold over 40 million copies of it.
Meat Loaf - with the real name Marvin Lee Aday - has recently suffered health problems. In 2003, he had surgery due to heart rhythm disorder after he collapsed on the stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel some concerts due to acute arthritis.
Later it turns out there was a cyst on his voice.
Unknown Grand City Street, which is often forgotten, and may be sold soon.
New York City has thousands of roads, circular roads and other sideways, some of them are famous and others are merely practical.
However, many trained cab drivers and long-lived local residents would find it difficult to say where Extra Place is, mostly because they've never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village and heading north from First Street - without reaching second street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
Approximately 9 m wide and 36 m long and much more similar to a dust alley than to a main transport route.
There are no street boards.
Technically, you can't find it on a standard map.
But the street has admirers.
There he is, for example, the Avalon Bay, a builder of the newly built First Street Luxury Buildings.
He wants to repack the Extra Place and ensure that new building shops and butics can be accessed on a cleaner way.
Wonders of the street include the long-distance neighbours who were caught in the stinking street that this was the only remains of the past before the renovation of the area.
However, it is not in the interest of the owner of the street, the city building maintenance and development department.
This month, at a meeting of the Regional Management Committee of the district municipality, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the Committee would prefer the street to be managed by the city and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, Susan Stetzer, the district leader of the 3rd municipality body, reported.
"There are very few areas in the city's possession, and we want the extra Place to remain in the city," he said.
"We may come to proposals for renovation and management that Avalon can do, but we also want to guarantee that it is available to the public."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that he wanted to rebuild the small street and to supply seats. Some of these would be used by a coffee shop, which the builder is expected to hire a site.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, the spokesman of Avalon Bay, told me that although the company wanted to use the street, she wouldn't insist on possession.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this restless alley and transform it into a pleasant public hell," he said, adding that the city proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, the spokesman of the Building Housing Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was responsible for building development and not managing the buildings.
Compared to her more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has little historical significance.
Some say that in 1802, he received the name "the land of Senki" when Philip Minthorne's great property was divided among many of his children, and no one demanded the narrow earth band.
The punk-rock monument closed in 2006, the back entrance of the CBGB opens to Extra Place, and the street is perhaps the most remarkable photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a wonderful scene," said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"He was with garbage, worn chickens, barrels and poster pieces, and wooden leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how they own East Village in the middle class, are opposed to the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, whatever modest it is, must remain in the possession of the community.
Others mention Extra Place as rare, which is a virtually unchanged part of the city and which must be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, the writer of a blog entitled “The book of Siralmak, the bitter nostalgia of the city’s extinction” wrote a part of the story of Extra Place, published in the section "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author Brendan Gill wrote: "External Place is a narrow, small dead end which is even dark during the day, bound by rusty, iron storage doors and spalting windows, and where the wind wears weekly newspapers in the channels."
Apart from some exceptions, the street looked the same way a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the street, by the back door, which used to lead to the CBGB, and now belongs to a higher priced clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls, and there was a empty, 0.75 litre beer bottle lying next to a dumped, fresh paper pillow.
Some walkers said they rarely remember the Extra Place, but they think they could use the renovation.
Fields told me that some people think they underestimate the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"I spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, nasty and disgusting places," he said.
Discussion of two-linguistic education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
The education observer, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi, will discuss the opinions of candidates on two-linguistic education in this section.
Lance T. Izumi, experienced researcher at the Pacific Public Policy Research Institute and leading director of education research, is the "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school choice" book.
Voters from Spanish areas are not easy.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are also included.
According to Obama's campaign, "Afro-American and Spanish lip students are much less likely to obtain a diploma than white students," and that is true.
In order to overcome such performance differences, Obama's education plan supports explicitly, inter alia, transitional two-linguistic education for students in English.
At the same time, the question for Obama is whether its commitment to two-linguistic education, which focuses on school education in non-English, will increase its interest in combating major performance differences.
Consider, for example, the Sixth Street Prep contracted general school in the east of Los Angeles county.
Most of the school students have Spanish lips and low income.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, learn English.
However, 100% of the fourth grades achieved excellent results during the 2008 state mathematics test.
Similarly, it is fascinating that 93% of the fourth grades completed excellent English language and literature exams.
This incredible performance was not valued by the instrument Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repeating, practicing, continuous evaluation of skills and rejecting objections.
In addition, and that is what Obama should consider, Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the principle of education is the "full incorporation" of students studying English in the language environment.
The essence of the incorporation method is the use of English almost exclusively in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes the two-linguistic education, said, "We've had a great success in walking into a classroom, and he wouldn't know who the student who arrived 12 months earlier from Mexico was."
"It's working," he said, "It's working for us."
Would Obama set schools such as Sixth Street Prep as a follow-up example to the schools of other students in Spanish lips and students in English?
The progress achieved by the school should be made clear, but because of the education policy of its own party (the National Education Associations have long supported the two-linguistic education) and as it is consistent with the two-linguistic education itself, we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants should learn in English, Obama has recently expressed an appreciative statement about the issue when he said that people should not be so concerned about the "only English merit".
Instead, he said, "You should get your kids to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to achieve a reduction in the differences between the results, you should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and taking them into nothing.
The price of oil fell steep due to renewed concerns about the economy
On Monday, oil prices fell steeply because of the concerns that the American rescue plan for financial markets will not be able to bring the economy back to life.
The securities of crude oil returned by seven percent to $99.80 in the morning on the New York Trade Exchange.
Prices have been reduced by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, the stock exchange has been triggered by the financial confusion in Wall Street, and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached EUR 145.29 per barrel in July, they returned to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month before the immense uncertainty of the financial markets was restored.
On Monday, the concern re-enforced investors even after the Congress leaders announced: this weekend they managed to agree on the economic rescue action, which is the greatest in history.
The news has been shadowed by the concerns that the financial crisis will not end for a long time.
In the latest events of the crisis that emerged, Citigroup will buy the Washovia Corporation's banking business, announced on Monday by the government.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly ruled out the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of desperate weekend talks, it seems that the rescue operation has failed to bring up the stock exchange trading interest."
As the economic situation is worsening, it is also expected that the demand for goods, such as oil, will decrease.
"The future of the market for capital, interest rates and exchange rates has become uncertain worldwide," wrote Deutsche Bank an analyst to investors.
"We think that the market for goods will not be avoided by "epidomic".
From the point of view of the stock exchange, the most important question is the extent to which the American "disease" affects the whole world, especially China."
As the slowdown in economic growth reduced oil consumption, banks' analysts ran out of their expectations for the next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices by 20% for 2009.
With the bravure of the second quarter, the team set up a record
After spending more time in the Jets field than anyone else, Shaun Ellis playing the defensive himself in position, in the past eight seasons, thought he'd seen everything.
But then he watched the opening of the second quarter on Sunday when the Jets turned a game without a point into a sensational game.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals was fully compliant with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback 12-yard touchdowns gave Laveranues Coles a perfect advance for a afternoon during which their cooperation developed significantly.
Favre gave Coles two touchdown passports in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell after each other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I wasn't sorry for the trouble," said Favre about all the passes given to Coles.
"That's a hell of a player.
We've been able to communicate well with each other, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing balls, the defense stopped Cardinals control, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, playing the cornerback position, caught a bad shot and threw it back with 32 yards, which reached touchdown.
Eric Smith, the Safety player, touched another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to kick the ball out of Warner's hand.
This could have been the most amazing game in the game.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and the Jets got it, Jay Feely 20-yards field got kicked, it sets the 34:0 result.
That was the best result of the Jets so far achieved within a quarter.
When they asked the Jets coach Eric Mangin to characterize the game's ludicrous nature, he said, "The second or the third quarter?"
When they told him that both -- in the third quarter, Cardinals acquired 21 points so that Jets didn't get one -- Mangini said, "I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third.
We got a lot of points in a short time."
The resting Gebrselassie will break his own world record
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many people think it was the best medium and long run ever, when he broke his own world record on Sunday in Berlin, and he became the first to run the 42.2 km in 2 hours 4 minutes.
On the convenient flat track, with victory over 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on the previous result of 2:04:26 last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, the 26th world record of the career of Gebrselassie was established in a variety of areas that, from 1500 meters to marathon, almost all the way, won or achieved a world record.
Last month, Gebrselassie ignored the Olympical Marathon in Peking, fearing, which may have proved to be too cautious, that air pollution would further aggravate asthmatic problems.
Instead, he appointed me to the Berlin Marathon.
Under almost perfect conditions, at daytime, at the beginning of 9 °C and at the end of 13 °C, Gebrselassie won on Sunday, incredibly, with a speed of 2 minutes per 56 seconds.
Since the marathon runners, such as Gebrselassie, and Paul Tergat in Kenya, turned to the longer distances, the marathon record has declined more than two minutes in the last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa in 1998 won with a result of 2:06:05 in Berlin.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago, his legs were cramped and he couldn't train for two weeks.
It's obvious that she was awakened and not rusty during the forced rest.
"I'm so glad," said Gebrselassie to the reporters.
"Everything developed perfectly.
I started re-training a week ago, and today I had doubts, but finally everything was fine."
He received some criticisms, especially from Kenya, the rival of Ethiopia, that he uses too many tools in his competitions, usually avoids many world-famous marathon runners, relying on his careers, and puts world records in front of the competition spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces the greatness of Gebrselassie in the long run.
On Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the point of departure with four runways in Kenya, under 1:02:04.
Two front-line runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the runways were exhausted.
Not much more than 4,8 kilometers before the target, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with a last sprint, who was second targeted at 2:05:36, 5 minutes to improve his individual best.
Kamathi is the third person under 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, has closed a remarkable year with the seventh fastest victory of 2:19:19.
The world party is held by the British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
In the past spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko won the marathon in London with a result of 2:24:14.
He couldn't participate because of the alleged back injury of the Olympiad in Peking, but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin marathon, where he improved his individual peak by five minutes.
He gained the competition with a smart calculation: first he let a group of four people from the Ethiopia and Kenyans break forward and get a major lead, then after about 30 km of running.
The Ethiopian Ashale Tafa Magarsa reached its second goal at 2:21.31, while the Kenya Helena Kiprop was the third with a result of 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and trials of black people
A quiet small town, where the pride and complications of the African-American life experience have been born, is located a few miles away from everything that shines, loud and powerful.
Eatonville, the first pure black city that was integrated into the country, and was the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "The five lakes, three croquet tracks, 300 brown leather, 300 good swimmers, many guajava and two schools without prison."
It's a pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have already been to the annual Zora Festival. The celebration series in Eatonville is held to honor Hurston, the most famous female writer in Harlem Renaissance.
However, in many respects, the city described by it and made it touristic, which is also included in the Florida Roadbook of the Federal Authors of the Times.
It was as independent, dignified and closed as Hurston wrote in the 1930s when, according to his writing, the florida, the city black people often refused to share their true thoughts with white people who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing."
Even in that year, when the black presidential candidate Barack Obama encourages an open debate on racial issues, many people are disloyal to the eyes of outsiders.
"We look at how to tell our story," reported the 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here all his life, and a member of the oldest church in town.
"You have to say it nicely."
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, the historical model for black outs is a community of nearly 2400 people where poverty indicators reach the national average doubles.
Partly a literary node, and partly an example of the result of American slavery, sometimes looked down, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture, which blossoms in the shadows of oak trees.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the people here are proud and defending at the same time.
And the picture of Eatonville has been important since Zora, which is what everyone calls Hurston.
In the honest, strong dialect books - like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) presented his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the trip to Florida have transformed the city, which is next to Route 17. This road leads from the long-lasted centre of Florida to one of the locations of black history and human dramas.
Hurston, who was brave in life and literature, like drums, introduced his readers to Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke's business, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: "We find the modern public school on the right of the road, brown on the basis of a white spot with well-decorated courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller cares, although he can barely write and read."
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband, and he wrote that Lee Glenn was selling all kinds of drinks, and anything that could be needed in temporary accommodations.
So, a few hundred words of Hurston brought Eatonville into a relationship with autonomy, but at the same time with inscription, remarry and sex.
Clearly, the Fodor's guidebook was presented differently.
We didn't really like this description.
"Zora said things like they were," reported the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who made them immortal by quoting the crisp songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered as the live special who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville in Florida.
The 77 - year - old August Franklin recalled that when Hurston rushed into the city, he usually arrived unannouncedly in Chevrolet, smoking, and in long pants, in a city where the people are still proud of their dignity.
Most people were enthusiastic, said Franklin, but a lot of people did.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Franklin.
However, on the terrace of the Lake of Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added in his chair: "Never remains too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer published again.
It seemed that, together with most of the world, Eatonville forgot about it.
Although he was ever a popular writer, his contemporary partner, Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s was buried in an insignificant grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he used to live.
In Eatonville there were no significant memorials or great public readings.
"I don't think you've understood how much you've enriched the world or what you've left us" said Valerie Boyd, author of the 2003 edition of the Hurston Biography, the book "Browned in the Rainbow".
The turning point came in 1980.
The officials of the Orange county wanted to build a five-band road through the city instead of the two-band highway, the Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the life of the community.
The enlarged Orlnado has already entered the western border of the city on the Interstate 4 highways linking the States.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still walking after a difficult history.
Among other things, the enforced integration has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950 ’ s, racial blending struggles attracted the community to hatred.
"At all, a bunch of white boys came over and they threw the seats on the side of the road with narance and other things," said Franklin.
"There was a lady who died in this.
They threw a grenade out of a car."
In his letter to the newspaper "The Orlando Sentinel" in 1955, Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court to prescribe violent integration, so he said about the decision called "Brown v Board of Education": "In fact, he's insulting, respecting my species."
Today, people say that school desegregation was positive in some respects, weakened the reconciliation of the Eatonvilles and undermined the confidence of young people.
"The black children are used to kill them - that's what I remember - the man hugged his teacher in the morning and the evening," reported N.Y.Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, Managing Director of the Nonprofit Organisation called Meg Eatonville Community.
"That took until the students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, there were cultural differences between us," said Nathiri.
However, human rights have helped many other Zora Neale Hurston rise - in black writers, actors and artists who have overlooked the prestigiousness, as he did, with such positive self-confidential confidence and lines as follows: "How can anyone take himself away from the pleasure of my company!
That's incomprehensible for me."
In 1975 Alice Walker marched to Hurston's unsignificant grave and began to fight to give her reputation back.
Five years later, a recognised Hurston biography written by Robert E. Hemenway was placed on the pillars of the bookstore, which re-established it into American examples.
The road construction project would have started just when Eatonville's most famous daughter again was at the center of attention.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors looked at him as a savior.
In 1988, the community started organizing a Hurston festival to show us what would destroy the county with its main path.
Thousands of fans have arrived for the opening event two years later, and many have come back to the celebration every January.
A few years later, the county stopped its road construction proposal.
"As a result of the five bandages of the main road, the community has relived, linked to full speed, which means real civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd made it easier to say, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project has helped to change the image of the city itself.
The number of people living outside the city, such as Rachelle Munson, who started to go to church in 1993, and the locals began to reassess the past.
Eatonville was entered in the national historical list in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-level library (naturally known as Hurston) was opened on the re-enclosed and built Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville continues to have Florida's cocktail egg: it's not just 10 km from the centre of Orlando, but sometimes it's like a suburban sideway during the summer rain; it's as small as the 27 black families founded in the 1880s.
(Now 90% of the inhabitants are black.)
They still welcome outsiders who come here looking for the story of Eatonville.
Most interviews are subject to prior authorisation, and some things, such as the oldest fresco of Eatonville, painted by a white man and depicted black people on earth, should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, including the self-confidential teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to our lively red, are afraid that their separate community is misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has become increasingly wide, the pride of the hometown has also increased.
In particular, young people are increasingly viewing Eatonville as Hurston saw his own tree: wonderful, problems and not even better, nor worse, as proud, creative, vigilant, foolish and confused as other race and ethnic groups in America.
He has a genuine civil bond with Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to the local government or the police to work that he thinks they need help.
And it seems that younger people also learned how to characterize Eatonville, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twin: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"The majority of those who just travel here think that this town is nothing compared to the others," said Alondra Kenon recently after the worship of God on a Sunday.
"But if someone stops and takes some time to get to know his history, it's a very beautiful city."
We all speak the language of finance here in New York
Nothing on the surface has changed.
If the tourists didn't care about the newspaper shop and the huge TV showers at Times Square, I wouldn't notice they're in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with glass walls, bees-shaped offices over their heads, bankers and risk fund managers who hold New York under their control have been living the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers are still running through their metal tea cars on the walks, delivering trays loaded with muffin to breakfast meetings.
There are still men with Spanish lips hanging between the block houses, carrying as a human mud, with 50 outlets hanging a sleeve like their shoulders.
The office workers are still in line for their sweet breakfast bake cars on the stove, and it is still impossible to take a cab from 4 to 7 a.m. on a regular day.
I didn't feel any crisis until I decided to open a new bank account on Thursday afternoon, despite all the alarming news.
However, I intentionally planned to take care of the matter in my local account of JP Morgan Chase bank in the afternoon rest, but I had about 20 people in the line.
It is not from the wall of the bank store, where money can be booked or paid, but from the customer service bar where the older customers order a checkbook, tourists are asking for directions to the Macy's store and where new customers open a bank account.
Many in front of me - I learned it later from Starr, the "to me ordered" banker - they were in line with the same intention as I did.
However, unlike me, they have already taken their money from smaller banks in their homes, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from our so-called depots (such as housing cooperatives), credit cooperatives and small-town wallets that work in only one state and allegedly treat their customers as family members.
Last year, 15 of these banks went down quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with 327 billion dollars of capital, went into bankruptcy, and when the New Yorkers started home on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, earned a saving of $440 billion.
The offices and shop workers ahead of me, fearing another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe shelter, to the bank that makes most of the capital injections on Wall Street.
People in New York have become an expert in finance in the past few weeks.
A woman on the phone at the local Chinese store spoke about Lehman Brothers' bank bank bank banking and his giant-looking CEO Dick Full as if she complained about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a man in uniform for the block of my apartment, has changed the subject of a supervisor of 50 years old, not Brad and Angelina, or my food delivery, as usual.
He said to me after I went to the bank, "I invested all my saved money in money market instruments.
I've chosen, I'm not risking it."
Moslems were disgraceed by graves while Austria went to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, the right-hand Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian right-hand party, Vlaams Belang, participated in a demonstration in Antwerp, January 17, 2008, on Thursday, which was presented by the organization called "Islamic Destroying Ellen".
They were drawn by symbols of traffic boards that drew mosques with a red line.
According to the police, extreme right extremists are responsible for the disgrace of the Austrian Muslim cemeteries, which took place in the same weekend when the extremist right parties had significantly progressed at national parliamentary elections.
There were over 90 graves of serious damage to the train cemetery next to Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as David’s star, on some graves, but according to the investigators, they were just trying to hide their extreme motives from the hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is related to the elections in some way.
A spokesman of the local Islamic community said that "they were deeply frightened" after the ceremony of the Muslim religious month, shortly before the end of Ramadan.
In the meantime, Austria is conducting a conscience test after yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance is right.
The two extreme right parties, which obtained almost 30% of the votes, were campaigned for the future of the Freedom Party and the Alliance for Austria, for a strong anti-migration law, and some of their critics have been posted as an alien hater.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Freedom Party who acquired more than 18% of the votes, expressed a campaign against headsets and buffalos as well as a rejection against allegedly related foods.
At the final meeting of the Party in Vienna, he spoke of the "European brotherhood" to prevent the strengthening of Islam.
He wants both parties to ban the construction of mosques and minares by claiming that they are the political symbols of the ongoing isolation of Austria and Europe.
According to public opinion surveys and analyses carried out directly after the elections to win a better edge, the change was largely due to the young voting base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter was banned from a foreign trip.
Garry Glitter, convicted of sexual assault on children, a known rock star was banned by the court from his trip to France and Spain.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months after notifying him of his intention to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police received a ban on the journey by Thursday after she submitted to the court evidence of the sentences of sexual violence against the children brought against Glitter.
Glitter, called Paul Gadd, was not involved in the Ashford Magistrates trial in Kent, but represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court officer said: "On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent police filed an application to the Ashford Magistrates Court for the prevention of the travel of Paul Gadd to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of its intention to travel abroad because it was bound by the law on persons involved in the register of sexual offenders.
You must inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
He also has to inform the police at least seven days before the planned trip.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to five years of imprisonment.
The Kent police told me that they don't want to talk about individual cases inside Glitter county and where they might be.
We learned from the field police spokesman: "The Kent police are doing everything in their power to protect children within the country and abroad.
"We think it's easier to control someone if you don't leave the United Kingdom, because we have a comprehensive system here to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The main task of the Kent police is to protect Kent's population, and through close cooperation, we will continuously monitor the conduct of persons who are involved in the record of sexual offenders and who live in the county to minimise the potential risks of the population."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after 27 months spent in a prison in Vietnam for rape of a 10 and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he fled to Bangkok, where he should have moved to a plane to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The countryside authorities did not pass the passport check, so he finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to enter the country, so they flew back to Bangkok, where officials of the country police and the immigration agency insisted on returning to Great Britain.
Finally, on 22 August, he arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3, and remained there until David Corker, his lawyer, went to the Court of West London, Uxbridge, because, in accordance with Scotland Yard's request, he was entered in the register of sexual offenders under a court order.
Glitter spent four months in prison for the possession of photographs of child rape in the United Kingdom in 1999.
According to a source of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State, welcomed and welcomed the fact that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I'm not doing the photos on the stage because I want to introduce the artist on a personal page" Günther Bauer Photography
No decoration, no haircuts, no dancing shoes.
From the great masters of Flamenco, without the excitement of the action: to get to know the ordinary faces of dancers.
The artist on the one hand.
On the other hand, the common man.
And these two sides can not be separated, except in the moments of the intrinsic, distant audience, when we can find a personal move, we can capture the depth of a captured view, or we can be impressed with the beauty of the improper, but expressing hand of an artist who is designed to act on a non-satellite stage.
In the German Günther Bauer Flamenco-people series, the theatres of singers, dancers and guitars are combined with this less common side of masters.
Through the photos, Flamenco shows its specific iconography from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of the month of Flamenco Photography, " reflects the increasing international importance of flamenco every day" - believes the author, adding that Flamenco-people could be the person, since the pictures were seen by the observer in such a way that these images are not typically imaged by artists.
These people on the street are artists who are able to take passion, sadness, joy on the stage... and rob the audience.
At the same time, photography on the stage is not suitable to capture their personality.
Their identity and character are living at the deepest.
I wanted to create an inner atmosphere that allows me to inherit the personality of the greats of Flamenco."
The Cante de las Minas festival launched a long trip to Bauer in 1997, making portraits of flamenco singers, guitars and dancers with a record camera.
These portraits quote classic photography thanks to the camera and theme selection.
However, the use of the various stylistic tools is interrupted by the traditional image illustrations and suggests modernity. The following thought reflects Bauer’s idea of flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, which, however, changes every day and always fascinating."
Not the dancing, not the singer or the music itself, much more the artist's personality, the character of the audience.
In the days, the main motive of the works in the El Photomata galleries is to look for the essential, artistic seam, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and display.
The known figures of Flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are marked by the metal collection of sixty artists.
The project also became a flamenco anthology, which will soon be issued with a album containing portraits presented in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portrait two years ago, to repeat the idea with the "portrait of veteran sports" series ("SportART project").
Although Flamenco-people's concept is slightly different from that, the photographer adds: "I love to photograph people, to know them and to enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, photography is the hardest thing to do with the portrait.
People who don't even know or who only take a few minutes to photograph.
But despite these circumstances, I am always trying to achieve my ideas as a photographer.
The exhibition, selected from the portraits of the contemporary flamenco, with the title Flamenco-people, can be seen in El Photomatta Gallery, which is located in the parallel calle de la Mata 20 of the Alameda de Herccules, until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he's working on is "prepared blindness"
The scene and the act are still unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also working on writing a new novel. The novel's head is an Irish nationalist, Roger Casman, who lived 20 years in Congo and Amazónia.
The bookwriter at the Hay Festival Segovia event yesterday also confessed to his current work as "prepared blindness" and "all signs indicate that you shouldn't write" the novel.
"If I was smarter, I wouldn't, but I'll do it, and I hope I'll make a point at the end" -- he closed his speech at the festival of ideas, thought and opinion exchanges, which hosted hundreds of writers, historians and journalists for four days in the city of Aqueduct, and thousands of visitors.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the literary celebration, and he also replaced the hopes.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival award voted by the participants, a old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Common Friend". His presentation was filled with Juan Bravo's theatre.
The audience accepted it after the greeting of Felix Romeo. The hour of which the Peruian writer had a fascinating memory potential and a great amount of humor told how it developed from the special adventure of his reader passion and the desire of life to live; how the inspiration was overwhelmed by an inspirational method of writing, vigorous documentation, many repairs and rewriting; how it affected his invitations to the writers Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what memories are based on his history.
The Latin-American novelist acknowledged that it is impossible to measure or to show that books change our lives, but he added: "I do not think literature is pure entertainment or vague experience," because it affects people and make them think, so he asked the writers not to let their tears be seduced and bear responsibility for their profession.
Because of the stiefling weather, the farewelling of Pozoblanco is shorter, the horsefighters are missing.
Traditionally, the horsefighting of the Pozoblanco holidays was deleted from the show yesterday morning after the future rider torreadors found the Arena terrace unfit for the wardal.
As a result, the Committee decided, in agreement with Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, to stay behind the bullfight.
The weather revolved the celebration series thoroughly, since two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, he stayed with the second bullfight because of the rain.
The leading players, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista Castilblanco, would have fought with bulls.
So they only held bullfight on Friday.
The winner Daniel Luque became, brought three ears home as a trophy.
At the same afternoon, he received a ear as a trophy through two bulls of Alejandro Talavante, rather than due to his own performance.
After that, El Juli followed, who did little to alter the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable trip with the second bull, most of the audience was able to get out of the razor.
In the valve of a two tons of abdomen truck attempted to escape from road control
Four o'clock in the morning, fifty minutes.
Basque Regional Police carry out traffic checks in the administrative area of Armiñón (Alava).
The authority stops a van in which the two of you are traveling, and the passengers are trying to escape the action.
The shipment, more than two tons of abdomen, was unprecedented.
The detectives hunted the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A.A. J., reported by the Basque Government Department of Internal Affairs.
The man in custody is charged with drug trafficking and falsification.
The case took place in the administrative area of Armiñón, where the staff of the Alava Transport Supervision were carried out on the N-1 highway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas and then left the inspection site.
The detectives hunted him, then the vehicle stopped on the stop zone a few miles away, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forest area.
Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after examining the Iveco Daily brand, she booked its shipment, 2178 kilograms of abdomen.
The occupant has been transported by police bodies filling the back part of the vehicle to carry out a more thorough investigation and to measure the drug.
In addition, during the inspection, it has been demonstrated that the vehicle’s fake plate does not match the data contained in the van’s papers, and that the arrested person is therefore subject to a procedure for the falsification of public documents.
Basque Regional Police continues to investigate the arrest of the other suspect, which, as we have mentioned, has escaped the highway and, on the other hand, is to determine the origin of the detained drug.
The 28-year-old accused, A.A.J., was sent to the police to conduct the necessary interrogation, and then the court measures began within a few hours.
Heather Locklear was arrested because he was under the influence of the drug.
Heather Locklear, the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend by the police in Santa Barbara (California) because she was under the influence of the medicine.
According to a witness, he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange manoeuvres, said one of the speakers of the People magazine for traffic surveillance in California.
According to the witness, at 16 o'clock 30, Locklear pushed the gas to the floor, lit the engine, tried to leave the parking lot in front and backwards, and went through his sunglasses several times in the back.
Shortly later, the eyewitness, who probably didn't recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also informed the police, 'cause he was worried about Locklear's life.
When the police arrived, the actress sat in her car, which partially paralyzed the traffic on the highway.
"He seemed like Zavart," so the patrols took him to a specialized centre for drug and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was co-operating and alcohol was almost immediately excluded, and the spokesman also said that according to the first impression of the officers, they thought that Locklear was under the influence of the medicine.
Locklear was arrested and suspected under the influence of an unidentified agent. He was transported to the local prison around 19 hours, where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of a sanatorium in Arizona two months ago, where he was treated with anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the IU (United Left) and Annalus Federation to deal with the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, Secretary-General of the IU and the United Left, said today that the regional Federation of the Order will decide on the case of former Youth and Sports Counsellor of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after he was accused of bringing his family to benefit from his position in a disproportionate manner.
"In these things, I am a federalist far from here, and this case is indeed the responsibility of the Andalusian organization," Llamazares pointed out the procedure that the party should apply against the former member of the City Council in Sevilla.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that, when investigating irregularities that could have been committed by Silva, the "transparentity" must be observed: "The IU has always been on the ground to ensure that cases of this kind are as transparent as possible."
He added that training was part of "the strict ethical code for public employees."
"Mary blood", the epic work of Garci
The work of Benito Pérez Galdós was inspired by José Luis Garci, who quotes the famous anti-France rising of the Spanish in the blood of Mayus, which is the most magnificent form of his filmography, with its budget of about 15 million euros.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the manpower and social analysis he was always admired in his work by a well-known novel writer. Together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, he told Garci to the folk audience of the actors today.
It is presented in the cinema on Friday for more than two and a half hours, and later Telemadrid will perform as a mini series for more than four hours.
Jose Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdós' literature, made this film of his childhood dream. This is thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, because he entrusted it three years ago to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on 2 May. Garci accepted the call on the basis of the story.
The 15 million budget was financed entirely by the Autonomous Region of Madrid, and Garci was given a special opportunity: he could have introduced "the disrupted Spanish, who were wrongly behind the wrong leader, because the fight for independence has led the country to a huge negligence by the rule of Ferdinand VII".
However, the director expressed his regret for not counting the budgets of Alatriste or Goya Phantoms that were thrown over the doubles of Mayu's blood, which made it necessary to leave some scenes out of the script, which, like many other times, are recorded together with Horacio Valcárcell.
So, the director of the Relaunch started his usual working method, he took the scenes with the actors who started the tests before the shooting. Casting wasn't, because Garci thinks it's "smoking" and because, as he said, "the directorship is part of the the theater and the cinema to find out what's going on in the industry we're working on."
Several actors of majus' blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, didn't first come to his camera.
Garci, who can be proud of four Oscars and an Oscar Prize, believes that the Spanish Academy represents Spain this year, i.e. the Mayus blood, the Seven French Billiary Tables and none of the finally selected blind sunsets represents the young generation of the Spanish cinema, "the dead one should be presented," said.
Garci isn't charged with this movie.
"In fact, you think you're working for the afterlife, and then you realize that happiness is the only thing that matters, and finally you're happy to have another film done," Garci says with a 30-year-old professional career running behind her back.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Seville dancer Tortola Valencia
A flamenco dancer in Seville reminds me of a dancing dancer in Seville.
Carmen Tortola from the father of Catalán (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Annalus mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela) moved to London when she was born in Triana quarter and was three years old.
He was a free dance artist and an expert in the East dances.
During his moving life, he fought as a pioneer for women's equality, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against the dragon against the freedom of women.
He blew up a dance and aesthetic revolution in war in Europe, and his life amazed Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pep Gamboa, he offered me the attention of Tórtola, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said, "It is not our goal to tell her life story, but to take her soul.
I remembered flamenco styles about his dancing titles.
For example, the "dancing of a pill" of guajira or the "dancing of a snake" is the tango.
"She's dancing, and others think it's my style," she says.
The performance is lighted by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda is now singing again in Isabel's performance after the door opened; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, exceptionally wanted to work with a former disciple.
"Matilde shapes the older Tortolate, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to request, I'm very honored to show up in my piece."
In addition, the musical directors and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón singers; El Pajaro kicker, Rafa El Viola, and Juanfra Juárez actor, who, with love of the true diva, is always playing a permanent character.
The play also presents a large part of the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels Europe and reaches far-reaching lands, including India, the United States or Italy.
"I wanted to make a memory of him because his personality had a great influence on his own age, but he is no longer known and even less appreciated his work," said Bayón.
The performance starts tonight at 20 a.m. at the Lope de Vega theater.
At the end of Triennium, it's also published "The journal of a newly married poet"
In May 1916, Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008), which was organized by the Regional Government Culture Committee of Andalusia at the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize and the anniversary of their two deaths.
Thus, the final time of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the re-issue of this work, the International Congress in New York, the Restauration of the Nobel Prize Monument Hall and the "Juan Ramón Jimenez: The bright summer tree". In May this exhibition, several awards were held and are scheduled to visit New York for the time of the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andaluz Regional Government has obtained a total of eight hundred copies of the journal of a newly married poet, illustrated by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most popular enantalus poets.
Without Paul Newman, America isn't that attractive.
"God sometimes boasts perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that."
The quote comes from the actress Sally Field who worked with Newmann in a film called victims of the sensation and reflects the shock and incapacity of Newman's death in the American cinema and throughout America.
But how hard it was for him to get Oscar.
Retired in 2007,
and was mostly ill,
But he's still shaking everyone's death.
"Sometimes it's impossible to put our feelings in words, and I've lost a good friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "that his existence made my life and this country better."
No one was afraid that it might be ridiculous or overreacting.
One of the heroes of the movies and home went away in a particularly dark period of fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When such difficult times are passed and many people lose their virtues easily and there are very few people we can look up to, Luis Cernuda does not have to be to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, he was depicting the plague of beauty and truth.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and defender of lost and won cases, from the foundation of the anti-drugs foundation for the memory of his first son who died of drug overdose until the creation of a domestic bio-food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that was hard to overcome his suicidal nutritional culture.
The surprising wave of admiration went across Hollywood, regardless of nationalities and origin.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, says it's not a man, but an era died with him.
Another Englandian, the Oscar Prize Sam Mendes, stated that his joint work with Newman clearly meant the peak of his career.
Russell Crowe, a bad boy from Australia, called Newman the greatest inspiration.
"He made the leak very high for all of us," said George Clooney, who may be one of the few who are attempting to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle today, demanding honesty and a private life away from serious and cameras.
It's not always easy if it's even possible in the middle of today's media jungle.
Still, there's someone trying, and Paul Newman's an example.
She was divorced once, but after that she lived in a loyal marriage with Joanne Woodward for 50 years, and she would certainly have had many occasions of infidelity.
"Why should I eat hamburgers somewhere else if the fried meat is home?" he was joking.
In heaven, he may be proud that his daughters on earth are also fans, which are not too common in America.
"She was not as proud as a faithful husband, a loving father, a caretaker's grandfather and a dedicated man-friendly role," he says.
The Olympical Ways of Madrid
Indeed, many of us dreams of a Madrid Olympics, and after 2012 failed, it may be 2016.
But, I'm asking if we're really ready for it?
Because if we get off the runway yesterday, I don't think so at all.
It was called a perfect competition, but I think it was the worst of many people I've ever been.
It was characterized by the mass of intellect, and if I had to appreciate it, and I would be the examiner, the result would clearly fail.
But let's get on with it and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the takeover of the number, because that's why they had to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem, but if you go sooner, at least get everything at the same time (including chips, to avoid posting in the later line).
That's not what happened.
First, only the number was given (first senselessness, only for this reason to go sooner) and (after the usual row), which is surprising, only S T-shirt (second senselessness, because I have XL in my size)!
What world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, did they decide to save the material and just buy cheaper, small T-shirts?
Anyway, these things are still breaking up compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Beyond the terrible early to go over the chip, it took 15 minutes to take a job in the line, and even the backpack had to be handed over.
The wait took longer than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a running race with over 11,000 people.
So, as it was expected, the competition started, and we haven't turned the backpack off, and when it finally worked out, it was worse.
In addition, the rain made the more than 40 minutes of waiting, followed by attempts to raise people and stand attacks.
I think by tomorrow, we'll get about 500 sure pneumonia, and some, including themselves, aren't getting our placement with the actual time, as I assume that the chip has wrongly fixed the departure.
If they were to ask me about the perfect runway, I wouldn't happen to think of that.
So I think we can continue dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft (virtual) is looking for reception
Microsoft has shown the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system at the upcoming Technology Conference, a kind of, not too intelligent, artificial intelligence that is capable of performing some of the basic tasks. For example, he can call a taxi (or, for Microsoft, a vehicle travelling in the company's territory) on the basis of information that has been heard from the conversation.
This "receptionist" can, through a camera and a form and facial recognition system, recognize the number of people in the room who are - in fact, also notices what clothes they wear - and hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group the present people on the basis of the discussions.
In the video, the reception lady identifies a third person, but she knows she's not a member of the company who's talking to her, and she's not a firm employee.
She'll ask if she's come to visit someone and make sure she'll be in a hurry to help you.
All of this without the blue big screen.
Impressive.
But, of course, it's the music of the future.
At present, the company has more important issues, such as the development of a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, many people have shattered that Microsoft's strategy has changed.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain less adjacent programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if the computers were only running the necessary programs instead of all the commercial garbage, the machines would be five times faster - Bravo, Steve, that's something.
They have invented Spanish wax, given that Microsoft has attached additional functions and extremes in all new versions so far to Windows.
The change of direction will return.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly in the background and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, I joined the theory that Google did the first step to become Windows competitor.
Many have rightly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is essential for the dialogue between hardware and software.
You play the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
He'll never disappear, but it'll have to be counted with the "death" of the operating system, not absolutely, but in a relative sense.
The declaration of Ballmer this week supports this thought.
People increasingly pay less attention to the operating system and more and more to the web browser.
The computer is only activated to open the Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more time for browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
What are most of the applications associated with the system then for?
Less is sometimes more.
And the Windows 7 is less, it's gonna have to be much less than the Vista.
Less heavy, less rigid, less complicated.
Microsoft's aim is to integrate its services on-line and finally provide an alternative to Google.
They all need this, and I will give an example of why.
This photo was made at the beginning of the month in Redmond.
The soda automatane calls them a poster to use the company's browser. "Your browser, our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft workers used Google for web browsers.
By the way, last week, there was also an announcement of the slip of the 7 new versions of Windows Mobile.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to dump Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 on the common market.
After all, your cell phone's working more and more as a computer.
But slipping, considering that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will make their business worse.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This is what Pablo Picasso wore in the diamond of Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Crusade, as well as one of the basic clothes of the mall.
And even if we are keeping it on the list of specialities, we can recall the peaceful figure of the maid of the migratory circus cackia.
But what are we talking about? Nothing but a male cotton strip, typically narrow and fingerless.
I mean, about the "dancing" as the English lips are called, but none of the competitors with Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can compete.
First of all, because of the elegant name, although it's only mentioned as "Marcel" among friends, which is due to sports, the legend is that Marcel Cerdan's boxer, Edith Piaf's lover, was named.
Marcel's excellent cotton material, unisex tail, its specific emblem, and its small (at least recognizable) Belgian flag. The latter is carried by the most prominent models hidden in the neck of the shirt.
But the Belgian company isn't just making tank tops.
Athletes, retro boxers, casmir cardigans, wool pants, marine shirts, baby clothes, mini rows - and we could still classify all the products of the company.
And they all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
Although it is regrettable that they must be dressed as underwear.
They're too good for that.
"I'd love to be a young mother, no matter who the father is."
He was very similar to his brother, but he managed to accomplish himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but it's full of energy.
At present, the Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica modeling is much more important than giving some pretty and beautiful girls their name to something.
It was present on the promotion of Mango's new location in Paris and on the transfer of the finest fashion fees sponsored by the Spanish company.
The warmth and gentleness that you receive is a flood of warmth.
What are you doing in Paris, actually?
We present the new autumn and winter collection of Mango, which my brother Penelope and I planned. In addition, we are participating in the second offer of Mango Fashion Awards and the galava ceremony for Valentino.
It's a pretty tight day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango's company, where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love movies in the '50s and '60s; we have taken a lot of things from there.
And then, I often walk the city and watch women dress, how to change and sort out their clothes - this is one of my favorite times.
You work as a danceress, actress and fashion designer.
That's what I think, but these three things are ultimately connected, because they have a lot of common points.
When I was a kid, I was interested in clothes, I was looking forward to go to my grandmother's, and I could sneak in my aunt's closets.
Well, that was you on the Canaan, almost got up with a cheerleader.
And then as a dancer, I always tried to listen to my dressing.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style for classes and tests, so we can have fun when we look in the mirror.
And in the actress role, you really identify your role when you get the costume.
See, it's all connected to everything, and with all due respect to designers and professionals.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I feel better than I've ever felt, I like the '30s.
I think that's what women are getting at, they've had enough experience, and they've made less mistakes in life.
And I'm not worried about the biological watch.
I've been doing what I want since I was a kid, and that's a great inner happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother because I'm born like a woman, and I'd like to be a young mom, and I'd never want to miss that.
As far as the future father is concerned, whoever it is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movie, and last year, you filmed more films that they haven't even introduced.
Yes, and I'm looking forward to coming out.
I, who started at the theater, I'm very uncomfortable and restless, I want everything right now, but of course I know it's impossible.
I can't wait to show you the last hour and the search for the grave of Christ.
I wonder what you'd say to them...
I understand that you debuted me on the runway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
Well, no, that's not true.
I didn't go up on the runway as a model.
Naomi Campbell has known me a long time, and she simply invited me to London for a charity show that she arranged for her own organization called women for a better world. I chose two Mango collections.
People don't even know how good Naomi is.
There's so many things going on about him, so I know him, and I can assure you that half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I'm always looking at the good side of his activity.
He asked me for a noble case for the fashion show, but if he wanted me to be headed, I'd do it.
If women in the third world have a fate, I don't know the impossible.
Regressive drunken leaders will be required to install "Alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior would, after three drunk driving violations, require the installation of a vehicle that would prevent the start of the vehicle if the driver is drunk or does not blow into the structure.
The proposal was presented in June and is currently being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which the pilot project will take one year.
Since the project is intended to return to the market, the driver will also have to participate in a repeat course on transport education.
In addition to the General Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Car Safety (FITSA) are involved in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of the carmen arrested repeatedly because of drunken driving are re-caring.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the level of alcohol in the air. If it is larger than permitted, or if the driver did not even blow into the device, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of an instrument of more than EUR 1000 would be borne by the instigator.
A relevant study in the USA in 2007 has shown that vehicles equipped with such instruments may reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could be saved by this rule every year.
The measure focuses on infringements for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from becoming a criminal offense,
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce, since the implementation of the legal reform is carried out in the ordinary way, while the necessary criminal reform requires a basic amendment of the law.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although in experimental mode some industrial and public vehicles have already been installed.
The House tomorrow votes on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which calls for the installation of the system in school buses - a French sample.
In Mexico, closed shoes
In English, at the time announced in the program, 17 hours at 40 minutes landed in the presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport, Mexico City, the Spanish Air Force Asturias Princess.
The sun was on its way down, but it was so hot that we could only use our hands as eyewitnesses to see the king's party coming out of the plane.
On the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other senior personalities stood.
I asked a cab driver on the street a few hours before he knew that the Spanish Princess Pair would arrive for official visits to the city.
- Great, well, it won't be a airport transfer for a long time today... she's from here or something...
No, no, sir, the lady was Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or so...
But the Mexican press, then he knows everything about the Princess of Asturias and the importance of their visit.
A lot of people are waiting for the red carpet of the hangar at the airport, the coron of the 27 Marine soldiers who protect the dignity.
The Prince shows up, smiling, sea blue clothes, and then the Princess, in her long hair, the wind is in her long hair, in her backed dress, but not in her usual toes-- they may have warned that Mexico City was threatened by a storm.
They stop and smile at the cameras for a moment, then enter the room where the official bet comes.
In the gates of their hotel, which is one of the four largest hotels in the city, they are awaited by the reporter of one of the Mexican soccer televisions.
The most valuable fashion fee
The most suitable place in the world is without doubt Paris, and the most sophisticated and decreasing fashion designers today are Valentino.
Mango has recently announced El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards' second offer, which aims to internationalise the young talents of fashion.
The main prize is EUR 300.000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first offer, saw his own design clothes in Mango, Paris boulevard Haussmann 54.
Besides, this company's second largest business in Europe and recently opened on 1335 square meters.
The biggest store is in London.
In the midst of the celebrations for Valentino and the celebration of the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner in Garnier Oper, Paris.
In the company of Chagalok, the presidential table of the galavadora Mango showed even spectacularly.
Nati, who came with a hard heart and sadness due to the recent death of his brother, wore one of the pieces of the Company and some of the breathtaking jewelry of the ELAH.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, had the guests entertained. He and Baroness Rotchil were so knightly at college that they finally stayed without a suit because they both gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz arrived in his own design pants and shirts, and at the dinner she wore a sexy, long black dress. On her night visit to Gaya Toledo, she was so involved in the ballet room that, remembering the old times, she was in the middle of one of the stairs and a grand plie style.
Inés Sastre did not participate in the palace visit, but before that, he showed some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning in Oliver Martinez - he'll be two metres tall, and John Travolta has arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris. He also brought his sheets and towels with him, and he said he didn't ask for any odor in the room.
Stars under Paris stars.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.

♪ Who talk in dreams ♪
Some kids talk at night.
I don't think of those who are freaking out and who are completely awake about what happened to them that day, but those who talk during the sleep.
At first, it may seem scary, but in fact, it is completely harmless.
This good-minded sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
Very common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure more people have been told he spoke at night.
The frequency may be completely rapsodic (e.g. only once in a high fever disease) or more systematic (a day, a week, or a monthly) and the child usually remembers nothing the next day.
The display cannot be relied on for one reason.
Often with other sleep disturbances, such as nightmares, night shaking, night-beding (enuresis nocturna) or sleeping, but this is not legal.
As mentioned above, a condition with high fever, or even a stress situation or an excitement of excitement may be inconvenient.
However, it has not been studied so far.
The intensity of speech is also very different.
It may be quiet, calm, inconsistent words, murmurs, but unlike that, it may occur in the form of yelling, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomena is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and the professional. The study may reveal whether there is a problem in the background that causes great anxiety and can also provide a solution.
As mentioned above, it is a well-being phenomenon, therefore, there is no cure unless it is associated with any other type of sleep disorder that can be handled (e.g. insomnia or stress).
But there are some things we can do, here's a pre-cooking measure:
Let us make sure that the child stays calm before sleeping.
Choose relaxing games and avoid watching a child viewing scary or aggressiver TV shows or series.
Children with a tendency to nervousness or difficulty in relaxing are taught a few relaxation methods to find their inner peace easier.
This helps the child to sleep more calmly.
If he starts talking in his sleep, we'll try to keep our rest.
Remember, this is harmless for the child, and the next day they'll remember nothing.
Useful Councils
Don't wake the child.
It wouldn't be worth it, because the kid's not conscious, but he'd get out of sleep.
Even though he talks, he actually sleeps and rests.
Remember, if there is more than one intense anxiety involved, it is advisable to turn to a specialist or to discover what causes a child to have a great degree of anxiety.
If you speak understandably (the less rare case), do not start asking to know anything from him.
It would be worthless, because when you sleep, you are not so conscious to gather your thoughts together.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you can't see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of the heard and the possible conclusions.
Don't ever tell the kid about his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
It's a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episode.
At last Illhaeusern straight
After a long deep flight, Illhaessen's team finally bought a new boost and gained a victory on the domestic course.
Although it wasn't a fertile game, the yellow and black people were in a position several times, using one of which they could finally win.
The rate of the match was not too tight, since the attackers were difficult to feel the right rhythm.
The first capura shot was tried by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the distant ball just touched the upper corner of the gate. Then Illhaeusern was in charge, and the shots followed each other: Fonderflick tried a long shot, and then Hirn's shooting went over the gate.
On the other side, the players defended in a block on the middle field, and only the ever-smoking Riahi got into a shooting position.
The beginning of the second half time was promised to be crucial: first Riahi and Temporale were positioned on the Dannemarie side. On the other hand, she was born with the first goal: After the first shot of Diebold, the ball was taken out by the excellent position of Illhaeusern Marais and then sent it to the gate (53 minutes).
However, Illhausern’s golden maker did not enjoy long glory: twelve minutes later, he had to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue their struggle in man - weakness.
However, Dannemarie was unable to take advantage of her advantage: they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who just moved a little further to strengthen their protection. The last seconds alone kept some excitement when the ball was very close to the gate.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before you fly to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy's gonna put an exit to Bretagne.
The demonstration held by the fishermen on Monday was paralyzed by several ports of Breton and Normann. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the Port of Finistère, Le Guilvinec, to meet the representatives of the protesters.
The latter promised that the President would be welcomed in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would come with "concrete proposals".
The presidential visit is just in line with the meeting of the 'Crises Committee' set up by breton fishermen to initiate action against the increase in gas oil prices, as the oil price exceeded the average record price of EUR 1.14 per litre.
David Martinon, speaker of the President of the Republic, said that "the President will talk to fishermen about how to help companies recover their competitiveness and make maritime seafarers more safe with working conditions and wage conditions".
Fishermen are determined to wait for Nicolas Sarkozy to arrive.
Tuesday morning, in the county of Morbihan and Calvados, traffic-friendly demonstrations were carried, with which almost 10 km long torsions were caused.
They also paralyzed the transport of Quiberon's yacht port, but the roads to Belle-île were not closed.
On the Quiberon peninsula, road towers have been placed.
On Monday, sailors have already witnessed their determination, and at the morning, tyres and pallets were burned in front of the fuel tanks of Bresti ports, while protests were held in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic Coast and La Manchester. In the Vendée county Sables d'Olonne, for example, fishermen did not board ships, while about 20 ships in Le Havre hindered the traffic of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turbale and Le Croisic, located in the county of Loire-Atlantique, have eliminated the huge total oil refinery block in Donges.
However, the fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held in the Ministry by decision on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the 'Crise Committee' has to decide on the next step and its participation at the meeting planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris on Tuesday.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the Heads of the National Fisheries Committee, as the Committee did not support their efforts.
"The strikes continue," said Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on gas oil are currently paying about 50 cents for their litres, but they believe that the operation of a ship would only become profitable if the price of gas oil falls below EUR 0,30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
The unforgettable title of "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" in Connecticut's home, at 83 years old, was killed by cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have also given their respect to the cinema legend and the profession of Paul Newman, who died when he was 83 years old.
Embraer does not change its 2008 transport plans
Despite the global economic crisis, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, Embraer, is able to maintain plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008 - confirmed by Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of the company.
In the first semester, the company shipped 97 planes.
The Brazilian producer company is largely accounted for the Chinese market, in particular for 30 to 120 passenger aircraft.
So far, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers over eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been re-established by American financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion that is earmarked for it, stated the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
In addition to life insurance and American pension activities at international level, the AIG would pay off a large part of almost all its other business - the newspaper quoted funds close to the case.
According to the Times, the Board of Directors of AIG held a meeting on Sunday evening to examine the sales opportunities.
The AIG has not confirmed this information.
The assets to be sold by AIG include the aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., the 59% share of Transatlantic Holdings in the reinsurance company, as well as the real estate portfolio and private capital investments.
However, according to the newspaper, there is still no final decision on sales.
AIG needs to have liquid assets quickly to repay a loan of 85 billion dollars approved to the US Government, thereby taking the risk that it should become 80% of its capital and lose its shareholders in the corresponding proportion.
Paris Historique's study on Morning Meeting of History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historically significant fall on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson's banking rescue plan. Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (which means almost 800 points) and Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) has fallen 777.68 points, thus closing at 10 365.45 points.
The largest fall in the index (684,81 points) so far was registered on 17 September 2001 when trade resumed after the 11 September terrorist attack.
Nasdaq 199,61, which is mainly based on technological papers, closed at 983,73 points, while the increased index of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points according to official closing data.
Wall Street's stock exchange was weakened at the time of opening, and then when the senate unexpectedly declined the banking rescue plan to restore market balance, it started a deep-fly flight.
The Members rejected the provision of resources requested by Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson by 228 'no' against 205 'yes'.
The plan was completed by nearly two thirds of the Republicans.
"The market has filtered bad signs because the Congress seems to be unable to approve a plan," says Lindsey Piegza, analyst of FTN Financial.
"That shows how much the market was looking for this plan," he added, and then expressed his concern about the fact that if a few days later, such a plan would be adopted, it would be "too late".
"If the plan is actually deceased to death (...), then the American Central Bank (American Central Bank) and the other Central Banks will be in order to deal with the crisis, and the conditions for lending will continue to be tightened" - warn Brian Bethune, head economist of Global Insight.
Piegza adds to the need for further enhancement, "all days a new and new financial institution is going to bankrupt" in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities ensured that the Washovia banking business was purchased by her, Citigroup.
The crisis in Europe suddenly accelerated, which called for emergency measures to save banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany, which indicates that "not only the American but the global crisis has emerged," adds the FTN Financial Analyst.
The bond market has been substantially viable.
The yield of the 10-year-old government bond fell from 3.827% on Friday night to 3.632% and the 30-year-old fell from 4.357% on the previous day to 4.161%.
Obama won the first television duel
On Friday, the two American presidential candidates followed another debate, which had to decide that John McCain or Barack Obama would be the winner of the duel.
Not surprisingly, both the authorities of the Republican and the Democratic campaign told themselves the victory in the television duel that was followed by one third of the American households.
According to David Gergen's political analyst, although John McCain's action was respectful, it was not enough to be "influential" to stop the decline in popularity: this is demonstrated by surveys carried out five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better in the fight: according to the results published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage (44% and 49%).
39% of the respondents ask for Obama to win, while 25% of them are counting on McCain's victory, according to the CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase its advantage by making Joseph Biden's promising great Thursday. He is preparing for his first and only public debate with Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned me this weekend: "It would be a shame to underestimate Palin.
He's got a good feeling."
McCain, in his 70s, never misses to set aside his own, unquestionably huge foreign policy experience; however, he emphasises his opponent's "naiveness" in these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"It seems Senator Obama doesn't understand..." said the attack several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for the presidential position," said McCain.
This is the main attack site that has been exploited by the Republican television ads that have been running since yesterday.
Obama, however, emphasised that he represents the future.
He didn't let you get embarrassed: he was gathered together and precisely formulated.
He stressed that he was able to make and restore the world’s image of the United States.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama has already done," he cut back this weekend's democratic ad that drew it to the eyes of the Republican leader that he still did not measure the impact of the crisis on the American "trade people".
"In the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," he said yesterday before 20 thousand people in Obama who were gathering together in a rainy rain in North Carolina for the electoral meeting.
He hasn't even been able to take the words of "mean" or "workers" out of his mouth. The confusion in the financial world is undoubtedly favoured by Obama, which the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy on the edge of the collapse.
"The next week can prove to be a turning point," he thought yesterday Charles Schumer, the powerful Democratic Senator.
Mr Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of Clinton's government, said Obama has such excellent instincts in the field of the economy as Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic Presidential candidate, the crisis is "the final judgment on the bad economic policy for eight years, created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain".
The Illinois Senator reaffirmed the ability to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans despite stock exchange fluctuations. It added that its primary objectives include creating the potential energy independence of the country through the use of renewable energy sources and the development of a health insurance system.
McCain, however, plans to set up 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates have carefully avoided issues relating to a banking rescue plan of EUR 700 billion (470 billion): the extremely unfamiliar plan was adopted last night by the Congress.
Minsk: "Have you noticed that there was a election here?"
Young and opponents protested on Sunday night at the capital of the capital of Belarus to reject the expected results of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after the closure of the voting venues, hundreds of Belarus gathered together at the headquarters of Minsk to protest against the falsification of election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, many youths protested against President Alexandr Lukasenko with the following words: "Diktator, drop down!"
Some admit that they haven't even gone to vote, "Why would I have gone?" says a young man.
Demonstrators do not believe that the regime, which has tried to make a good example in front of foreign observers, would be ready to change a democratic system for the purpose of linking with the European Union.
If the elections were to be clear, the observers would be able to dissolve the country-inflicted sanctions, in which 40 Belarusian leaders refused the visa and some bank accounts were frozen.
However, according to the opposition, the elections did not take place purely.
"We were kept away from the electoral committees, and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote counting," said Mr Potyemkin, who was the spokesman of the United Democratic Forces Coalition.
"The changes were only nominal," emphasises Aleksandr Milinkievich, the opponent of the 2006 presidential elections and the leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who will calculate the votes, and in our case this is the executive power.
If the delegations of the opposition enter the Parliament, that means they were appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament allows them to have a seat on television, meet in the regions of the country and submit proposals for legislation.
The opposition must therefore act in political life, because "the dialogue with the European Union must be launched".
Because if we are going into a crisis against Russia and we are not able to renew, we are at risk of being subject to Russia's authority.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the outcome of the vote will be adopted as valid by the European Security and Cooperation Organisation following the election process.
They stress that the participation rate appears to be too high and the broad organisation of the preliminary vote (26% of the electoral citizens in Minsk) allowed any manipulation.
"They have noticed that there was a election here?" asks the president of the Social Democrat of Aleksandr Kozulin, who was released in August this year as the last one in prison, where it was held as a political prisoner.
No one was abstained in the voting premises.
There will be no more than five opposition representatives in Parliament, which is who are most suitable for leadership.
The October space is again to be quiet at night.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Committee will be pleased.
The blood is safe again
President Dr. Francine Décary had a good reason for celebrating because today Hema-Quebec became one of the safest and most effective blood-proof companys in the world.
Most importantly, it has succeeded in recovering the confidence of people, which has seriously disrupted by the scandal of infectious blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As known, the country’s blood reserve managed by the Canadese Red Cross blood supply was infected with the acquired immune deficiency symptomatic (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and general oppression, the Government of Canada launched a formal investigation in February 1994 under the head of Judge Horace Krever, which was designed to reflect the circumstances that led to the tragedy and put forward proposals to avoid future similar cases.
While Judge Krever's delayed report was submitted, some of the provinces set up their own committees with a view to designing a new blood system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee carried out this task.
On the basis of the Gelineau and Krever reports, two blood supply services were established in Canada: one was the Hema-Quebec server of Quebec, the other was all the other provinces and the Canadian Blood Association responsible for the provision of the two Territories.
"When Hema-Quebec started his activity in 1998, fewer than 38% of people already had confidence in the blood supply system of Quebec," Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was desperate.
"But in the coming years, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field, we have succeeded in reinforcing the confidence of people." Décary states proudly that nearly 94% of the population in Quebec, in early 2008, considered it reliable for Hema-Québece.
Doctor Décary, however, does not forget that "this trust is a very fragile thing".
Since the establishment of Hema-Quebec on 28 September 1998, he has applied the principle of caution.
During this period, a number of cases have been revealed in Europe when people have been infected with a new variant of creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease - the doctor, who has been in charge of the company since the start of 1998.
"We had no idea whether this disease was spread by blood.
We therefore rely on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports, which is why, if we are unsure and the risk of developing a serious disease, we need to take exclusion measures. In this case, Creutzfeldt-Jakob was a disease that is causing brain lesions, which is inevitably leading to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who have spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And a few years ago, without doubt, it was found that the disease spreads through blood.
This case convinced us that it was pointless to apply the principle of caution."
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that allows the HIV virus to be more sensitive to diagnosis. This is the nucleic acid test (NAT), which is directly capable of showing the virus in the blood of the tax collectors and not of antibodies forming against the virus, on which the previously used tests were based.
The NAT test has enabled us to shorten the window period, which keeps us from infection until we can show the virus in the blood with our technical tools - explains the expert.
This period could be reduced for a shorter period than a week.
Thus, they significantly reduced the risk of infecting the blood supply and not showing it.
These developments have largely reduced the risk of proliferation of AIDS through transfusions.
Nowadays, the risk of someone getting blood infected with HIV virus is 12 million to one.
"However, this means that we should divide 12 million blood products until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Quebec divides 400 to 500 thousand blood products every year, it should be over 24 years to have a case like this and to be infected with HIV virus through a blood preparation.
I think that now anyone can accept or write blood transfusions to restore health, says the first leader of Hema-Quebec.
"The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We'll never know what new pathogen comes into the system.
It was only last year that the Chikuunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters into the blood by insects.
Therefore, we have to be all the time," continued Doctor Décary, and stressed that, apart from the emergency reserves, Hema-Quebec had to provide sufficient permanent reserves.
"The ageing of the population also increases the demands.
As cancer therapy has become more aggressive, patients often need replacement of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the population of blood taxes, as the number of people in the network who are able to deliver blood is only 3% of the population in Quebec.
However, every healthy person at least 18 years of age, who fulfils the conditions of qualification, may have blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of candidates do not accept blood because they have been infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have visited countries where malaria is destroyed are not entitled to blood for one year.
"That's the 3% reserve we have to meet the needs of the hospitals.
It's very rare that we're out of supplies.
However, we need to increase the number of blood leaks to the extent that the existing ones become old, because they can't give blood after a while.
However, it is very difficult to convince people to give blood, but it is even harder to keep them and make them become regular blood taxes.
In this rushing world today, man has barely had one hour to go to blood." Francine Décary regrets.
Hema-Quebec, a producer of the annual budget of 297 million, provides not only blood products but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, cardiovascular tissues, eyeball tissues and skin tissues, which are used almost exclusively for severely burned people.
These tissues are analysed, converted and frozen, then placed at Hema-Quebec, which treats the single public stock bank in Quebec.
It can only be obtained from a nail spray treated as medical waste with blood that is rich in stem cells, so it can also be treated with severe diseases (e.g. leukaemia).
"We celebrated a few weeks ago that our bank has entered the 1,000th Navel Bone Model, and we plan to take more than a thousand new samples a year.
At the beginning of next year, we are probably starting to offer these for organ transplants" - clarified Décary doctor, who believes that the navel leakage programme is nowadays very popular.
"A lot of moms are sad because they have no chance" - that's true, because Hema-Quebec is not in a position to make this complex and costly programme available in every hospital in Quebec.
Football kicking - in the front-end Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders on the USL-1 dialers yesterday at 3:1 and reached the predecessor with a total result of 4:3. This was the second quarter-decision match, which was crucial for the competitors in the Saputo stadium.
The final goal was acquired by Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half time passed without a goal, in the second, two midwayers of the Montreal team found David Testo and Rocco Plancentino in the bedroom of the opponent.
Roger Levesque from the Sounders team alone managed to play Matt Jordan's gate.
Remember, on Friday's first match, Impact 2:1 was defeated by Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the suburbs of Seattle.
Impact plays in the predecessor with Vancouver Whitecaps.
Saturday night, in Minnesota, the Thunder team, who got out of Whitecaps by 3:1 at the first game, won 4:3 in the predecessor, but yet the Whitecaps came into the predecessor with a total result of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the match details are yet to be specified today.
Dial - Kovalev's winner gole
Canadiens' favorite triangle is waiting for another season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostinsyn led three great attacks, and eventually the Canadiens won the Florida Panthers against 3:2 of the criminal assassinations last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, acquired a goal. Plekanec two and Kovalev closed the match with a goolpass, which was the fourth victory from the six preparatory games of the team.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who got the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not yet prepared," the Russian player warns.
"I need another game to make me feel really fit."
"You've been trying to get too much out of you in the first third," noted Guy Carbonnau.
"But I think the end of the game was happy.
He's got a huge ovation."
Charest's Northern Goals
The Head of Government does not rule that the election will begin this year
The meeting of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest, was traveling to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduz (links) breaks the victory at the interim election to be held today.
"According our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was set by Jean Chares at the meeting of the québeci Liberal Party in Lévis yesterday, which was also enriched with visual elements, while the president tried to concentrate on the matter.
During his performance, behind his back, they set pictures like "Moulin à images".
The three giants followed each other's impressive footages: water plants' dams, mining, Quebec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular instruments are used during election periods.
By the way, the Head of Government at the press conference refused to guarantee that the election will not begin this fall this year, although he added that his schedule was very close.
The fourth pillar of the "Nest Plan" is the "waters" for the future of Prime Minister Quebec, which is included in a "new economic area", which includes a Labour Convention with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and a number of conventions designed by Ontario.
The opening of the North (i.e. the northern area of the 49th latitude) has often been included in the speeches of the Head of Government, but has never held a lecture on this subject.
However, the Head of State was simply aimed at explaining why he considers North as a "great treasure mine with huge opportunities", but he did not talk about the time factor, investment sums, or specific priorities for future projects.
It only highlighted some development opportunities: mainly water plants, forestry, and in particular mining, which is further underpinned by the growth of the countries in the corridor and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
"Nines, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds" listed Chares in the north.
This area, which is "two times the size of France", is our territory, the territory of Quebec.
It is not just in us, but in us," reiterated the Head of State, emphasising that this will create a national founder's myth.
He pointed out that Quebec's development was largely defined in the relationship with the North: the gold haze in Abitinib, the québec design work, the James Bay...
"This is our future!", he added it after having taken a stage break, he saw the giant map behind his back.
The 70% north of Quebec also includes a part of Labrador, which Québec has always demanded to himself – the head of the governor told the press conference.
"This is our historic resolution, confirmed by all governments.
There is a line for which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if there is an occasion, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the Government."
On the other hand, "in the light of climate change, we must reconsider our view on the North" said the Head of Government, speaking of the northwest gateway, which opens every year as a result of the melting of the Arctic ice.
In this new geopolitical environment, the Head of Government believes it is an important task to take this area into account.
And what about the indigenous people, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Head of Government said that the Government of Quebec would pay particular attention to them, and that the plan would benefit many, especially young people.
The two ministers of the various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau, who were formerly convened by the Party Québécois Hungarians, have already started the consultation with some thirty local communities.
It has also been launched by the Interministerial Committee of Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role.
The Head of Government does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, not necessarily a summit, where they create a common vision.
The development of the North would otherwise be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly," said the Head of Government.
Jean Chares described this 'visio' as in line with the ideas of the Liberal Prime Ministers before him.
"Only as the former liberals, we are thinking differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from challenges."
This was, by the way, one of the recurring topics of the weekend that started the 50th anniversary of the election of the Jean Lesage parade on Friday with the celebrated great cocktail party.
One of the decisions adopted proposes that the power plant Beauharnois be baptized as a barrier to Adélard-Godbout.
"Our politicians, including Godbout, founding Hydro-Québecet, the Lesage of the quiet revolution and the proliferation of water plants, or, as the father of James Bay, all of them knew how to grind the future," said Jean Chares.
At the press conference, he quoted another - true - conservative - work, namely John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister Roads to the North from 1957 to 1963.
In relation to the plan for Eastmain1a-Ruper's dam, President Charest pointed out that the installation will be planned for 2012.
"This should be between us, but I'm planning to be there," he told his people, and his statement was accepted by a loud applause.
The Prime Minister, who, in April, said that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote this year in the autumn which the law will allow him to vote.
However, he stressed that his calendar is already full, as he has taken tasks at the meeting of the Federal Council in China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The Conference of the Liberal President at the end of the week has proved to be an excellent platform for drawing up nationalist decisions, which have been approved almost without thinking. This is mainly about "work-related ambitions": the liberal Party, in particular, demands the recognition of "Quebec's specific nature" in the Constitution.
I also want Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunication Council and these members to have the right to veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the other hand, the opposition was skeptical about the main points of the North Plan.
Paulina Marois, head of the Coast Québecois, re-introduced the North-Quabetic development policy, which was introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that was powered in 2003 rejected the application of this policy.
If they hadn't done, "we'd like to go much ahead today," Mrs Marois thought in agreement with Mrs Françoise Mercure, who was launched by the Jean-Talon vote today.
ADQ supports the opposition party that the government accepts the North Plan.
"But we would like this not to be a pure act," noted the president of the Sébastien Proulx who replaced Mario Dumont, who came back from his freedom today.
Letters - A Greeded Country
Vic Toews, Minister of the Harper Cabinet (including Minister of Justice) last summer took the courage to call Louise Arbourt Canada "shameous".
So to disgrace a woman who fought for justice without delay and deserves all our admirations - that tells a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government, which, one of the Western countries concerned, has not transported its own national from the concentration camp in Guantánamo.
This is the government that absolutely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager during the crimes he committed.
This is the only government that, despite the signing of the Geneva Convention, Canada has refused his word and lets a child soldier suffer under inhuman conditions.
The only government that makes a puppet theatre of justice while investigating the guiltyness of a defendant.
Let us remember that the association of UNICEF, Amnesty International and Canadian lawyers also demands the return of Omar Khadr to receive a fair procedure in Canada.
And our government is blinding the tour: it doesn't matter to him that a young adult has been mentally completely ruined, and many years of torture has probably spoiled his fate for life.
Although we are not aware of this yet, but at the moment our rights, freedom and democracy are undermining. "Democracy": Harper calls this word, which is just a empty voice from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morals: they can be brutally beaten, tortured and imprisoned by any Canadian citizen, according to the pity of a government leader who was in a minority until now (and what could come after October 14th?).
Many constituents believe that salvation can be found by a party that glorifies the virtue, the Law and the Order. They do not see that this government scorns the values of which the good news and dignity of our country owed.
Dear Mr. Toews, the shame is this - don't look anywhere else.
Opinion - Barrick Gold Orwell vocabulary
A letter was published in Le Devoir's September 17th from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy President General of the Canadese Barrick Gold Mine.
As a result of Orwell's deliberation, Garver states that the world's largest golden producer company has launched a six-million-dollar disproportionate suspicion against three authors and a small-payer publishing company in order to initiate a so-called 'open debate'.
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decisions are taken, especially in the relentless proceedings, not by the truth, but by the law.
It's not surprising that Garver listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
Would it really be the best way for Barrick Gold to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to that of the public debate?
Regardless of the outcome of the proceedings, authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend significant amounts to protect and fight in an inequal battle where the army of lawyers supported by almost inexpensive resources from the mining industry on the other side.
In such an unequal struggle, the tactic is often used to destroy the defendant and to conclude a friendly agreement that does not only silence the opposite, but even fears those who would try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views before the public.
Although in a number of other countries where Barrick Gold is active, this happens differently, in Canada, the disputers usually don't strike each other, they say their thoughts.
It would therefore have been enough for the mine to open its books and files and prepare for a real debate in a press, media, publications, paying for independent research groups that could have been able to reflect on the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold doesn't trust the public's opinion, and with a move, he's misleading the applications and letters written to protect the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how to initiate a 'open' debate if he ignores the opinion of this public at the same time?
In the head of the Vice-President, this word is probably just about lawyers paid on the bus, not the overall residence of Canada: the meaning of the concept is so narrow.
In a democratic state, freedom of speech is a matter for others.
Barrick Gold, however, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are primarily supported by the public because it condemns the harsh practice of the mine.
The public opinion is willing to listen to Barrick and the judgement, but this would be done by civilised arguments rather than by a case of silence for many. (In the context of the 'open debate', Barrick Gold recently called on the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to Garver's surreal minds, Barrick Gold's process is an open offensive against the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which is the builders of all democratic society.
In its entirety, he denies the right to quote credible resources, to debate the facts and interpretation of them, which form the basis for spiritual activities.
If a country like Canada can only be studied and discussed with the burden of suspicion of issues that do not like the rich companies of the world today, then who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants a open and transparent debate, this could be done according to the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to answer.
In our university circle, we have been able to deal with disputes, differences and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold's unthinked procedure shows well that, contrary to its claim, it is not in the mood to have an open debate.
This is a loss for both the universities' world and the Canadian public debate institution, and it is time for governments to finally introduce measures that restrict legal procedures for such abuse.
Wall Street Emergency Action - The Democrats and Republicans agreed
The Heads of the Bush Government and of the Congress Republican and Democratic Republic of yesterday finally reached an agreement on the economic rescue operation, which has been the greatest standard since the major economic crisis in the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan, designed to tackle the financial crisis on Wall Street for months, still needs to approve the two houses of the Congress.
The main points of the plan are: better control of implementation by representatives; new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the foreseen public funds; new provisions to maintain the number of houses held for lack of payments; access to the payment of the managers of the companies receiving assistance.
Henry Paulson, American Minister of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the United States House and Judd Gregg, a representative of the Republican in the trial yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, the good news was announced after the two-day marathon trial was completed.
"We have made a major progress towards a solution that will work effectively on the markets," said Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush government.
"We have done everything to save the real economy and the American citizens from the current crisis on Wall Street," explained the Democratic representative.
"The most important aspect is that if we do not do this, the shock, chaos and confusion will be enormous in the lives of the Americans every day," said Judd Gregg Republican.
The trial was accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have a negative impact on the mood of investors.
To the agreement, the stock exchange was given a deadline until the opening of this morning.
The two presidential candidates later joined the negotiations appeared to be willing to agree, but they expressed no doubt that the situation has increased to the end.
Senator Barack Obama's Democratic Authority has given itself the extension of the agreement with elements such as the provisions on the preservation of household property or the payment of managers of companies assisted by the State.
"When we ask the taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of the irresponsibility of other people, that is not a very pleasant thing.
"These steps are necessary," he noted in an American television show.
And when the opponent, John McCaint, asked another channel about whether he would vote for the proposed plan, he said, "I would love to know the details, but I hope so."
"What I read in large lines, it is already visible that it is something that we all need to digest, and that we can move on.
The possibility of not doing anything is simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the 700 billion plan, taxpayers would buy the doubtful demands of US financial institutions, some risk-free assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis which was triggered by the extinction of the Real Estate Fund, which led first to a collapse of risky real estate loans (second mortgages) and then to other debt securities (trading) and ultimately to the freezing of liquid resources and the revolving of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was failed last week by a group of Republican representatives.
It seems that we have been able to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed that certain "toxic" instruments of firms in difficulty should rather be secured by the government rather than buying it.
In order to ensure that all members of the Congress are satisfied, there is also a provision in the plan which requires that if the government has to bear losses for five years in the framework of the programme, it may impose new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, an amount of EUR 250 billion would be paid for the first time; this could be followed by another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The remaining $ 350 billion should be approved by the Congress with a new vote.
In exchange for the aid, Washington acquires a share in the supported companies, which provides a share of profits and can be sold after the crisis has occurred.
The federal government will be able to delay the booking of real estate to cover the mortgages covered by the plan, and it may also set the maximum amount of salary and final compensation to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The developers of the plan would like the plan to be voted by the House today and the Senate on Wednesday.
However, despite their efforts, it is still not certain that the plan is being approved.
Because, yesterday, there have been repeated statements against the plan among both Republicans and Democrats.
"It's perfectly clear that Washington won't hear your voice," said Scott Garrett, the Republican, who is a member of the financial committee of the house, to his electorate.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
"But there's nothing that would favour taxpayers."
Brad Sherman, a representative of the Democratic Group leading a small Congress group called "Sceptical Group", presents things differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic experts, including three Nobel Prize scientists, wrote to us to ask the Congress: Don't hurry, and examine carefully which path she will take" said Sherman yesterday.
At the same moment in Europe, it was realized that this is a global crisis.
Following a crisis discussion, the three Benelux States announced that a part of the Fortis Banking Group would be publicised by EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion USD).
The intervention of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments has become necessary after the French BNP Parisas announced, not buying a competitor on the side of the bankruptcy after losing EUR 2 million (2.9 billion USD) as a result of the US crisis in secondary mortgage loans.
With the 85 000 employees of Fortis, one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurance companies.
"This isn't thrown money" said yesterday Mr. Wouter Bos, Dutch finance minister.
"In exchange, we get voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation is unsure."
In the meantime, on the other side of La Manchester, the British government seems to be planning to republicate another bank, which has been overcome by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over the total current loans of the Bradford and Bringley Bank, from which real estate loans amount to 41 billion pounds (75.5 billion USD).
The Spanish Santander bank announced yesterday that they would purchase the British bank's subsidiaries and customer stocks.
The Bradford and Bringley after this Northern Rock would be the second bank that the British government wanted to resign since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Greetings from the actor server
Some of the beautiful eyes of the auras, say, were the main hit cards, some say it was the greatest weakness.
Have you ever got rid of the narcissic mirror by the mud smiled American actor?
Yeah, and I don't.
With his shame, sensitivity, and inclined talent, he was also distant with the grey style that is the life of the great monuments of the art world.
But what a gigantic course he came in!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer on Friday at the holding of Connecticut, one of the last icons of the American cinema's flower age.
There was less monumental personality than Brando, who was considered a long-term competitor in the movies. He was more retired and certainly vulnerable, but he also declared freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood often produces extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio, a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic shapes of the American dream.
He didn't think much about himself, which just strengthened his earnings.
It was a fanland for the idea of a self-made man and the idea of a warrior in the Pacific war. In the early 1950 ’ s, he studied at Yale University’s drama and then at the Actor's School in New York before he broke into the theater, television and a short time later in the cinema.
In addition to being a leader of civil rights, in 1979 as a car competitor, he was second place in my 24-hour voyage in Le Mans. In addition, he was considered a sex symposium, although he was married to Joanne Woodward in a happy marriage since 1958.
Now we can never find out what the shadows of this mysterious, closed actor's life for his work, who hated the shining of the show-business, which is a mystery for ever.
He was an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked the movie fans: in his big roles, we can only see it on the black screen of the memories.
Looking at his lifework, we've been looking through the seventh American art, the movie has been constantly changing over 50 years ago.
In our memory, the young man of "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" is a charming cowboy (1969) and his emotional wife (Elizabeth Taylor), who was in the work of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
From recent times (1990) in the face of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, we can remember who faces the age of his marriage that has not changed his hopes.
Paul Newman also saw many other faces in his movies.
In his film Robert Wise "The One Upstairs", Rocky Graziano was an unforgettable actor with a stormy life in the role of a criminal, Rocky Graziano, who started Newman's career in 1956, which was originally intended for James Dean, and which was taken after his death.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant work "The Great Trouble" that won Oscar for the best movie in 1973.
Robert Rossen's genius film "The svindler" (1961) made a bitter, revengeful billiard player and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's "White of Money" film.
Various times, but always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like this.
The time of his wreckage was marked by a change of ages.
Younger people are mainly familiar with the culture film George Roy Hill '1977', where Reggie Dunlop, a hockey team, is not a traditional coach.
The lovers of the "Great jump" recorded by the Coen Brothers were seen in 1994.
Sam Mendes' film "The Way of Disastrous" closed in 2003: this was the last thing he saw in the role of an Irish Mafia Chief.
Unlike many cinemas who left the movies relatively soon, Newman stayed in light for a long time, although he convicted Hollywood with shining, shining and imagination.
Bertrand Tavernier, French film regulator, did not consider it to be a "lifer of underplay" without any humor: he thought his game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always gracious with the handsome Paul Newman, whose long time the film roles fell into his lap.
Yet, young and successful characters played rarely: rather, he formed malicious, malicious, or hopeless figures in the face of society, whose prosperity and rebellion could be returned with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a less known face: deep in his soul, he was a very cautious and sensitive man.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" with his wife, Joanne Woodward, a fine portrait of a melancholic woman.
He reminds his son, Scott, who died of drug overdose, with a film of retardation and sadness, "Harry and Son" in 1984.
Last night, Newman's honorer remembered the actor. A close friend and old warrior Robert Redford (who played together in "The Great Trouble" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") said: "It made my life and the world better.
The joy of generosity and existence: this was the secret of this great actor's vibrating personality that we have now lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his remarks of civil rights, the environment, the struggle for independent film production and the criticism of Hollywood's outbreaks are diminished.
We often saw his image smile on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He did it with a pretty bad mouth, although at the beginning he thought it was funny.
However, the revenue from such sales was always transferred to the foundation for children with disease.
Newman never sat on his brass: He's been committed to his profession all the time.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following sentences: "You fathers were always undeniablely grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here."
It is also a privilege for us to go through the career of such a glorious and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, all over it.
What did they produce at Zuschlag & Tsai's account factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
Politicians and associates are charged with fraud and other crimes, including falsification, which are particularly serious injuries in the criminal organization.
According to the Public Prosecutor, the successful tender funds were used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often confirmed by unauthorised accounts.
Public and municipal funds – in total, about 65 million forints – partly wandered into the casino of the Young Left, partly into the pockets of some people.
The method described by the investigating authority was that the received tender funds were taken on the basis of cost accounts that were not actually compensated, and the associations never fulfilled the undertaking.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were fake.
To this end, the bills were collected on the yoohefváros market, and the circulars were manufactured in Kiskunhala.
And for the names of the companies that were to be accounted for, among other things, it was decided on the Balaton highway to which János Zuschlag sent Lados István.
According to her recent statement, she had to look like bedrooms and restaurants.
He asked for an account of his consumption, for which the accounts to be submitted for applications from the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the social and employment wall and the Central Government were then prepared.
Most of these were recorded by Lados István with his partner, Kõri András, who, according to our information, wrote most of the reports that were necessary to obtain the aid.
One of his Lados's "study trip" eyes was a beer house.
According to the two bills issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, the host site provided a meal for a group of 90 members of the Commissioner Pont Association.
However, so much, according to the company manager, they would not have been able to enter the host location at the same time.
Similarly, for the right future - later together, the Third Year - Foundation was made of formal and content errors in the summer of 2002.
For there were only three rooms, more than ten people couldn't sleep in it one night, but the account was about 100 thirty guests.
But the fantasy form charging was overreacted even when Pigal Kft. was also marked for hospitality, which, according to the information given to the prosecution authority, was not included in the documents on the name of the Right Future and Hoppá.
The company's leader, Wolf Győr, told Hvg.hu that when he was called into the D.A. and billed, he immediately knew it was fake documents.
"The stamp was wrong with the name and tax number of our company."
He added: For more formal reasons, the fact that a hundred people were hired according to the account is not correct, because they have a total of 11 rooms with no such room.
In addition, the account was also called for the dining, while their restaurant hasn't been working for a long time.
The ijvering account manufacturers did not investigate the fact that the travel agency in Budapest, who looked like them, was only organising foreign travels, thus booking travel to Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which was also not consistent with the company’s account issuance practice.
Furthermore, as the investigation revealed, the document included the VAT, while travel activities to countries outside the European Union were free of VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was mistaken in the four documents issued by Hotel Revéfuröp Kft. for the right future, because the company’s service is not covered by the designated 25 but 15 percent VAT, and the staff of the hotel only issued a machine account, but the invoice produced was handy.
In addition, the "executors" have also been deteriorated by the fact that, for a company, road freight was designated as an activity carried out by the prosecution procedure, which was not carried out by a company based on investment advice.
In addition, formal deviations - inappropriate account format, not real stamping - have also failed that the accounts for the Third Years Foundation, the 21st century Cultural Association and the Commissioner Point are fake together.
As for Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Camp in Koweto, whose representatives refused to issue the bills.
For example, for example, the counterfeiters did not notice that HIB Kft. had been eradicated at the time the Group of the Young City was eating there, and that is why the company’s liquidator, as we know, denied that he had set up the paper.
I was informed.
The other group of issuers is those who were aware that they have to issue a fictional account.
At the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, the Esely Foundation for Budapest issued a bill for the Third Year’s Foundation, for about four million forints.
The head of Collab Ltd., according to the prosecution, has been charged by one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, to issue the fictional account.
He also cooperated with the Zuschlags with the Biogate Kft., which, in 2003, the Better Future Foundation, the Association of Atlas and the Red Furnish Association issued a roughly five million HUF account which was not a real economic activity.
No money movements, because the invoices completed were executed after it, but this was forgotten by the organizations in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the invoice belongs to the defendants.
Thus, he was responsible for the delivery of Kubatov Iván to the Ukrainian Executive Director of Delta Trió Kft.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several accounts for the sale of computer equipment, at some 18 million HUF.
According to the data of the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Cash Investment Kft., Cash, which has been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
This company was run by a Romanian man who would also have forwarded the company's related documents between 2002 and 2005.
We understand that Kubatov acknowledged in the investigation that on behalf of Kft, he issued an account to Atlas, Hoppa and the Third Year of the Foundation, and he took their counterpart.
At the request of Kubatov Iván, Romanian miners were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipula Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies actually worked, which, according to the defendant, were the reason why they didn't get a job.
However, they benefited from the fact that Saint Zsolt, a lawyer who made the documents of the defended company foundations, issued accounts on behalf of the companies to Zuschlag associations: Atlas and Y-Generation.
On behalf of the Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 bills, worth 14,2 million HUF.
The D.A. considered that 10 percent of the sums on the accounts and the VAT hit Kubatov mark.
The man even used Si-Beri Bt. for fictional bills, they were produced for the commission of the Commissioner Point.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Alliance submitted a tender for Modern Hungary to the Socialist Party's public benefit organisation, the Dancs Mikhály Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500 to 500 thousand forints, but the amounts were not used for the purposes set out in the tender.
In order to avoid this, the Works Team has received five fiction accounts to TMA.
These accounts were found in the search of the house in the office of Árpád Chemecse at his educational wallet.
Some of the defendants in the trial, as they did at the D.A., will probably report on the course of the account production.
Most interesting may be if you are the first defendant, János Zuschlag, decides that you're going to distract everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed, and although he has promised that he would speak about everything more extensively, he has not done that yet.
The question is whether the socialists have made a deal with it, while the large part of the damage, 50 million forints in return, and Zusi takes the fall.
Who could have been insulted today, for his requests to relieve the circumstances of his arrest, i.e. to put him in custody, were constantly found in deaf ears.
While offenders of far more damage and non-compensatory economic offences can walk freely or at least await the end of the proceedings against them at their own home, he is not able to do so.
Psychology of overliciting: why are we giving more money?
On auctions, customers tend to publish more money, overasses the goods.
The neurological-economic foundations of this known and apparently irrational behaviour have been explored to researchers of neurologic and economists at the University of New York.
According to a study published in Science, people do not want to miss a race like the auction of eBay, so they pay too much.
The research attempted to map this "play" neurosystem with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was Lottered, and the other group was involved in the player auction, while the active brain areas of experimental subjects were examined using the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method.
In both games, the participants may have earned money, but during the auction game - where the essential element of overliciting the other party - the complex underneath the brain cord has been active at the time the game was lost.
This brain area also plays a role in the "comprehensive" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, researchers believe that the uptake of the price can be explained by avoiding the intense reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the members of the research group of economists also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this three groups licitated against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed about the real value of the product and they did their bets.
In addition, another group has been promised that if they win out of the game, they'll get $15 more money.
The third group, however, received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group lost this money in the event of a loss of auction.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only that one of them was emphasised on the loss for one.
However, in demonstrating the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team playing "for loss" were willing to be higher than the controls and the "growth" groups.
"These results can not be derived from any theory of a former economy.
Until then, they only explained the phenomena of auction by the joy of victory and the risk avoidance.
Only neurological imagination methods helped to solve the conflict between these two theories by now reaching a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economic Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we contact a doctor?
Some half a billion people in the world are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, the leading causes of death are referred to chronic liver disease.
Hundreds of people with domestic hepatitis can be treated, but only seven thousand, which is why they don't know that they're infected.
The hepatitis name is a collector name of infected liver injuries caused by various viruses.
They have a lot of similarities, liver inflammation and yellowishness, but their pathogens and causing diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the feed channel (e.g. infected with food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (such as vaginal fluids, swallowing).
Passengers are certainly worth protecting against the A and B virus, and there is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis occur two to three weeks after eating infected food, generally unwell, weakness, abdominal pain, nausea.
Then the yellowness on the skin and eye whites, the faeces are clear, the urine becomes dark, healing can take two or three weeks.
A million people worldwide die in the more severe type of disease, liver cancer caused by hepatitis B and liver cortex.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth infected is given medications.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to liver swollenness and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not know about the disease because the pathogen is killing the liver cells underneath, and in many cases the first symptoms will occur only in 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention and regular screening tests are very important.
In three groups, there is much more of this disease than average: people who had transplanted blood, drug users and tattoos before 1991.
The number of infected chronic hepatitis C viruses in the world is currently available to 200 million.
As the disease can be demonstrated by a routine laboratory test, contact your home doctor if you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
By recognising the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, so the infectivity will be eliminated and cancer can be prevented.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, which was first organised in 2004 by patient-representing organisations worldwide.
It aims to draw attention to chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, the causes of development and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Whoever believes in God hurts less?
According to a recent study, religious faith works as a kind of painkiller, which could have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Researchers at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, studied the way Godly faith affects people’s pain sensitivity, published by the British Telegraph.
In the context of a rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were given in electrosics, while all studied a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out most of the pain.
As a result of the technique that shrinks the human brain, it turns out that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that was responsible for controlling the pain.
The first study is a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians, along with academics, participate from different parts of the university.
The test was done quite precisely by strengthening a sparkling device to the left hand of the experimental subject, which provided the electroscok.
Researchers asked the students to look at two paintings, the painting of the Virgin Mary and Leonardo da Vinci, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century.
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would create a religious state among the believers, while da Vinci’s image was chosen because it was not too different from the other and thought it was tranquilizing.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in a MRI scanner, during this time they received 20 electroscopes in four consecutive parts, either watching the religious theme or the general image.
The Catholics reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt "security" as "safe" and "safe, peace filled them".
While looking at the image of religion, 12 percent less pain was reported than when they saw Leonardo’s work before you.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who participated in the study itself, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, also with the atheists, only the correct photo should be found.
"We should find a picture of someone who is very positive about a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The exercise of faith should, and in many cases, change our personality," added Wright.
After the great results, the question is that if Leonardo or a similar caliber painter show the image of a madonna to believers, what would have an effect on their pain control?
Would the sight of the quality Virgin Mary give us even better results?
You're what you're sharing about yourself
On the 17th birthday, you can tell Google: you can be found in people's pockets at least as much as above your heads in the sky; you know where you are vacationed, what professional orders they go and what they care about.
And this is still not enough for Eric Schmidt, according to one of the company's main guys.
However, as far as orwell's horrors are concerned, they don't see exactly the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to collect more personal data about their users, and this is necessary to keep themselves in line with the original goal of Google founders, which said: "Let's put all the information on the world into the system!".
According to the said Google leader, after 10 years of world-wide work, the company is only beginning to be able to handle all information.
On the question of what will happen in five years, Schmidt answered: If Google could answer questions like "What do I do tomorrow?" or "What kind of work would I really do?" - but until then, software can't answer such simple questions because they can't get enough about the users.
Not all internet users are aware that online searches are accurately recorded with search keywords from which IP address they were searched and after searching the page of the interested persons left.
The two years ago started Personalized Search, for example, enable users to store their own surfing background history, to look back what they were looking for, what they clicked on, and, in the long term, they will generate better personalised hits for them - the same logic will be based on Recommendedations, with which the system offers us products and services based on our previous and fixed preferences.
What if they use my data against me if you look at what I am doing? - ask users who are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, the degree of potential power represented by the company can be scary, not guilt, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, but the oppression against power in the Internets.
However, it is confirmed that all phrases sought are not only recorded, but may, where appropriate, be passed to a third party, in such legal cases, the personality rights of Internet players are not protected by anything.
The most loud example of this was perhaps the coordinated action against the Brazilian pedophiles in which Google provided information on pedophiles from the Community site Orkut, which it reserved, to the Brazilian Government.
In May, however, those who are concerned about the rights of the personal data could even wish to get up when the company successfully proves its right in the court against the FBI, with the help of the EFF's electronic defence organisation: Google can not be forced to provide any information that the FBI in secret requested.
(In addition, the federal government successfully fought about 50 thousand web addresses and thousands of search phrases received by reference to the year-on-year law on child protection, but nevertheless failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and a complete website and keyword list for two months.)
Therefore, Google's judgment is quite controversial: those who keep their personal data from giving them feel intimism and their privacy are deteriorating by starting to use Google's services and acting against multi-companies in conservative imids.
In the meantime, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic computer fans, activists, users compiled in many countries see the next generation of big companies, the "fast corporation" in them, contrary to their rivals, has written with Microsoft as a world conqueror for Windows, as much as he can fight for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google does not, in other ways, request a user-identification code, asks no money for its applications, the open, free, continuously updated source code and program package will be much more accessible, younger, cooler than official software practice.
However, it may also happen because the geek accurately sees the very problematic relationship between personality rights and the Internet, which has been one of the most common keywords in recent years, the web 2.0 attracted itself.
The web 2.0 is nothing but collaboration, deliberately leaving traces and exploiting the available communication channels, and while they vary individually, the same thing is: we show ourselves.
A typical young community site may also lead to profiles from Facebook to Xang, they can also be linked to other services such as Twitter, or with a last.fm listing your music habits, and then all of them can be linked to follow-up systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, also lead to a blog that automatically displays their latest photos that are stored on Flickr or Picasa.
While you can read a number of examples of cases that reveal: a girlfriend easily finds out the morning photos of a common circle of friends that she spent the evening with her cheating friend or could fire a company's worker only because she writes her honest opinion about the top management in her blog: a sure concept of privacy has been fully reassessed now.
Those who live online are the ones that show themselves, so we can set the foundation behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And who wants to hide something or at least try to avoid the Google monopoly can do it (e.g., starting with the Google search system but not deliberately leaving Scroogle).
For example, the number of people who do not sign up on social sites so that they can't be read, Google's online applications can be replaced from the text editor to the image manager and news readers with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and that do not create the best profile we have ever had.
The public's not looking forward to the secret when Google shows the whites of the teeth.
The current value of the company is higher than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and the services introduced at an ever-evolving pace cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft but also to a number of other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, also find the unpleasant objections: the top management, for example, completely rejected the protest of employees, following the double payment of the company's kindergarten fee, the company's company's company's costly found the daily appetites of employees, but it is all broken down with the fact that Google has been pushing up before the Chinese government in 2006 and, in accordance with their agreement, the company's findings were too expensive to damage the good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules means that no new service will be announced in advance, only when it can be used, but, for sure, the problems of the coming months and years can move the world to another point: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archivization project will have sizes that the company will soon have to deal with the United States Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, because in this case we can build a full health profile with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database can also provide a good basis for the next generation of science-fi writers, the popular Cory Doctorow novella, Scroogled point orwell voices, describes the future in which only a person can be alarmedly approached from Google's data.
Two youths helped the eld dual killers in the negotiation
Two youths were interviewed by the police in the case of the occupied double murders, the reasoned suspicion was that they assisted in decoying the traces of the crime," said the spokesman of the Borsod County Police Headquarters on Tuesday.
Young people have acknowledged the act of their burden and are currently charged with criminal misdemeanor.
The two youths, according to MTI information, are defended on parole.
Penalties can also be punished by imprisonment for up to five years.
The suspect of the ancient double murder - a 23-year-old local man - was arrested on Sunday.
He's premeditated, prosperously suspected of the crime of multiple murders.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old man owed a 53-year-old man a higher amount.
The suspect didn't want to compensate for his debt, so on Wednesday, last week, he threw his creditor into an old-fashioned establishment where he killed him, and then with his 9-year-old girl.
According to MTI information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, a sign of which is that he committed the murder with a gun trapped at the scene.
The police are investigating the weapons and the circumstances of its use with expert involvement.
The stock exchange in Warsaw offered to buy the stock exchange in Prague
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech kroons - were offered by the Warsaw stock exchange for the purchase of a 100-percent share package of the Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish authorities despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded from any new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
That's why the stock exchange in Warsaw is in public hands.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which intends to sell over 60 percent of the papers over a few months.
The new Czech economic newspaper of E15 knows that the Polish offer represents the highest amount offered by interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech newspapers, the Wiener Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Exchange have offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Spanish stock exchange last week, said that the Warsaw stock exchange of interested parties would be the worst new owner, and it did not exclude that this would lead to the loss of the Prague stock in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated at 5-10 billion kroons by market experts.
According to the agreement of the shareholders, approximately 90% of the papers could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with approximately 25 % share, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. by 13.5 %.
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European pages
The European newspapers leading to their comments on the growing international financial crisis have already been referred to as "the 11th September".
The global financial disaster is attributed to the American President - accused by the Roman President La Repubblica - was not even able to set up his own party behind the bill of the law that was drawn up in his wound, which aims to cure the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by a billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to discuss the second September on 11 September.
A part of the Madrid press sees the crime strike in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there led the world economy to the edge of the collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the US financial system is growing, and then the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, however, following the Congress vote, the threat is that Washington is not offering a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the biggest transformations in the history of capitalism occurs.
The threat can no longer be ignored by the Genf Tags-Anzeiger.
Some states today may still provide rescue belts for supportive financial institutions and save them from bankruptcy with the money of taxpayers.
However, if even more banks collapse like domino stakes, neither the funds nor any further implication will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to go beyond their national selfishness and to centralise control over the fragmented financial markets.
Only on Monday, more than EUR 100 billion were received by illicit financial institutions - reminding the Vienna Der Standard that the concerns that, like the Americans, European taxpayers have to take their pockets deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis are increasingly realistic.
The EU has not dealt with the crisis that swept as a cunami throughout the old continent.
The "suppliers" do not have to be able to spend almost a hundred billion euros, but it would be nice to record: in which case it is reasonable to reach the money of taxpayers to prevent greater damage.
The Dongo flight is imitated by the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop technologies that can be avoided if not copying barrier sensors in the world of nature?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, the donor bees gave the strategic starting point to Nissan's engineers to build the next generation of preventing impacts.
In cooperation with the University of Tokio, Nissan built the BR23C bio-nautical auto Robot Management System, a robotised minivan that was supplied with the characteristics of the bees, with the ultimate aim of helping to develop a system that eliminates all impacts.
During the flight, each bee develops its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety guard - explained at the exhibition Kazuchiro Doi, technological PR and R & D brand manager.
Its role is important for the complex eyes of the bee, which can be seen in all directions in an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of a complex eye, engineers touched the idea of laser telemetry.
This identifies the obstacles within a two-metre distance within 180 degrees field before BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an operation to prevent impact.
During the breakpoint of the second, the barrier will be detected and then the car robe, following the movements of the bee, will immediately change the direction by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid impact.
In any other way than the current system, this avoiding maneuver is completely instinctive.
"If this wasn't the case, the car robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Auto Robot project.
It must respond in an instinctive way and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the safety guards, a layer within which the impact is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must be run within a perspective.
However, in a different way than the bees, the derogation cannot be directed upwards, downwards or transiently, only in two dimensions and only towards the turningability of wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite opportunity available for other bees to get out of the bees, only the rotation and the slowdown of the car robot were used as an option.
BR23C uses lithium polymer accumulators which are easier and higher energy density, which means that they have a longer life span than the lithium-ion version.
Andoh believes that the instinctive intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process data, even less storage.
This device has to process and react only a few incoming signs per second.
It is not necessary to maintain them and respond with intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers data, so only a few dozen kilometres of memory are constantly used.
There's no need for gigabytes or horny memory.
This is the first step to develop the technology for immediate circumvention, which, according to the estimates of Nissan, can be involved in cars manufactured in a series within 10 years.
An additional applicability may be to combine the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system so that it can lead the car to the specified end point by avoiding obstacles on the road.
It's called the poisoned child.
The written version has been completed for an economic rescue package of EUR 700 billion for buying bank bad loans in several detail.
First round, they spend half the amount.
According to the Eastern Coast time, during the further talks until midnight, Congress leaders reached the line of a total rescue package of 700 billion dollars in the debate that has been going on for days - reported by Reuters.
We have made a serious step forward - said Nancy Pelosi, President of the Democratic House of the United States, who believes that only the agreement will be put on paper.
The compromise of the package was supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance, Henry Paulson, said about the outcome of the compromise, that the programme will work and be effective, but it is also necessary to do more. Pelosi believes that this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the wagon of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday night 8 (a mid-European time at 2:00 a.m.) but did not cause a spectacular rendance on the circular.
For the first time on Monday, the House of Parliament votes on the draft legislation for the 2008 Economic Emergency Stabilisation Act on the programme and will be in line with the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made last night and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesman of the White House.
By the way, the programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush Administration, which would have said that the 700 billion dollars would have been spent in the same way for the purchase of low-quality debt securities.
At first, the amount of 700 billion can be spent up to half by using 250 billion immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on Monday, the Ministry of Finance is buying debt-backed securities, and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the President's decision.
The programme will be checked by a special body, including the President of the Federal Reserve.
The utilisation of the 700 billion others depends on the new decision of the Congress.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance may use a combined tactic: you can also purchase bad loans, mortgages and mortgage securities, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can be done in the framework of auctions and directly by the authorities of the Ministry.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in a insurance scheme where the financial portfolio guarantees the means of concern for the payment of a fee corresponding to the expected losses.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary means to get up to $700 billion to the urgent needs of the US financial system, either to buy the wrong assets widely, to avoid the system risk associated with their insurance or the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed - he added it to it.
However, the heads of the banks who have been in trouble and are waiting for state aid can expect to limit their departure money, which the overseas slenger simply calls golden parachutes.
Payments are limited only in some cases, and limits depend on the way the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
In essence, the limitation means that if the Ministry purchases the auction, there will be an extra tax on the golden parachute unless it is retired for the banking manager.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that management funds are not overrun.
The picture includes that the existing gold parachute contracts do not change; the restriction only applies to the new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of executive directors, commented on the measure by Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee responsible for financial services in the House, the Democratic Party.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State is entitled to acquire shares, so the risk of taxpayers is reduced, as they can finally win the transaction as soon as the economy and the rescue bank are backed up with it.
The draft law states that in the next five years, the President will have to submit to the Congress, which provides how taxpayers can recover the expected losses from the financial sector.
There were, of course, people on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens have asked us to protect the dollars of taxpayers - said Darrell Issa Republican, California.
Ohio's Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, believed that the measures were urged by the same people responsible for the collision of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to increase

The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only to a minimum of 0,1 % compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industries also increased slightly by 0,1 per cent compared to July.
The highest price increase in August 2008 was found in the leather product, in the footwear industry (2.8%), mainly due to an increase in prices of 4.6% in the manufacture of bags and silicones and 2.5% in the footwear industry.
Higher prices of plastic and chemical materials have resulted in significant monthly increases in prices of chemicals and products (1.6 per cent).
Price reductions occurred in petroleum processing (1.4%), electrical machinery, equipment production (0.9%) and, to a minimum, wood processing (0.1%) sectors.
The prices of paper production, publishers and printing activities have not changed.
In the other manufacturing industries, price increases between 0.2% and 0.9% were measured.
In August, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors representing a significant weight on the domestic sales of the industry, in particular as a result of the prolongatory effect of the official gas price increase from 1 July.
In a comparison of twelve months, compared to domestic sales of the processing industry, prices increased most in the petroleum sector (32.4 percent).
The production of metal-processing products in the sector of food, beverages, tobacco production has been observed at a price increase of 13.2 per cent, which represents a definitive weight.
Price reductions occurred in textiles, textiles (2.5 percent) and electrical machinery and instruments production (0.3 percent) sectors.
In the other manufacturing industries, price increases ranged from 0.6 per cent to 9,1 per cent.
The manufacturing industry as a whole has grown by 10.2 per cent over the last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded 18.7 per cent of the previous one year.
In August, the largest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was seen in the sectors producing investment goods in domestic sales.
In the consumption industries, consumption goods were increased by 0.3 per cent, and in the energy and further consumption sectors, prices did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the highest price increase was observed in sectors producing energy and further use (16.8%).
In the consumption sectors, we measured a price increase of 6.8 per cent, a reduction of 1.4 per cent in investment goods.
In August, the export sales prices of industry forints increased by 1.1 per cent compared to the previous month, with a decrease of 3,9 per cent in a comparison of 12 months.
In a month, our domestic currency was weakened by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, by 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar, compared with August 2007 by 7.5 per cent, compared to the euro by 15.9 per cent.
You don't need a visa for the United States next year?
Göncz Kinga sees a good chance that the American-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will take place around 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarians.
He believes that "it is all that depends on the timely construction of the electronic entrance system or control system overseas".
At the same time, he called attention to the fact that the new system does not have an entry permit, but tourists will have to register themselves before leaving.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
He meets Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Condoleeezza Rice, who is passed by the Central Cross of the Hungarian Republic Interesting Order to the Star and is conducting discussions with Barack Obama Democratic Advisors to the President of the Republic of John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are next to the rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates of the two major American parties, gave support to the government's savings package of $700 billion on Sunday, but there is a politician who demands the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After the marathon negotiations of the Congress and the representatives of the Administration have been announced on Sunday mornings: the bank rescue package was formally agreed.
The financial package for the Wall Street crisis and the fusion of the frozen credit market has become the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain also show themselves: they are better suited to lead the country out of the economic crisis than their competitor.
According to the latest surveys, Obama has gained some advantages with regard to economic issues again, the melted advantage of McCain, obtained by Sarah Palin Vice-President after the Republican convention.
Obama expressed its hope on Sunday at a campaign meeting in Detroit that the 700 billion package was rapidly adopted by the Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passports which he also supported.
"We must act now, with responsibility (...) your job, your savings, the entire industry, the stability of the whole economy is threatened," he said before the 35 thousand people.
He didn't miss calling McCain's economic ideas out of time.
McCain explained in an interview to ABC, "That's what we're all going to be difficult to swallow (...) but nothing can simply be done".
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal included the setting up of the Committee of Finance Supervisors and the restriction of the end-of-the-art executives, which he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the negotiations, but he had a daily relationship with the Minister.
Premier Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Congress hopefully votes on the draft law on Monday.
The German language area's page
The right-hand camp is intact, only within the camp, the constituents became more self-conscious - so Der Spiegel analyses the weak role of the CSU in Bajor.
Haiders are ready for the government of Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiregel.de)
In its online edition of the German newsmagazine on the left, Franz Walter, the Bavaria revolution, analyzes the causes of CSU’s dramatic defeat.
According to the known politician, CSU's erosion has started long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo had taken over.
Christian socialists have renewed Bajorland for decades, and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
Time shift is also the problem of whole Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising for the CSU, but a process ended on Sunday, which was probable for almost ten years: the incontrovertible haemony of a state party has ceased.
In 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time in the 50s below the 50s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005, so that's what Stoiber said.
This is due to the consistent modernisation carried out by CSU in the range, which will explode his parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very mistaken at the pace. However, it could not have been without consequences for the loyality of the selectors of the CSU in the developmental regions of Bajor.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this are also visible.
The right-hand camp is intact, only within the camp, the constituents became more self-conscious, more critical, more self-focused.
It is also noteworthy that in the last few weeks, the classic civil groups were most distant from the CSU; they are professionals, industrialists, graduates and seniors.
This is where the support of the CSU has been under 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The article "Who, with whom? The parties deal with the conservative situation in the internal policy situation after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The U.S.P. forbids SPÖ to intervene in its internal affairs.
BZÖ is open in all directions for negotiations, and the greens are not yet wanting to negotiate the coalition.
The election took place, and now everything is around the coalition; in the debate on public service television, party leaders barely allowed to see their cards.
President Werner Faymann confirmed that he intends to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPU wants to show that it is indeed possible for the two parties to cooperate - this exists in some regions and social partnerships.
The question is whether a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - with the current president of the ÖVP, as with a alpine clerk - has been open by Faymann.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was completed in any case.
There's no way to repeat this direction.
Molterer responded with caution to the red offers.
As he said, you will certainly not be able to cooperate if Faymann attempts to intervene in the internal affairs of the UVP.
To defend the opposition, or to enter the coalition, for now, it is completely open in the party, questions must be discussed in the UVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ has repeatedly appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take the responsibility of the government," said Haider.
Jóókó: The evil circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which was the host of France representing the European Union’s current Presidency.
In his message to the plenary of the European People's Party, Jókóka, who is a fidest representative of the European People's Party, he called attention to the education segment, because this is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and, in addition, the most serious obstacle to their validity.
The high-level conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Chancengleichheit.
The conference was invited to take place amongst governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka - according to the press paper of the Fides EP Group - warned that, in addition to discrimination in employment, the Roma, primarily due to their low education, would have to get out of the labour market.
"The vast majority of Roma young people have no secondary education, and as a result of low-quality basic education, only an insignificant proportion of them can obtain higher education."
Járóko also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
The congressman believes that it is necessary to make these connections known in the widest circle, including between the Roma and not the Roma.
Because as soon as the Roma student starts school, the chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market are growing, contributing to the national budget through taxes on income and consumption.
"The Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and ensure the eradication of their low-quality and isolated education" said Járóka Lívia.
The representative believes that the European Union's target and action-oriented approach is essential to promptly accelerate school desegregation processes, with the correct implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination guidelines.
"You must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, unemployment, give Roma children the opportunities of democratic space to contribute as a full citizen to the future of Europe," Járóka requested.
The European Equal Opportunity Group, which will be held annually since the European Year of Equality for all in Berlin, aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, the Destiny of Huber-Beckstein Duo
Despite the ugly election failure, heads haven't fallen yet, the tops of the Bajor CSU have yet to discuss personal issues.
Mr. Erwin Huber and the Head of State of Günther Beckstein may still remain in position, questioning how long the grace lasts.
A 17% disaster loss will be decided by extraordinary political parties on the last weekend of October.
In any event, his highly criticized couples perceived: they do not hold all their strength to their chairs.
So they tried to reduce the angered members of the group and the base, who demanded personal concessions one day after the "bajor cunami" because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, even with Edmund Stoiber on the top of his career, the Christian Social Union obtained 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the Stoiber pussy, only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was a "one-off" in Bajorland with 18 percent of German GDP.
However, conservatives are still high in the Southern region of key importance for the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to coalition.
As one of the first signs of intra-parent reconstruction, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and the Federal Minister for Agriculture will also be in the narrow exploration team that will start a fading discussion with free Entrepreneurs who are organising with the liberal FDP and the right-hand values.
The strange finator of fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited by Huber-Beckstein as a couple of puzzles, is entering the list of Free Electioners, and then unpunishedly treated with the big government politician.
The CSU leaders are now using all their energy to stabilize Beckstein somehow.
In the transition, Stoïber, the former Head of Government and former Prime Minister of the CSU, will also have an active role to play as the strongest day of its political career.
On Monday, Huber released a few eptic remarks to the CDU that he thought they would have earned much more support from the Brother Party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag election in September 2009, Merkel cannot be a Chancellor if the CSU, which plays a major role in the national success of 2005, is somehow not set up with a common force.
The disappointing Merkel of the fiasco said that the loss of the soil of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the Great Coalition of Berlin.
What, of course, is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of social Democrats will continue.
The SPD has achieved the weakest result since 1946 in Bajor.
Lukasenko-election: 110-0
No opponent has reached the Belarusian Parliament after the elections on Sunday.
According to the Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability provided in the country led by Aleksandr Lukasenko, but according to the European Security and Cooperation Organisation (ESA) the illegalities of voting counting.
The OSCE sending 450 observers from 43 countries did not recognise the elections.
Although the 100-million country's legislature of 100-million people has been missing opposition for a great decade, the opposition, which was united by the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before the elections yesterday, really hoped that, following the constitutional amendment, Lukasenko, who renewed the presidential mandate for the 2006 debated cleansing elections, would allow the appearance of a number of opposition representatives in this Parliament to take place a quarter of time.
Thus, the ODS had stopped from the well-assessed boycot.
In the context of opposition expectations, Belarus, which has borrowed to reduce the continuously deteriorating Russian gas imports, and also contributed to the transfer of gas pipelines through the country to Belgrada in Russia, wanted to improve its relationship with the EU, where Lukasenko and several high-ranked politicians are not allowed to enter due to the political establishment of Belarus as antidemocratic.
It pointed to a preliminary relief that, when assessing the electoral campaign, the OSCE emphasised positive moves rather than deficiencies, such as banning a third of opposition candidates from leaving.
However, the rapid report from the OSCE on Mondays has already objected to the campaign - where opposition candidates could not essentially appear in the press - and, in particular, that the opposition could not be present in the calculation of votes.
In addition, according to the opposition, there is still a sense of improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been freed and Minsk is willing to make a smaller confrontation with Moscow, which continues to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Belarus constitutes a federal state on paper, has seen the two areas as independent for a month ago.
- We have taken two steps forward, one backwards, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started, said our page Aleksandr Milinkevich.
The opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections would like this to remain, even though "the power was scared to enter even one of the opponents of the unweighted Parliament".
The opposition is not planning to disproportionate actions in view of the results, rather to send a message to the constituents about the need for economic reforms.
- Of course, we have a lot of problems, we need to print the opposition sheets in Russia, and there are obstacles to the presentation by local authorities, but I can still see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly, said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that Lukasenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security to be the main result, even the population of the most officially supported pensioners, is not adequate.
- Due to the growth of the country's debt, the commercial deficit, it is a matter of time to break the social security of "the silence of the cemetery" - thought Milinkewits.
Against opposition politician, the Russian observers considered the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebejeev, head of the mission of the Community of the Independent States, told the Russian intelligence agency Ria Novosty: "The people believe not in words but in actions," so the lack of opposition is evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian electorates.
Brunetta: "Morning only before working hours"
In the history of the Chigi Palace, rotation doors have been installed in a unique way for workers to enter and exit.
From today on, this new measure will take effect against the clients, to filter those who block and then go to drink a coffee at work.
The anti-stopic news has been presented today by Renato Brunetta Minister of Administration and Mr Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office.
"Round gates," said Brunetta, "to work better and more efficiently, to reduce deficiencies and to increase services"
"There will be a new, more responsible and transparent period.
This is the real reform," he stressed Brunetta.
The Chigi Palace will complete the installation of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says "the installation of rotary gates is also symbolically important."
The Secretary-General confirmed: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated."
So breakfast is over during work hours, no more coffee and brios.
Brunetta advises, smiling, "A good little capaccin in the morning at seven, capable of miracles."
At the Roman Public Administration College
At the meeting, the Minister said, "in three months, the deficiencies of the public sector have decreased by 50 percent, which means more jobs than six thousand people in one year".
At the same time, he added that the Italian public administration should be made more efficient
"which, according to the Minister, was twice as much as the private sector in the last 8-10 years, and was much higher than the rate of inflation."
At the same time, thousands of public employees have gathered together, joining the submissions supported by the Italian Environment and Consumer Protection Organisation to protest against the Brunetta Regulation.
"In the meantime, the Minister of Administration is proud of the data supporting the reduction of disease deficiencies, and the 'indulgent solicitors' war continues to grow", says the Consumer Protection Association.
Thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff have gathered across Italy to report wars on the illegal rules of the regulation."
The regional administrative court shall attack, inter alia, the removal of supplementary dietary benefits for medical reasons, the extension of the residence period for workers in sick leave, which means the period within which the patient visitor may appear and several other aspects of the new provisions provided for by the Minister.
Occupational accidents: Napolitano believes that prevention is more important than anything
Every day there are 2.500 accidents at work in Italy, of which 3 deaths and 27 end with permanent disability.
According to the workplace accident insurance data, nearly 1.200 deaths in the workplace have occurred in 2007.
The numbers testify to the seriousness of a phenomena that is still one of the most common causes of death and demands almost twice as many victims as killing.
Today Anmil organises the day of the victims of accidents at work in all districts of Italy, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, for the 58th time to draw attention to this dramatic problem of institutions, social organisations and mass communication.
"The worrying data reported by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the past few days, suggest that prevention plays an extremely important role in accidents at work", stated Giorgio Napolitano in his message to President Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association of the Labour Party.
The Head of State sincerely appreciated the commitment of the association to work prevention, protection of the interests of workers suffering from accidents, assisting family members of the victims and taking public opinion into custody.
"Natural and honestly shared by everyone are incredibly disastrous of this kind, from their sizes, the tragedy that raises the interest of the media and the public, but we have to face dramatic and recurring events in reality every day."
Napolitano openly admits: "We are desperately in a lack of resources, and funding for education and information is crucial.
In-school initiatives aiming at direct information on young people who are getting into the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to maintain interest in this phenomenon, not allowing attention to the social importance of the issue, and more effective legislation that needs to be implemented.
Mr Fini, President of the underhouse, pointed out on his behalf that "the seriousness of the accidents at work at work, the social importance of the conscience of all of us, and the institutions require that this end as soon as possible".
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths such as this is still amazingly high," noted Pietro Mercandelli, Chairman of Anmil.
"We do not want, however, if this decreasing trend, there would be decreasing consideration, because the greatest tragedy occurs when attention is reduced."
"We believe that we are still not doing everything in general to combat this phenomenon, which could be solved through a complex action programme.
In our view, more rigorous supervision and control would be necessary - he stressed Mercandelli - as well as more intensive intervention in the field of labour education, from school education."
"We also need further efforts to inform the public and to make the public feel" he added.
However, what is most important is a more responsible employer environment against a phenomenon that is a social problem."
After that, Mercandelli criticised "the gradual deterioration of the damage net provided to victims of accidents at work" and the "aid trend towards which the system is moving in recent years".
The aim is therefore to give workers back insurance security, because the fate of those suffering from an accident cannot depend on the law-makers where they are arbitrary and where the sharing measures.
MP3 players can cause hearing damage
Residual hearing damage can be caused by listening to portable player devices for a longer time and high volume such as MP3 devices -
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, referring to the opinion published today by the Scientific Committee on Health Risks (SCENIHR) of the EU.
"The opinion shows that 5-10 percent of those who listen to their portable musical player for more than one hour a day for five years, may suffer permanent hearing damage."
"It is worrying that young people who use high-speed portable musical players and mobile phones are not aware that they can damage their hearings irreversiblely," said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific surveys indicate an indisputable risk that we must respond urgently" added the EU Commissioner.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate information on this issue.
In the light of this opinion, we also need to review existing control systems so that they can operate with sufficient efficiency and keep up with the latest technologies."
Brussels has called on the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem in view of the spread of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people who have caused noise.
"The researchers confirm that we have cause of concern and, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, the European Commission is ready to examine the possible measures to be taken to protect children and young people who are exposed to noise protection by portable players and similar instruments," said the Committee Member.
The current European Safety Regulation defines the maximum level of noise that can be released by portable music players at 100 dBs, and however, the growing concern is accompanied by data on hearing damage resulting from the excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as a reduction in the level and duration of noise prices, allowing these hearing damages to be significantly reduced.
The Scientific Committee of the EU notes in its opinion that the maximum value of noise at work for users with a portable player listening to music with high volume (more than 89 decibel) over five hours a week is exceeded.
If someone listens to music in similar circumstances for a long time, after five years there will be a risk of permanent hearing damage.
This affects around 5-10% of those using the portable device, which can also represent 2.5 to 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemano sets up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
Today begins, until March, the results are expected in June.
This is the timetable for the operation of the Committee called "The Future of the Roman Capitals" of the capital government, which was held this morning at the new location behind the Caracalla bath.
For the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop Rome’s directives.
After the end of March, the study and plans will be assessed at the General Assembly and the Board of Governors to submit a strategic plan for the main city officially approved by the Self-Government and the Grand Governor of Gianni Alemano in June.
"It is a completely independent committee in which all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas are represented - and it stresses the role of Alemano - to draw up proposals for the development of Rome's ideas on which political decision-makers, the General Assembly and the Self-Government Committee can rely on.
There is no conflict of competence, but we would only have wanted a platform where major plans for Rome could be created.
In March, after his work, the committee will be dissolved, because he has a mandate for a certain period.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of the Roman Capital of Chairs - said the Prime Minister.
For those who consider that the Commission is not working, in the light of the fact that the opinion it sets up does not have a binding power, Alemanno responds: "All depends on what kind of work the Commission will do and what quality proposals it will put on the table.
If the quality proves to be appropriate, just as in France, in the case of the Attali Commission, which I take certain of Rome, it will play an important role in its contribution.
The political power is often fragmented in day-to-day matters and in dealing with urgent cases from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further, taking account of the peripheral aspects, and we are planning for a longer period of time, and we are committed to working towards the development and future of Rome."
The Mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "This Commission cannot be regarded as useless as a waterhead" because it will absolutely not cost the citizens of Rome a euro, but it serves as an incentive to think and aims to involve the most excellent minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "a open-end and flexible strategic framework is needed, which enables our city to jump in the quality that it needs so much, thinking about the future of a single spirit".
On the future for which the Mayor of Rome stresses, "not only will it be limited to the current municipal framework, but rather far away", not only the future metropolis and the status of the capital, but also "the role that Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean can play as the capital city of the region, and must be filled in".
The first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A known, independent American politician wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first Jimmy Carter was the one who destroyed the American economy with his decisions and developed close relationships with the hostile Islam (as you do today as a private person).
As the elections are nearing, the attacks on Obama are increasing.
A lady in Miami wrote on the Internet, "This man is full of ambitions.
Obama believes that he can gain the highest public dignity of a nation with a total of two governors and five senators to this time."
These attacks are actually vague; of course they are racist, but they do not answer the question of being a good president, and then there are public opinion surveys: they indicate Obama will win with a significant increase.
In this case, there is someone who listens to his feelings and not to his mind.
In the southern States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in its main article: we know that in the ballot banner, the real American patriot will vote for who.
A side of American thinking appears here that remains hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk about what you want, and then we'll know where to put it on Obama or McCain."
Some people swear, if Obama wins, they leave the United States.
Such words have never been said until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all these smartnesses, the winning weapon of the Democrats is George Bush himself.
1 500 people were asked about the mistakes that Bush made during his term of office? 89 percent said Iraq.
America changes.
This nation lost 50.000 soldiers in Vietnam, and he was put in the ass that he flew to home.
In Iraq, 4 500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
However, the majority believe that Iraq was a weak spot for Bush.
It's a huge task waiting for the guy who's going to go to George W.
USA: the economic collapse is already felt by journalists, the time for the restrictions has come in the editorials, and many people blame the Internet for "death" in the printed press.
The PEW Research Institute asked 500 American journalists how they feel about their future situation and mental powers.
Well, right now, almost every journalist's pessimist about his own future.
However, it was not clearly stated that their concerns about credibility were reduced.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
American journalists' problem is money.
They believe that the 2008 crisis is a failing economic model.
There is also a serious problem with the constraints on the newsroom, i.e. the paper editorials.
If we do not want the traditional journalism, in the sense of what the great public understands, to minimise this problem, this must be solved - the questioned journalists say.
Today, American journalism is characterized by a well-looking and complex pessimism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior leaders working in the printed press are convinced that national surnalistics is in the wrong way.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior position.
Printed versus electronic press.
Press staff don't find it difficult to see where the world network is headed.
The biggest publishers are on their way to the Internet, which many people think is the "killer" of the printed press.
Journalists' "economic pressure" increased to 79 percent.
The 500 questioned journalists acknowledged that they put their position alongside technology in the hope that it might benefit from surnalistics.
Today, in the American press, there is a gap between editorial directors, the directors, and the reporters working for them.
At national level, 56 percent of leaders are sure that their reporters share their information with others, while this ratio can only be 23% at local level.
Some of them have made this connection to a secure workplace.
At national level, 47 percent of leaders fear that they can lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this is 30 percent.
In America, the question of "safe job" is on the agenda on team level (for our editors, Serk.).
Only 13% of journalists have a contract.
In the case of a huge nation like the United States with 300 million inhabitants, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and Internet service providers work, employers usually offer as much as they want, so that the thing works on the basis of "support or not".
Directors usually receive high salaries and editors can earn ten thousand dollars per month, plus pension and health insurance.
Freedom, however, is a rather complex principle: the first year is x days, the third one also, until it reaches the maximum 15 days after a certain time.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, are often "healthy" during the year.
It's all about the climate.
UNIPOL: ROMANIC REPUBLIC: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATABAN
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the second criminal denominator of the Roman Court, rejected the request of Danilo Coppola, a resident in the real estate industry, who wanted to visit a Roman apartment from Grotaferrata.
Coppola is being investigated as a result of economic bankruptcy, in the context of an investigation on the Unipol-BNL agreement on the exchange of shares.
During the proceedings against him last week, domestic custody was abolished and changed to a residence ban on Grottaferrata.
Counselors, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked for the property expert to visit the rural small town in the capital.
However, according to the Court, these injuries (for which the prosecutor has proposed a rejection proposal) would allow the company to influence its affairs and access to the evidence against it.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House did not vote for the 700 billion rescue package presented by the White House: a large part of the Americans was more interested and still interested in the penalisation of Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is also supported by the New York Times yesterday, which tells us that the current crisis has resulted in a breakthrough within the Republican Party, which shows a growing division between the traditional, backed-up, eastern coastal attitude to support federal institutions and business circles and the ever-establishing new line against Washington and the financial world in the Central and South States.
This line was identified critically during the parliamentary vote referred to in the introduction.
However, this event is only one of the major changes that the economic transformation that we are still seeing, not only in the United States, but in the whole Western world, perhaps even beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the USA and in Europe, will only speed up the long-lasting phenomena that are consolidated in this new atmosphere and will finally come to light.
The first such phenomenon is re-actualisation, returning a double category of public sovereignty to public awareness, a type of renationalisation of the economy.
Because the crisis affects banking financial institutions which, although they have a close relationship with foreign countries, are primarily, and quite widely, people and families who live in one country, in one state.
This, however, constitutes a direct political challenge for governments: what to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who also choose others.
So the crisis seems to be global in economic terms, but in a political sense, almost exclusively national.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially outside the coast: it is a delicate evidence of the European Union, which cannot set a uniform policy line between different interests and different national strategies.
So everyone is waiting for intervention, rescue package, re-enginement and new rules, but mostly for the opening of funds: because only individual States in a difficult situation have economic resources, financial resources that can be able to regulate things.
They have the tools and their mandate to use them as well: in such circumstances, they have two unreasonable sources that are likely to have no other market and no international organisation in this way.
In addition, the new focus of the crisis on the nation state is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times is a growing factor that is closely linked to this principle: this is territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we have already entered the network, we were convinced that the more sophisticated technology is a rabies world, and we were convinced that the global financial world was ordered to rule the world, we had to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on things that were not the least distracted, such as water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to the other, yet fully linked to a location surrounded by one area.
So whoever controls the area has a much more battling card than he was born for his misfortune in a place where there is no crop, no oil and no water.
This would also change to the second new thing, which is a kind of break-line cell.
Who says that the area, the state, the government, is necessarily saying: politics, other words leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two complications:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership is one of those who can handle the events.
On the other hand, the current management, in particular economic leaders, has led to a complete loss of credit, who proved to be completely incompetent and proven that many of the vague areas ahead.
The two together are even deeper and in a certain way more worrying: the feeling of loss of credit, inconvenience, incompetence and separation, which affects the entire elite of leadership in more and more Western countries.
So it seems that there is a growing number of people who believe that the societal elite time has passed until now, before their actions, their experiences, their lifestyles, their cultures, the complex terms of the word, would have been themselves, so that the social elite is becoming increasingly distracted from the opinion of the majority.
The need for leadership, in an overwhelming but strong delegation movement, will be fed against the dominant division and the traditional political system. This voters did not expect "shooting" or in recent times manifest itself in sudden changes in public mood. For example, the entry of conservatives to power in Austria and Bajor, the collapse of the Labour Party unit in Great Britain, or the repression of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the Italian right-hand victory can be included).
It seems that the traditional elite, party, programs, and even say that in college with its habits, presses and renowned intellectuals, he is getting less and less understandable, so he is able to represent what is going on in the deeper layers of the Western society for a while. Furthermore, the economic crisis is increasing, spreading and potentially capable of creating more undesirable moods.
In spite of all of this, it would be overreacting to speak of "the upcoming rebellion of the masses."
But to be open to eyes, it doesn't hurt at all.
We can go to the wall with a superpowered plug.
With a superpowered glue to defeat gravity and walk on the wall like Spider Man.
This goal was set up by several American research centres, and a group of four institutions is close to the solution.
With just 2,5 square centimetres of glue, researchers managed to attach a 100 kilos of body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
The American magazine TANULMÁNY - A Science published the discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the scientists group was born from the development of special, so-called carbon nano tube structures that exist before.
"The working principle of the glue must be imagined as a package of pipes similar to spaghetti," says Zhong Lin Wang, researcher of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Researchers pulled the idea from the legs of the gekko with microscopic scars, giving the animal a perfect shot.
Tests with various materials, such as glass, teflon and slicing paper, have confirmed that the new glue is ten times more effective than the feet of those reptiles, while "simplifiedly falling off the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher of the engineering arm of the University of Dayton.
"This material can be useful as a temporary glue" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but researchers are thinking more about a less impressive use than the interconnection of electronic devices because carbon nano tubes drive heat and electricity.
You can find another application in the field of space research.
Superheroes can wait.
MÄKES RESULT - the University of Berkeley in California is also experimenting with a new adhesive.
According to the article published in the American Chemical Society c. magazine, scientists in California presented a hair - shaped microfibre tie that is always going through self-cleaning during the movement on the surface, thus always provides a perfect tap.
No medication, no fruit.
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and apple.
These high vitamin-based drinks, especially in summer, are thirsty when they are ingested together with certain life-saving medicinal products, alter their absorption, depending on the case, reinforced or reduced their effects. This may also have serious health consequences.
The professor reported to David Bailey, Professor of Western Ontario, on the risks of the co-administration of the boxer or fresh fruit juices and certain medicines, at his 236th national meeting in Philadelphia: a glass of grapefruit, or orange or apple can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicinal products, thereby preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of the patient.
Grapefruit juice was already on the stage of the defendants, when it was found that some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiety reductions, heart rhythm regulators and neurons could be considered to be toxic to levels.
CLASSIFICATIONS - Two years ago the Italian Medicines Institute itself published the news in an official notice and also warned doctors and patients to take the risks of this combination seriously and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NO GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
The list of active substances that are inhibited by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be extended.
This is what Michele Carruba, professor of the State Department of Medicine at the University of Milan, calls: "These discoveries are generally immediately notified to the various national and international pharmaceutical agencies who, if necessary, ensure that the information contained in the prospectus of the product is changed.
That is why we must always read the information on the intended medicine, and if something is not understood, we should not let ourselves be influenced, but we should clearly ask our doctor or pharmacist," said Ansa Institute's expert.
Paul Krugman received the Economic Nobel Prize
The American Paul Krugman received the economic Nobel Prize for analysis of the territorial context of trade models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old neokeynesian Krugman, Princeton University, teaches and is a well-known publicist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of the economic and foreign policy measures of the Bush government.
A few months after the terrorist attack in September 2001, when Enron bankrupted, Krugman predicted that the last event would have more fatal consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the twin towers.
This projection has encouraged not only a few debates, but it has been put on the eyes of the economist several times, but today we know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised, and I'm a little shocked about how fast the public interest went through the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "principal economist", however, spreading its criticisms against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government in a rather aggressive style.
Open Office, the third edition was worth the "antimicrosoft" package.
Today, OpenOffice.org 3.0 is published in an open package of applications that increase personal productivity, targeting increasingly wide layers as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from free-occupants to administration.
After almost a year of work carried out by SUN Microsystems and voluntary developers, the new Open Office will come to the public with a number of new news: on the welcome screen and outside the re-thinked, less spontaneous user interface, it will offer more significant news. For example, Apple Mac OS X operational system compatibility and supports the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Particular attention has been paid to compatibility with the Office 2007 system, so Open Office can open new enlarged Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting other specific features of some modules, such as that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint displays. This can be useful for emailing files. Another feature supports importing PDF files into the graphics module by keeping the site layout.
You can also create "barrid PDF" documents on this interface that combines the typical Adobe format with the table manager or text editor elements.
Sharing within applications has also been through a number of improvements: the table manager supports the common use of workbooks, but prevents the overwhelming of each other's work. The comments of each colleague are marked with a different colour, which helps to easily identify.
Some companies are already working to make up some of the features of OpenOffice online (on the cloud, on the cloud), so the final version will probably be presented in the next few weeks.
The Italian version, which has been found on the Mirror pages since Friday, can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/Download300.html
The program package is also available for Linux outside the normal Windows and Mac OS operational systems.
On request, we can transfer the installation CD at home or at work.
Freedom is likely to be the most attractive for the spread of home application, but the Open Office package is now trying to kick in the business sector as it can expect a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no lack of ideal education, advice and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open new business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, the text editor according to Word; Calc, the table manager for the replacement of Excel; Impress, Powerpoint presentations; Dbase is similar to the most well-known database manager of Access; and finally Draw is the graphic module.
The 2008 target is to reach 5 million downloads, but if we take into account that we are already at 3.600.000 with the release of the new version, this number will probably be higher than expected.
Kohl's results are positive, that's the fourth doping case.
At the last stage of the Tour de France, the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who competed in the colours of the Gerolsteiner team, has once again produced a positive sample.
The news was on the Equipe website.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor, Riccardo Ricccò and Leonardo Piepol, as well as Stefan Schumacher, German, Gerolsteiner, who produced a positive Cera test as the third-generation version of EPO.
Kohl's blood sample, similar to the tests carried out in the past few weeks, has been tested by the labs in the same way as in the last few weeks.
If the control tests also confirm the positive Cera result, Austria loses its third position and, according to the requirements, is banned for two years from competition.
The positive outcome of Kohl's third-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and informed the Associated Press with the news agency: signaled the positive doping progress to the Austrian authorities.
The 26 - year - old Austrians were able to stand behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and won the best hill-fashioned throttle.
NEW YORK TIMES FOR THE WORK OF ITALIAN WORK?
It has only recently changed from Italy to one of the most popular targets of immigrants who have been attracted to the rejection.
That's why it turns into the "Belpaese" racist nation? This is the New York Times, which is based on the young Burkina Faso Abdul William Guibre, who was killed in Milan last month, because he stole a box of biscuits, devoted a long article to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is well characterised by what the New York Times calls "the paradox of the nests": in the northern regions, "the strongest of integration and the highest employment" is, at the same time, "the anti-migrant and the support of the North League" is also the strongest in the country.
The NYT also quotes cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno to support the increasing tension between Italian and immigrants.
In fact.
The new laws demanded by Liga, which would strengthen the sparkling of immigration and facilitate the removal of illegal immigrants, have been set up as an example of a mood change in Italy.
The President of the Pope and the Republic also stressed this trend: "Giorgio Napolitano has met the XVI Bened in the Quirinale Palace and called on the state and the Church to work together to overcome racism".
Students suffer from expensive rental fees, with a room of up to 900 euros
The market for accommodations to universities is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the Housing Rental Association, a student can pay up to EUR 900 for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomena has already spent such amazing sizes, which, because of the total cost of families, blocks the wide layers of students from the opportunity to learn" explains Laura Mariani's head of Sunia's study office. "In these cities, the high demand for students has distorted the market to such an extent that a general cost-benefit process has also started against the local residents."
In most cases, property offers also include a series of irregularities: non-registered contracts with non-rescribed rent restrictions, connected with sub-price.
According to Sunia, an extraordinary measure would be needed which would create an opportunity to maximise prices by reviewing the tax system.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, around Brianza, the cost of a single room is €450 for a bed; the price of a single room ranges from €650 (Bande Nere) to €800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) on average, but can also reach €900 (Vittoria).
In Florence, an average bed cost 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where a large number of students live in a neighborhood near the university, a bed cost 250/280 euros if they are doubled and EUR 370-500 when it comes to a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are requested for a single person and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Somewhat cheaper (550 euros in a single room) are prices in other universities (Ostense and Cinecittà).
In the suburbs, you can save everything: 300 euros is a bed and 450 is a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, they request a bed of 300/450 euros for a room from 400 to 600 euros. The price is highest in Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bariban, 250/350 euros are to be paid for a bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they represent a greater weight within the city's budget.
In cities such as Perugia where students outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, there is also another disorder: the rental fee for foreign students is approximately 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
See you, old Cinema Paradiso, in the cities, the time of old movie rooms
Traditional cinemas are closed in favour of the Multiplexes.
"A city where there's no movies, a blind city, like a face without eyes."
The pictures made by director Giuseppe Tornatore are effective in showing everything that happens in the Italian capitals but also in rural areas.
The suppression of cinemas - the appearance of large multi-territorial cinemas in the outdoors, and, as a result, the coincidence in the city centres - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time it bears all the characteristics of a genuine cultural crime.
When places with historical and memories disappear, "it's like our friend's going away, a friend who shared our way and many experiences," says director of Cinema Paradise. The film, 20 years ago, was an Oscar award and the grand prize of the Cannes festival, the story of a small-town movie, the story of Lirians in the city, is about the desire, after a movie that may have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, the data reported by Anec, is clear: 316 traditional film theatres have been closed in the last five years. The biggest losses were recorded in the cinemas in major cities: 10 film theatres closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Torino and 5 in Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna, one of the most affected regions, lost 82 single-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that, for their disappearance, multiplex depletion is not better proven than the highest number of newly opened multi-territorial cinemas in these three regions of Italy: in the last five years, the number of rooms increased by 195 in Lombardia, 81 in Tuscany and the same amount in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says President Anec, Paolo Protti. "It's fine that we build new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a urban cinema is closed, not all of the passengers are willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the unloaded financial funds for the support of operators: the debt of the State expired can be amounted to around EUR 10 million.
It is also ethical and morally shameful that the government does not comply with existing legislation.
It would be necessary to maintain the market between €16 and €18 million per year."
This is the first Italian city that decided to resolve the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec in order to protect and boost a single-terrestrial cinema in the outer and downtown city.
The provisions would include tax reductions to operators and the benefits to the public to facilitate accessibility: the viewers can drive into restricted zones and park with preferential tariffs in certain parking areas.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will be taken, even by introducing other measures, but they will follow Bologna's example.
However, it is also certain that traditional cinemas need to improve the sound and image quality, because today's audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of the traditional cinema was always an important issue for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my child and my youth, gave me the spark that finally made Cinema Paradiso, although I've been wondering about it for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the Via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale, so that I don't see the black posters from the dust, I'd rather turn my head around.
Close links between politics and 'ndrangheta, arrested Mayor Gioia Tauro
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromale Clan in municipal decisions".
Major charges have been filed against the Mayor and Vice-President of the Calabria Anti-Mafia Board, Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning on the charges of external participation in the cooperative.
Bilincs were also placed in the hands of Gioacchino Piromalum, a senior intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and a lawyer named the chief, who was previously convicted of participation in a Mafia-like crime cooperative, and a compensation of EUR 10 million.
"Neglect of any legal and moral rule, more for good taste," writes state prosecutors. The two local authorities have expressed their intention to pay a consultative fee to Piromalu lawyer.
"So the clan would have been officially entering the city house, which would have given additional opportunity to control and control the administration, which could be said to be significant.
Agazio Loiro, Chairman of the General Assembly of the region of Calabria, does not hide that there are a number of conflicts in the region between local institutions and organised underworld: There are areas where the spread of the Mafia is stronger than elsewhere where the confrontation will be almost inevitable.
Many local politicians, however, are resisting the pressure of the ndrangheta, they are the heroes who remain clean.
This morning's arrests are the continuations of the events in July, when the police announced that it was possible to decompress the Piromalle Clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were exempted from their mandate for government administration. Gioia Tauro's municipal committee was once dissolved in 1991, even because of organised crime and suspected links between the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Christian Democrat, who was revolting at the expense of the dissolution, was the head of the right-hand coalition in the second round of 2006.
He shouted scandal when the County Board ordered the dismantling of the municipality committee.
Mr. Marco Minnini, former Minister of Interior, was quoted to the Court of Justice, accusing him of having planned everything politically, but in the arrest order signed this morning, the court explained that he was bold to demand a change in the A3 project.
According to the ordered hearing against Dal Torrione, the public prosecutors write that "it was perpetuous to meet the demands of an extensive group of entrepreneurs, who are known to be close to the Piromale family, to submit the decisions of the municipality to the clan interests."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come.
It's an exhaustable energy source, which accounts for 70 percent of the planet's surface, which is only discovered by the large international energy companies.
Hulls, sea flows, cliffs, renewable energy sources, whereby giants like Chevron, who are now trying to put their hands on them.
They've been investigating the possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea for a hundred years. In the '70s, research has increased during the first oil crisis.
By 1980, when the price of petroleum decreased, the idea of utilising marine energy has been neglected, but today the demands of environmental protection and the recurring of the price of petroleum will give the sector a new boost.
According to the London World Energy Council (WEC) 2007, 15% of the world's electricity demand could be covered by installations that use sea waves.
This amount is twice what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
In addition, the currents and the currents would still be there.
The giants are in progress.
Enersis was the first company that committed itself to maritime energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant to be set up in North Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary step when the signature was announced.
It's been two years since, and more and more companies are taking a stand for maritime energy, including those who have so far been committed to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the energy-saving technologies of the oceans and considering the possibility of cooperation with us," stated the speaker of one of the associated companies of the American oil giant, the Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question relates to the obtaining of the authorisation necessary for the launch of the sub-sidiary project for the utilisation of marine energy issued by the American Energy Committee.
It is not of minor importance, especially when we take into account the fact that the United States is currently carrying out oil extraction in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
Beyond Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. and Ocean Power in New Jersey are also in the way of energy that can be obtained from the sea.
The technology is waiting for development.
According to the experts, it is still an initial technology, just because the energy from the sea does not disperse the doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities such as Portugal or Scotland are both small sizes and therefore are not causing too much problems with ecosystems.
However, in order to produce more energy at a higher level, installations that also have a significant environmental impact are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power uses a connected boy system, for example.
The impacts raised by waves and moving the booins are converted into hydraulic pressure by plungers and cylinders placed in them.
Pressure is a turbine that feeds a generator.
Electricity reaches the ground on cables below the sea.
For now, there are four similar installations in the planning phase, which are only waiting for the federal license. Some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started energy production for a shopping centre and a parking lot with six submarine turbines located in the East River Sea Coast of New York.
The flow of water rotates the plates of the turbines, and this rotation feeds the generator.
Verdant stated that he has a long list of partners waiting for authorisations only for the use of energy.
It's a cliff after waves.
At present, special attention should be paid to the opportunities that can be exploited through the price course.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, the price field is more predictable than wind, sun or waves, so it is considered to be a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal States spent 7.5 million dollars in 2008 to exploit the energy provided by the price course. This amount is expected to rise to 35 million in 2009.
