There was a nine-year-old boy on the trip to Tampere.
The police have been on a search mission for a 9-year-old boy on his escape in Tampere on Tuesday night.
The disappearance report on the boy that left west of Tampere with his friend has spread in the social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and he has no risk of life and health.
The boy's father told him at midnight that he was found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the reconciliation.
They found the boy in the neighborhood of the home, Dad told me.
Ronaldo again as a squirrel... torch the paint difference into the Mess
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five paintings in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his factory in the Master's League.
The conflict between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo about the goal of the Master’s league turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid, Ronaldo, moved to the top of the world's painter statistics alone when he shot a visitor in Shahtar Donetski's network with two hits of punishment traps and one of the play situation.
Ronaldo raised his paint balance to 80, when the Barcelona Mess, which was on Tuesday with him, had 77 hits.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has been struggling in the Italian football League at Seriee A since the first year, but at the D block of the Master League, it started with a strong 2-1 guest profit from Manchester City.
The winner made over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack bored Sergei Aguero's absence to his knees.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's ball game, came to the field only with the last ten minutes.
The other company of Manchester, United, also experienced hardships in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after the death of 1-2.
ManU's 20-year-old law supporter Luke Shaw's guest game took only 15 minutes.
The dangerously-looking strap of PSV Hector Moreno hit the target towards the attacked ManU package so badly that Shaw probably broke his leg.
Shaw was lying at the Eindhoven home stadium for about a decade before the medical staff left to take him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests in the 41st minute to 1-0 lead, but ManU's joy took only a few minutes.
Moreno set it up in an extra time before the break.
In the second half, the winner of the PSV was made by Luciano Narsingh.
Paris Saint-Germain, the A-block, started in the Master's League of Painting.
This was the case with Angel Di Maria, Argentinian, switched to the PSG shirt of Manchester United.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball across the back corner of Malmö's goal guard Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made a second half-time PSG 2-0.
The PSG has been speculated to be among the successors of the season.
The presumption is not wrong, but the malmö of the league is not the best possible benchmark.
For the first time, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Starfighter of the PSG, confronted his professional career with Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team, Moscow TSKA, lost the B-game in Germany for Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately demanded a divorce - the president held the wrong speech.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, held the same speech he had held a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has held the same speech in the country's parliament that he held at the end of last month.
When Mugabe spoke 25 minutes ago, apparently didn't realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was in full spirit.
The main opposition party, MDC, asked Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusing had just happened in the Mugabe Bureau and that the President had not done anything wrong.
Mugabe's speech was earlier and now about China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extra summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented next week an additional EU leaders summit because of the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council leading the summit, Donald Tusk, assessed the request.
According to the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how they will be able to register more effectively in Europe.
According to Merkel, the negotiations on the quotas for asylum seekers are part of the table of the Ministers of Interior.
Teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during the emergency call.
The sound is just a bit of a colored university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "good dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contacts of the dead woman’s neighbors were found on the phone.
In the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten message on the page of the hostage: "I am so sorry that I could cancel this lover Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," said in a letter that, according to experts, is signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University of Minnesota Cleveland, had already traveled nearly 500 km to the school campus where the police believes that he shot and killed the teacher of the history, Ethan Schmidt, had been in this office.
Lynn Buford, Head of Police at Delta State University, told the university staff about the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb called the fatal emergency call a while after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose one more: Lamb committed suicide when a police officer was surrounded by a plague.
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb’s motive the day after the students and the staff had to hide behind locked doors because of the school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, which, however, had problems.
Students told me they waited for her hours.
The police of the Moratorium of Prentiss, Gautier, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in the book that he wrote, thanking the “great people ” with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in an institution of social sciences and history with a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers congratulated Lamb, but said that he also seemed nervous and uncomfortable, "as if something was wrong."
Another student in Mikel Sykes said Lamb told me that he had a lot of stress at the end of the year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for sickness from Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the principles of the university’s remuneration meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not reverse automatic career development and the role of the assistant professor.
Principal William LaForge said that he knew there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "surely there was something in Lamb's mind."
These are the questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
After Lamb had escaped from the campus, the police came after him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a half a mile south of the house of his parents in the suburbs of Mississippi Greenville, said Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running on the yard.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught math and educational science. There are 3500 students at the university and it is located in a town with about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb did a doctoral study in educational science in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 years old when they met through friends together.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who had been trying to teach Hairton to play guitar for many years.
He was quite a charmer in those days.
All the girls were melting wax when she was there, now the 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's front town in Brandon.
Looks like Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he had killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them at a riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was okay.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Sten, told me they broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really shocked," O'Sten described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O' Steen told me he hadn't met Lamb, but he had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they used to play together with some work.
O' Steen told me his daughter was doing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a number of different network companies.
The barkeeper of the Juliep Room, near Gautier, and the timely entertainment systemer Mike Shaffer tells us that he saw Lamb and Prentiss last night on September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and lipharp performance for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We messed with each other. We threw up a bunch of spoils.
So they were both pretty clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first year's student seminar program and was specialised in Indians and colonial history, told the English teacher Don Allan Mitchell of the school.
Schmidt was married and had three little children.
He studied emporia in Kansas at State University and was the chairman of his brotherhood and student government.
On Tuesday night at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, approximately 900 people participated in a candle chart, including education and other staff, students and members of the Community.
Schmidt’s wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the fair during which the university’s choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The teaching will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report on Mississippi Cleveland.
The Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus from Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police are saying that Lamb has now called the emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and even though I referred to him as the wife of Prentiss during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us intends to hire less employees for the holiday period
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many employees for the holiday period as last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that current regular and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it intends to hire 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, with a total of 45 000 hired in the 2014 holiday period.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that the interviews of applicants will start this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of vacation, the Christmas shopping period is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help in the occupation of shops and the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The first night of the film was a huge moment of professional importance for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theatre waiting for the royal arrival, and I realized that I was sitting next to me was empty, and then I realized that the place of Princess Diana was next to me," he said the coming documentary picture in Back in Time trailer.
The movie starts and I think I'm just a telegram and a hand stretch away from dates with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary of the "Return to the Future", interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckisi and Managing Director Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future got her first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's for me, no doubt, it's the finest time travel film ever."
Back in Time is available as order video, DVD and some film theatres in October.
The UN leader says that the situation in Syria will not be resolved armedly
The answer of Secretary-General Ban Ki-mon to the fact that Russia will increase military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict does not "resolve armedly" and the additional weapons only aggravate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN Head again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban said that he would meet the ministers of the five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in the context of the General Assembly of Ministers later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted the fact that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces "is impossible to resolve the situation".
Mr Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate solidarity and consensus in dealing with the Syrian crisis as they demonstrated when the Iranian nuclear programme was reconciled.
8 support surveys showing that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to mark him as a windstorm.
Others just think he's a joke.
Some are waiting for a crash.
Although some Republicans have tried to neglect Donald Trumps from the top of the support surveys, it has not succeeded (new).
From the latest 11 national surveys, Donald Trump has been headed by a two-digit number, and some have seriously wondered what this means for the capacity of the real estate king to be appointed.
Of course, the election season is only at the beginning.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
The commentators point out that at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing its leadership for the rising Herman Cain, both of whom did not get any state back in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, external groups, such as Jeb Bushin Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organisation Club for Growth, have noted the trump's stiffness and began to use its funds to fall.
The following recent support surveys suggest that the real estate king is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity numbers have made a complete translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his nomination in mid-June, the Monmouth University support surveys showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first preparatory states.
In a support survey by the University of Quinn market in Iowa last week, 60 per cent of the Republicans said that they welcomed Trump.
Two thirds of the Republican voters would be pleased if Trump became candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they would either be "inspired" or "contempt" if Trump was candidate.
Only two out of ten said they'd be "shattered" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson produces some of the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent of "involved" vs. Trump 40 per cent).
Next, the most enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio's only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters would be "unhappy" or "developed" if Jeb Bush, the favourites of the authorities, became candidate.
The fire nature of the trump is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpia has been widely criticised for his magnificent speeches and insults, according to the Post question of Monday ABC News/Washington, 52 per cent of the voters who are dependent on the Republicans at national level thinks that the real estate king has the right quality for the president.
According to the Quinn Market Survey last week, in the first party meeting in the state of Iowa, the figure is the same: 52 per cent of the Republicans think that Trump has the right character for the leader.
However, according to ABC/Post’s survey, 44 per cent thinks that his nature is not suitable for the President's operation, and almost six out of ten believes that his nature is not part of the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump as the most likely option in asking who is most likely to be appointed as a candidate for Republicans.
At the end of July, four out of ten were in favour of Jeb Bush.
Publication of information: People from the Republicans Party have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball in their possession.
During the last parliamentary term, four of the ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry was appointed as a candidate, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of the voters of the Republican Party find the Trump campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans were to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have noted that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump’s leadership because the support against Trump has been divided among many other candidates.
However, a survey conducted at the beginning of September by Monmouth University showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives the majority of support in almost all cases.
He runs Carly Fiorina 13 points, Marco Rubiota 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
He's in line with Ted Cruz.
The only winning candidate in Trump?
If they were set up on the other side, Ben Carson would win businessman Trump with a big 18-point difference.
Just and just the majority of Donald Trump's supporters have stated that he has made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump have decided who their voice is going on.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can be absolutely sure that he would never change his mind.
46% said that they could possibly change the candidate.
In any event, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, the neurochirurg Ben Carson, but those voters who said they had made a decision are twice more likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "prisoners" in his campaign analysis speech, migration has been at the center of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s magnificentness drives Latinists away from the Republican Party and damages rebracing companies.
According to the new ABC/Post survey published Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the center of things, it is also Donald Trump.
The neglect to the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, mostly due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in the ABC/Post survey on Monday that they prefer to choose a non-political person rather than one with a government experience.
They're also angry with the federal government.
The two weeks ago Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey in Iowa showed that three of the four Republicans of Iowa are frustrated by the Republicans in the Congress: 54% are "unhappy" and 21% are "really angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first performance in Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first presentation in Question Time has been enthusiasticly expected since his choice.
The new leader of the Labour People's Party, Jeremy Corby, is confronted with David Cameron for the first time in the Prime Minister Question Time.
Corby's coming up to ask her first six questions a little after half a day, and it is likely that both the media and the MPs of the Labour Party have closely watched her performance.
Corby's insisted on this weekly act of "slower theatre and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave some of the occasions to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary trial for Corbyn's leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke on Tuesday at the annual meeting of the Association of Trade Associations.
At the same time, the decision of the Labour Party to stand silent during the national song during the Tuesday Memorial Service, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Fighting of the British Air War, has raised criticism of the Conservative Party's nationalists and has appeared in several frontpage cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national song has attracted attention.
Corbyn's representative said to him "with respectful silence" and that he acknowledges "the braveness of the Royal Air Forces in the British Air War".
The member of the Corbyn shadow government, Owen Smith, said to the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he would have called the Labour Party's leader to sing a national song despite his view that the Royal House should be lifted.
Almost a dozen of the shadow ministers have refused to join in the Corbyn area, calling for differences in economic, defence and external affairs, which, initially, was supported by less than a sixth part of the parliamentary party as a leader.
The BBC policy correspondent, Robin Brant, says that the differences in line between the position of the party in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have been "recovered" even within the Labour Party after the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said at the meeting of the Associations of Trade Associations that the Labour Party would propose a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the secretary-general of the shadow government, Smith, said that the party was "very clear" in relation to the fact that they only object to the government's plans to calculate the ceiling from 26 000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party, which David Cameron has encountered in the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Director of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to policy and now says that he has "combined" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
Mr Corby, Member of the Islington North region, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's survey hours is too controversial and that he intends to abstain from both clever wording and squeezing, and, instead, allowing him to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the secretary of the shadow government, will act as his assistant in Question Hours when Corby is not involved - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corby has also proposed that other colleagues may sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the President of the subcommittee, Mr Bercow, on the subject.
When Cameron was in charge in 2005, he said that he wanted to move away from a political theater that is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Hours, but later he had to admit that he failed.
Since they were televisioned in 1990, the Prime Minister’s Question Time has been an important indicator for assessing the ability of the Director to consider, the control of his sub-house, and his position in other nationalists, although critics have criticised the survey hours of becoming only an illusion that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Adults of homeless youths are trained as photographers
The center of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighbourhood and gain it.
BBC News met one of the first young people who had completed the project.

The value of the puzzle is rising in Britain's wage growth
The value of the puzzle jumped up after the numbers appeared to increase in the UK wage growth, while at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same time last year.
The growth rate was the fastest after 2009 and was considered to bring estimates of the increase in courses.
The weight rose to over a per cent dollars against $ 1.505, and € 0.84 per cent against €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at a 1.49% increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinct share of the market and increased by 20% after AB InBev approached it.
The agreement would combine two of the world's largest breweries and bring brands together, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share increased by 0.9 per cent after the competing luxurious product group in Richmont received encouraging news.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China, which is Burberry's key market, had started to grow again.
The shares of Glencore rose by 5 per cent after the mining waste told me that it had collected $2,5 billion by launching shares as part of its debt cut strategy.
Packaging and Paper Group Mond's shares were the largest factor in the index by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendation from the company to "sale".
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports view company published information on its half-year income before taxes: 83 per cent increase to 46.6 million pounds.
According to the director of JD Sports, higher wages can damage enlargement
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage of employees is raised in Great Britain, that may mean "the purchasing power of potential consumers will grow".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher cost of the company’s labour costs, says Cowgill.
The costs could be related to the company's enlargement plans, he added, which would mean less jobs.
Metcash starts a grassroots campaign against entry into Ald's field
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Ald's attack in South and West Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA-traders in South and West Australia before Ald attacked by $700 million.
At the same time, Metcash and IGA-supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food intermediaries and build IGA brands through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and buyers have jumped in, and brands such as the ice-cream manufacturer Simmo's from Dunsborough offer tastes in IGA shops, and the owners sell discount tickets to their Australian football matches to their main customers.
Metcashin is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and iron goods organises the annual strategy day of investors.
There is a lot in the game, as Southern and Western Australia represent almost 30% of Metcashi's IGA area, with higher yield margins than the IGA network of the Eastern States of Metcashi.
Visitors from South and West Australia are known to be corners, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the West compared to 14% in the Eastern States.
Analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi catches around 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first movements.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers can lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash can lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year in the south 25 and in the West 30 movements, which produces a turnover of $500 and $600 million in these regions.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcashi's high fixed cost base can cost Metcash about $13 million of operating losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA's customers were most faithful.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi’s food and food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Investment Fund and founder of the Magellan Financial Group Hamish Douglass said at business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "be the most likely to lose in a decade".
Metcash has refused to respond in public to Douglas' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcashi Board would have contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA has declined from 18% to 14% since 2010, and the revenues from Metcashi’s food and food business, which distributes products to some 1200 IGA resellers, have decreased by 43% since 2012. This indicates a reduction in debt financing for operations when there is pressure on sales and margins.
The wholesaler, however, has invested more than 150 million dollars a year in calculating the prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA resellers to repair their shops by increasing faster growing fresh food and bringing on the market a better range of private labels.
Ian Morrice, President-in-Office of Metcashi, says that price reductions and sales improvements have increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the growth of the profits in 2017, for the first time for four years.
Steve Healy, Chairman of the Australian Tennis Union supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a sideline in the recent storm, which has flipped around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more honor than criticism of his own behavior, says Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis union.
The younger member of the talented twin named "Special Ks" Kokkinakis was unwilling to be public about the case in which Kyrgios irritated Stan Wawrinka Montreal Masters.
Shortly after this, the Cincinnati head emperor had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared, "Wawrinkan should have beat Kyrgios, and I should have beat that kid."
Even though Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up his mile after the cramp ruined his possible victory from Richard Gasquet in US Open, Healy has been an impenetrable defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth from another place in double games with Bernard Tomic at Davis Cup's semifinal against Britain.
"I'm pretty strong in the opinion that Thana's just been dragged into the wreck," Healy said.
He broke his mile when he lost his cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his mile in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently, including in some provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, has a fine family around him, and I think he has been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature to be 19 years old, he works hard, fits in the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he exercises firmly, is in good condition and is quite a calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged according to his earnings.
Healy has also supported the decision not to involve Kyrgio in important games starting on Friday, describeing this 'common decision' as a good solution for all, but still supporting the return of the Canberraner to the team's longship.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not on everything around [Cyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen very quickly, like Federer and Murray, and he grows up in public and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and for him if he spend some time out of publicity thinking about these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, blocks borders, arrest immigrants
Hungary declared an exception and closed its Southern border against Serbia by securing those who tried to enter illegally, with the aim of emigrating the flow of migrants in the country.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered into a neutral area, and the Serbian authorities reacted by terror.
People who have fled the violence of their homes have now set up their tents and settled for an unspecified period between the inspection stations of two countries.
However, frustration increased.
As the police helicopter stayed above them, the immigrants called "Open the border!" and screamed insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water for protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is "unacceptable" for the return of migrants from Hungary when they arrive all the time from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, does not cause any damage to civilians.
Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
There was a confusion between Hungary and Serbia on the border after the 28 nationality group failed to create a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed on the division of responsibility for 40 000 people who are now taking refuge in Italy and Greece, and the ministers were hoping to reach the final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - which EU countries are taking 120 000 additional sanctions, including some of Hungary.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demand an additional EU summit on Tuesday next week to discuss the country's migration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will be working in the near future.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to take action in the crisis and allowed you to be closed and to speed up asylum cases.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Sijjarto said that, now that the fence at the border with Serbia is ready, the country will also set its border on the tide against Romania to stop immigrants from flooding across the country.
The CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the wire line between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and the largest point of entry to the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of those who arrive are searching for a better life for economic refugees, and not those who are running from the war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly inconsistent with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force in the middle of the night in Hungary now describe a company as a criminal offence to exceed or damage a 4-metre (13 feet) wire board that has been built by the government on the southern border against Serbia, and contain further prison sentences for convicted persons traders.
"The situation caused by mass migration has led the Hungarian Government to declare an emergency situation," Zoltan Kovacs, a government reporter, told journalists in the southern Szeged city.
We are very clear about this: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally accept the expected military assault for next week, but the journalists of Associated Press at the border have seen heavy armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Homeland Security Adviser of Orban, said that the authorities had captured 45 people trying to cross the border, and 15 more than the land.
They got over the fence by harming the fence, now being imprisoned by the police, and they are charged with the offences specified in the new laws.
The authorities will quickly fix the fence.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossings from the border against Serbia after they had sent a steering wire to close one of these places.
The main border crossing point near the Hungarian Roszkea was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for human treatment, and the crowds invaded it.
About 20 got in, but thousands of them were out.
One group of immigrants blocked the main motorways between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 elections: According to a national survey, the head of Hillary Clinton has narrowed down on the side of Bernie Sanders
The former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Clinton, continues in a two-digit championship, but Senator Bernie Sanders put him down.
Clinton now supports 47% of the Democratic voters (from 58%), and the second Sanders supports 27% (from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he is going to join the presidential contest, but he is in favour of 15% of the Democratic voters.
More than five months before the opening of the preliminary elections, the majority of democratic voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who are voting for.
However, Clinton's supporters stand tighter behind their choice than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen in several population groups since the CBS News Poll survey last month, and Sanders has risen somewhat at the same time.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his heads have gone down.
His popularity among men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's predecessor in the circle of under 50-year-old democratic voters has disappeared, and now he's at level with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders with a double number in the liberals, but now Sanders runs this group by five percentage points.
Approximately half of the country's democratic voters say that they are inclined to support Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
The fourth says that he supports him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that the current supporters of Clinton are very likely to be enthusiastic in supporting him.
The minds are more confusing with those who are not in favour of Clinton at the moment, and only a quarter of them would be inclined to support him.
Where 48% of the Democratic voters say that they would enthusiasticly support Clinton, the Republican One, Donald Trump, says the same thing as the fewer Republican voter (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had the right experience (16%). The most popular answers were that now is the right time for the female president (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the mission (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the Vice-President has an impact on a possible presidential candidate, 57% of the Democratic voters would already want to see him in the race, even though a third disagrees.
When asking the Democratic Voters who they would choose for the second party's nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say that they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue the candidateship of the Democrats, Hilary Clinton's leadership in Sanders will grow.
55% of the democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance to win the presidential elections, but this figure has declined from 78% last month.
With this standard, Biden stays far away, but the proportion of those who consider him the most voter has grown.
However, when the democratic voters were asked what was most important in the candidate, they raised opinions above voting.
Even in the last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate was regarded as an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are well able to deal with certain key issues among the voters of their parties.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden's best out of three in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
30% of democratic voters say that Clinton is not honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally consider that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
When we look at all these points, about a quarter of the democratic voters say that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server while he is still a foreign minister raises questions, the majority of Democratic voters are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and says that it did not affect their public opinion on him.
However, it is different when we consider America as a whole.
Half the Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about a third is satisfied.
In March, the public’s opinions were divided shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans say that the e-mail was not influenced by their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinions have worsened.
More than six out of ten Republicans say that their opinions about Clinton have become worse.
Although the voters of Clinton's own party consider him to be honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all the registered voters. Only 32% thinks he is honest and reliable, and this figure has decreased by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points after May.
62% of registered voters say that Clinton is not regarded as being honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 per cent of the country's registered voters do not consider the Trompia honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trumps are regarded as good leaders.
The six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush, are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many have no opinions about him, just as Carson does.
The error margin in the study involving 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national survey
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates gathered half of all votes in the new survey, leaving others to fight for footwear.
Republican voters throughout the country continue to support Trumps, whose support has risen from 23% of the CBS survey published on Tuesday 27% in the previous year before the Vote of Fox News.
At the same time, however, Carson rose greatly from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing very well with the various demographic groups and is displaced among the high-school Republican voters of Trump.
The rest of the field has remained behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasich of Ohio. The support of Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin has declined most: from 10% last month to 2% today.
The former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida are on a third position at 6%.
The error margin in the sample of this latest survey of 376 Republican voters in September is +/- 6 per cent.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson was rising in the surveys: he has 19% support for the Republicans, and Trump is 32% above him.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was significantly above Carson.
When Carson's favor was rising last week, Trump criticized the retired neurochirurg for nothing, even though Carso apologized for the questioning of Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday on his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died in a brotherhood ceremony in the Pocono Mountains region of Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been charged with five people.
Members of the Baruch College in New York City, Pi Delta Psi, brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a memberial dispute in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thereby contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng’s eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a bag of over 13 kilo full of sand, and then repeatedly he was stabbed to the ground when he was trying to walk through the iced field towards the goal.
Finally, Deng complained that his head hurts, and then he lost consciousness.
Brotherhood members didn't call the emergency number after Deng fainted, but according to the charges, they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, to look for information on his symptoms on the network, and to contact Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood, asking for advice, Chief of Police Chris Wagner reported at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their ritual facilities and, in practice, put the well-being of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
Deng wasn't allowed to revitalise, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received repeated boring attacks on the head, body, and travel.
"At least many families have been suffering from a brotherly clinic when at least one student has died every year since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in his statement.
The brothers and their members must be responsible, and this step is important for the authorities.
The grand jury in Monroe County supported the fact that the first five members were charged with a third degree murder.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent smuggling and criminal compulsion.
"We do not want to be responsible only for individuals; if there is a organization behind what has happened, which has officially or informally accepted the situation, they must also be held responsible," Wagner said on Tuesday at the press conference.
Baruch College told the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood to burst their connection to the local department.
This is what happens when the US Central Bank raises interest rates
The level of interest will come, and the market for rising rates will fall, the income of bonds will rise and the economy will have to fall.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long it takes to do all this or how long it will take.
The past is very little helpful in timing, as it comes to the economy.
The return has lasted only 11 months after the first lift, and sometimes it has taken as long as 86 months.
The aggression of the US Central Bank in the increase of interest rates has often, although not always, been determined by the way economic and financial assets react.
That is why officials of the United States Central Bank have so strongly emphasised that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are being raised, but mainly on the development cycle of the time to normalise the situation.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
However, in the end, market participants may find that all interest rates have been overrated.
"The first post-global economic crisis increase of the Central Bank is inevitably interpreted in some circles for the end of the "low money" era," said the capital Economics head economics expert Julian Jessop, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest rates to normal, although still low, to the level of such a revolutionary shock that many people seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it does not have any effect.
The following is a review of how some economic sectors will react on the basis of previous developments:
As has been seen on the market in the last approximately a month, waiting for a raise of the interest can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect delays in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank's analysts said in a recent study about what happens after the central bank's increase.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, at an increase of approximately 14%, 250 days after the increase is relatively stable (mean increase of 2.6%), and the normal value has been achieved after 500 days with average return in the last six cycles of 14,4%, is reported in the recent analysis of the Nuveen Asset Management company’s leading capital strategy, Bob Doll, published in Barron's.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on the shares is generally clearer at the late stage of the increase cycle when income begins to fall.
Returns are part of the economy, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges which have not been present and which can accelerate the recession.
This is in particular a gross domestic product that will be closest to its lowest level of all times before the central bank's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 increases since 1950, the nominal annual GDP has only been below 4.5% twice.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the figure was 3.6 per cent, few people believe it will remain when the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank reports.
The increase in interest rates in this fragile economic regulation may be risky and raise the question of "if this time is different", said Deutsche Bank.
The market participants have been prepared to raise the central bank throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which will end on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, future trade anticipates only 25% probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950 all the increase cycles have so far occurred in the super cycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has passed its predecessive peaks very quickly after the recovery has started," says the report.
On the other hand, there has been an extraordinary slow recovery from a recession that has been the worst in the period of observation.
In today’s cycle, the central bank has expected to end the last recession more far from: the record has been 35 months, and now it is already the 74th month.
The fixed return has also been insecure while the market is waiting for the interest rate, and the model is somewhat similar to the findings made on capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its impact will be seen more quickly in the debt securities than in the shares.
The trend of the yields of debt securities appears to vary immediately in the case of the first increase/operation of the cycle.
At the end of the interest cycle, the return on debt securities will immediately fall," Deuche Bank said.
The Charles Schwab strategy believes that the interest increase will lead to a convergence of income from longer and shorter debt securities, thereby aligning the yield rate.
High-income bonds are often better produced in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about searching for profits," said Kathy Jones, analyst of the Schwab’s solid profits in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's demands.
"In addition to the decline in doll's strength and inflation expectations, there are several indications that the market has adapted to the prospects of stricter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is even greater, the credit margins have increased and the instability has increased - all these are characterised by the market when the central bank has tightened its line.
Generally, companies whose business activities are mainly located in the United States will win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt are less performing when a dollar value increase makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have to finance.
"The history shows that the 'great' shares are generally more profitable in the three months after the first interest rate," Goldman Sachs analysts said in their customer report.
Companies with strong turnover ignored low turnover after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares were more performing than low-quality companies. The first average was 4 (percent units) and the latter 3 (percent units).
The debt will be a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of variable interest rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside the stock exchange, consumers too have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in dollar value.
Suppliers can also gain more profits, even though experts disagree with how fast the impact feels.
The BBC Radio is a copy of the Classic FM, Congressman Andrew Bingham says
The Conservative Officer Andrew Bingham is accusing the channel of "defense"
He claims that its separation from a commercial competitor will become increasingly difficult.
In addition, he took the BBC Music Awards awards, saying that they were just following the British Awards Prizes.
Mr. Damien Collins, with the congressman, criticized The Voice, saying that it's not original.
BBC Radio 3 is "developing" to Classic FM, claiming the pressure of the production company to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
The Conservative Representative Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to have a "nationalist" content and that it was increasingly difficult to separate from a commercial competitor.
"I don't want to use the term "nationalism" to turn into a Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards Prize gala, which was launched last December.
"The last year BBC Music Awards appears to be a British Awards gala under different names.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that I remember directly when you actually copied something that you already found on the market," Bingham said.
The president of the BBC contested the allegations that BBC Radio 3 is much ahead of his commercial competitor as to live music and the sharing of information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classic music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to living music and music is, in fact, first class.
"In addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Previously this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must work more than before to reach the public because the British know less about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only part of the BBC supply criticised during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports to enter the tens of commercial competitors.
The Conservative Tory People's Representative Damien Collins criticised The Voice, a music competition that BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media estimated to be 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not in any way self-preservative?
Lord Hall argued that this BBC1 channel program, where Paloma Faith and Boy George are the stars, has been produced with "a special BBC style".
He added that he wanted the production company to "find success inside his own house" the next time it started the entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of the future periods of The Voice, or to order that the money of the pledges would be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales so far rose at least in August, Black Friday may be the reason for
Online sales grew by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month there was an increase after the beginning of the statistics in 2000.
Three years ago online sales were confirmed by the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November Black Friday might control consumption.
Virtual purchases have grown dramatically for over a decade, and many of the UK’s shopping streets have become haunted cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a level playing field in the air when the latest figures showed a rise of only 7% in the first quarter of 2015.
Overall consumption in August grew at least since the beginning of the statistics in 2000: only five per cent increases last year.
Experts say that there are indications of the level of net sales in the air when the latest figures showed a rise of only 7% in the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the growth levels of previous years and return to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rationalised over time," Andy Mulcahy, the supplier of the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phones for shopping.
It meant that more people made online shopping and that they could be made in different environments, such as the couch.
But now it balances, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday event from America has been seen as one of the reasons behind the slow stores.
Experts believe that consumers will control shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average average was five times the number of buyers scrubbed on their computers to pick up shops and put down the websites of many traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who made the buyers fight the discoveries, can control the purchases.
In a study published by British Retail Consortium, only about one pound of five was used online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made of online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of using fashion chains for shopping streets.
The Muslims bury Meca's deaths in a lifting accident, the Bin Laden family's consequences
The Muslims wore 29 dead bodies through the streets during the first funeral in Mekka
Saudi Arabia has been partially accused of the collapse of the building waste Saudi Binladi Group
The Ministry of Health also reported that 394 people were also injured when the lifting crane collapsed down.
29 the dead were carried in the air through the streets, and hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them; and the victims died, when the crucifix collapsed in Meca's great mosque.
Mostly white - dressed mourners filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their last trip to Al-Moaisem's cemetery.
The sad passion passed a holy place where only a few days ago the lifter fell through the mosque roof and knocked down the worshipers.
The bodies were released to be buried when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed the construction group of Bin Laden’s family for a catastrophe, in which 394 people were also injured.
The 29 bodies of the worshipers who had fallen in Meca’s great mosque were worn through streets
Among the dead, the father of four children was Qasim Akram from Bolton from Manchester, his first pilgrimage when the lifting crane collapsed.
Akram had been in a big mosque with his parents before the beginning of the yearly retreat.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the degradation of Mekka will continue when thousands of them continue to enter the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladi Group should not have left the lift up when it was not in use.
In the Arabic version of the decision published by Saudi Press Agency, the government ruled, the Binlad Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news service did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s directors are prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to survive, causing the fall of the lifting cranes to the yard of a large moslim, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before later this month.
The Binladis Group has not published any communications on the collapse of the dooms and its representatives have not been captured for comment.
The king’s decision also blamed the association for not using up-to-date protective measures and did not cooperate with meteorological authorities.
There are tens of lifting cranes around the big mosque of Meca, which are part of the enormous building robbery that the Binlad Group runs.
Binladin’s family has been close to Saudi Arabia’s ruler family for decades, leading to large construction projects.
Al-Qaida's deceased leader Osama bin Laden was a rebel son whose family refused in the 1990s.
The ruin occurred in wind and rainy weather only for days before millions arrive to the Kingdom for a pilgrimage, which must be done at least once in their lives by every capable Muslim.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials (174 000 pounds) to the loved ones of the dead and to those who were permanently injured.
The rest of the injured will get half of this amount.
The B&Q boss says that low-cost workers in Eastern Europe are behind popularity
The British increasingly use the services of assistants, says Veronica Laury.
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a consequence, 200 more Screwfix shops will be opened for professionals
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, the city's main correspondent for Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and paint pencils and to hire skilled Eastern European workers to make home house purchases
Looks like if you're clumsy with a hammer or you're going to paint walls, you're in a minority now.
You see, the British are increasingly hiring assistants to do tea-se-e-e-works in their homes, says the head of the company behind the B&Q.
The new CEO of Kingfisher owning the home repair chain, Veronica Laury, said that behind popularity, the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at the expense price.
This leads to the plans of Kingfisher to open 200 new trades for employees and to close 60 B&Q sales.
Laury said that she wanted more women to work for B&Q stores, because eight of the ten purchase decisions made in shops are precisely made by a more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the population need to be taken into account: today there are more single women's economies where more home renovations are made than before.
Laury said, "The majority of the staff of our stores are still men.
We need to get a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process."
Laury is only one of the five women leading the main companies of the British FTSE100 index, and he has rebuilt his management team with as many men and women in it.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group with equally 50 % of women, including its Director-General and the Financial Director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision... "the difference here is important.
It hasn't been hard to find good women in the board."
Kingfisher reported a fall in both profits and sales of six months after the group took the costs of closing the sales.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher owns Screwfix and B&Q stores is opening 200 new movements
The government of the three aces decided to use mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The apparent effects were made quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAC and other employees' centres began to force the country immediately, and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to the widespread demonstration of employees.
A lot of people think that there will also be reason.
Let's see if it's worth striking when it goes bad anyway.
Even the resistance has been established.
More than 50,000 people have already visited online to report that they are not going to participate in the expression of mind, but are going to work.
In an old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet to protest, but openly declared as a criminal would have been a political suicide of a small person.
Millions of trade unions, some ten thousand people's protests don't take much time, but it gives reason to think.
The position of the trade union is no longer as self-evident as yet, 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the Ay movement, the brutal solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift of the sky.
As things have seemed to roll with their own weight for years, the unions will finally have access to the matter, i.e. the rights of the worker, to defend, visibly and properly.
This may allow the government to imprison the role of the Ay movement when membership in the trade union is seen perhaps more necessary.
Whatever the organizations think of, it's stupid that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has already declined 31 months in success.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment is rising.
These things are supposed to force everyone's heads.
High savings for the University of Lappeenranta: targeting 8.5 million savings, reduction of staff by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranta starts a savings cube aimed at obtaining a total cut of costs of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start the whole of the staff consultations with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means a reduction of approximately 130 employees.
In addition, the aim is to save two million other activities.
The core negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates that the actual operation will be 8.5 million deficits.
It is also influenced by the government’s financial cuts.
In this financial year, the university will deliver about 2.6 million deficit results.
The cost will increase slightly for next year, but at the same time, the funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is approximately EUR 85 million, which means that the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between massive education and research cuts and the reduction in corporate funding to our university is very important, says principal Anneli Pauli in the university newsletter.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed to be even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears to be in new dimensions.
Negotiations with trust men will be launched on Tuesday next week and will last for the six weeks prescribed by the law.
Hole: Lucky wants for Finnish railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the biggest British rail transport companies, Souter says.
Rail transport is to be gradually opened to competition.
The first of these is close transport in the capital region in 2017-2018.
After close transport, there is a shift in district transport.
Souter says he's already approaching the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the plans of Lucky.
At least Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe, has announced its interest in other international companies in rail transport.
The US Central Bank has to make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world will follow the side when the Central Bank of the United States meets for the first time on Wednesday and Thursday, a critical decision on whether they raise interest rates for the first time to almost a decade.
When Mr Reuters carried out a survey to 80 economists, just over half of those who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates, they now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates are maintained at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is an historic event, since when the central bank cut the interest rates to zero, it is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a central central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero levels and start normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute, senior uplow.
The US economy has been relatively well, and recovery has brought billions of dollars to balance and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rose global visions.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for lifting, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20.00 (CET).
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology message.
After he shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning before he shot his colleague later on the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message that said he was a "good" about the first murder and hoped, "that you could cancel it," said the authorities on Tuesday.
Mississippin Gautier's police told me that the Delta State University teacher Lamb called 911 at about 10 a.m.
Monday, and he told me he'd shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send police officers to his house.
He said, "He killed his wife last night," and he also mentioned that there's a "like dog" in the house that "not bothering anyone," but he's probably upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't tell me that.
Lamb didn't explain the shooting.
When the police got there, they found the body of the 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a letter written by a 45-year-old Lamb, saying, "I'm so sorry that I could cancel it.
I loved Amy, and she was the only person who's ever loved me."
After writing a message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers of Delta Staten, where he killed historian Ethan Schmidt, before finally killed himself late on Monday when the police ranked him.
Principal William LaForge said that he knew there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "surely there was something in Lamb's mind."
On Tuesday, the authorities said that despite the allegations published on Monday that Lamb would have believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, there was no "length or evidence" of any "driemiodrama".
Shawn O'steen told me he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good man".
A couple broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'steen told me that she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was "shattered".
O'steen told me that Prentiss and his daughters were "the best friends of all of them."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online from his home. Sun Herald says he was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police told Lamb to call his relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them, "You're not going to jail."
When the police reached Lamb on highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there and went running into the forest where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education science in the spring of 2015 for Delta States, says the CV from the University website.
Stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), photograph of his son Redmond (right), has been hard in recent years.
In 2001 he was ill with leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to rumours, he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for the possession of drugs.
All such things really require their tax.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is out for months because of a double break.
Luke Shaw got a double break on his right foot in Manchester United when he lost PSV Eindhoven in the Champion League.
Although the defendant remained in tears and is outside for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw would still be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by the reckless tack of Hector Moreno at 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated at the field for 9 minutes, and he had to be given oxygen before taking him to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe one day after, and then we'll be in Manchester.
This is terrible, and the boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18 years old, suffers from trouble and then plays great, and this is what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he had a oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it'll take a double fracture at least six months, and he won't play at the block stage.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card and a punishment shot.
Nicola Rizzoli, the Specialist, didn't rang a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian actor was mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I tell you it's become a penalty shot and a red card.
It was really bad for two legs.
Shaw twitted as follows: "Thank you all for your messages, words aren't enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
The subject is: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses PSV.
An English defender has an additional incentive to recover next June's European Championships in France.
Coach Phillip Cocu of the PSV said, "It's a really bad injury."
If any player gets out for such a injury, they're all very sad.
The purpose of our players is never to offend the opponent.
Moreno's leg broke when he played in the Mexican team against Van Gaal Holland in the 2014 MM race.
"Moreno takes this hard because the aim is not to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing that I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's tack.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this could be.
I feel terrible about this. I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado, PSV, was also taken to the hospital after Chris Salmang was challenged.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until it learns almost from the outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday child care service asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children’s book, he chose Dr. Seuss’ Book The Lorax, a environmentally friendly story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "A fun, moving, creative and containing a strong message. I enjoyed reading this book for my children because it seems to always find a picture or message that we haven't seen before."
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, where Cameron is supposed to describe the book’s plot, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details were added to the relatively short original text.
"In the city of Tarille, which is inside the walls, where all nature has lost and even air is traded, Ted-boy hopes to win his dreams for the heart of a girl by filling Audrey's wish to see the right tree," the text says and describes a love story that Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, by the right name of Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds as if it was taken from the Lorax film compilation found on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins as follows: "In the city of Tarille within the Muri, where everything is artificial and even air is a commercial product, Ted boy wishes to win his dreams for the heart of a girl named Audrey."
In view of the fact that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unconscious to have been drinking a book. A young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has destroyed greed, wooden, and needed, Kerskanen, without sending the story of the short, fierce creature of Lorax, who “shes for the trees.”
This relatively invisible PR task is likely to be exhibited to an assistant who has apparently never read the book 20 times in succession for a child.
The Prime Minister's mediator said that the text must have come from the office of Cameron's constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron’s staff but did not comment further at that moment.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk to stay behind the British team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for a tour, I don't think it's likely that there will be a recurrence of the last 3-0 serial crash.
I wouldn't shut the host win out of the bills.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but it has good cruisers, and the team's thinking is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only young positive.
Moeen Ali evolves in its circular use and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, even though there is an unknown factor at this level.
It's about: Adam Lyth dropped from the British cricket team, and Alex Hales is in his place.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth from the team is understandably difficult to analyse me because I am his principal coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but cruel truth is that cricket players are criticised on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the notice, because, as I have said before, players are the best of choice.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
I hope if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The British head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't perform as well as he could, and that doesn't surprise me.
It's hard to answer the question how long a hitter can get a trace.
Lyth was elected seven times for the country team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Compton was the only one who got the chance to play at home and in strangers.
The only cause of the complaint is that England first chose Jonathan Trott to the Caribbean, when Lyth was in top condition, but that lost opportunity is now the past.
Alex Hales is coming with you, and there's a beater I appreciate.
He's a cricket player of something that we saw early in Yorkshire during this season when he did 236 points against us at Trent Bridge's field.
He must at least be given the same chance as the others before him, but this certainly depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen has been bolted in a hit-by-front with Cook, where there would be an extra feeder in the field, but there could be four quick ones, and I am not against it.
I don't understand why the puncher couldn't hit there, and this left-handed has already shown to be a pretty cricket player.
Moe did not necessarily do his job in his county in Worcestershire, but he is a threesome for them and there is no difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games when he fell to the first sleeve before he moved to the opening in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a thief, and the little I've been dealing with him, he seems to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his impregnable statistics, hitting the average 31, with the ball 35, and think it's gambling, but there's not too many feeders at hand, and the pickers chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few hard additions to the coach.
The appointment of a Sri Lankan hitter, Mkeke Jayawardene as a consultant in the games can prove to be a genius.
He is one of the most comfortable guys in the game and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes into the games of the white ball, bringing both energy and a pathetic distraction.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, it was gambling or training, and he's got the same useable fools as Mkee.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested in one day, and Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, the coaches and the chosen ones do not make timetables.
And you must remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on light grounds.
Britannia's departure from the EU (Brex) can lead to victory if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's semi-white renegotiation strategies in order to keep Britain in the EU are facing ever greater problems every day, even though it would not be taken into account by the hearty Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn's choice to lead the Labour Party or the oppression of the union of trade unions on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Faragne.
A European diplomatic partner recently explained that, since the EU is so deep in so different crises, which are not all of its own, some Member States are tired of the British self-centered agenda, full of differentiated concessions and disrupting contractual changes that these countries mostly do not want.
At his annual meeting in Brighton, the central union of trade unions decided not to want them, even if they degrade social protection.
We could call it Dave and George the Selfieagent.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument with or without a local eyewitness, and then coming home, saying that they will win supporters for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look out outwards inside the British EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," from Berlin says that the shortest ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point that they won't care about us then we leave.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but he has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave his action before it goes down the same way as it took too long to stay with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland has a re-selection or replacement in 2017.
He's also a departing force.
Poland may soon have a national government of the right, Spain is a left-handed.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice themselves for the self-ebrites, when their energy would rather be targeted to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it because of similar separatist trends.
So, my friend presents, some of these ministers can even deliberately plan to make useless comments in the style of the Scottish National Party during the UK referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Brext process.
"The renegotiation was organised" and "The negotiations had nothing to do with Britain."
The Europeans have been keenly experienced how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how the EU-sceptic press solitaires are, what they were not inspired by Tony Benn during the 1975 referendum, when our membership started in 1973 was confirmed by ratio 2:1.
They can indefinitely remember Boris Johnson, the largest European opportunist, who named himself by writing "EU direct bananas" as a Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a record of a number of tax-exempt strangers, a number of outsiders who hack phones, and persons who have their registered residence elsewhere and who own most of our large newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought about them exactly the same way, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a lustful gorilla, you're gonna have to give up the bananas for a scam unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later another dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blamier than Blair himself, as regards the opposition to the renegotiation of Cameron, and Bair had agreed to the principle behind the rejected Constitution of the EU, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, giving Blair an exit.
The press never forgived him, either.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me at the Westminster House on Monday (I told him that he had no more time to waste on me), would be at risk to re-enter Neil Kinnock's 80s by boycotting the Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake at that time and now.
Even though it can take time, however, he has to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not with me, but with no doubt Andrew Marri, who left from the BBC-Soft Corby on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn in Europe is, in beautiful terms, evolving.
He says that he would like us to stay in the reformed EU.
Well, the majority of people outside the military paintings of the UK independence Party, Ukipi, and the most vicious nationalists of the Conservative Party, can certainly be behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fan" Benn said this both on the radio and on TV this week, when his internal patrol would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to nominate a cosmetic John McDonnell shadow government's financial minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his father was struggling on TV, trying to be disloyal to his colleagues of the Labour Party without going so far, however, to lose his place of government.
Hilary's coatings were more attractive.
But the fight for being involved in "in any situation" Benn's irrationalness was not what McDonnell said, and the conclusion that Corby told the heads and referenda at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the im hierarchical, emotional and personal image Corby wants to convey (remember that she even touched me), the disciplinaryness of communication is important during the 24-hour TV period, and in particular in social media faints, which is acceptable for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to consider the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign as obvious.
Simon Jenkins at least thinks so.
However, the fundamental circulation of McDonnel and Corbyn in relation to EU membership (and, in line with their mentally regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer a difficult debate with left-wing entrants for whom narcissism of small differences is central to the opilisation of dogmia.
As far as his double-range relationship with NATO is concerned (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby was not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they have suspicious voters) to grants to Britain when it can be completely vain?
The United States has already been disappointed by the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the presence of the cost-raising Conservative Government, as reminded me of the initiative of the British Influenza Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise Public Health England's Electric tobacco assessment
Researchers have said that the State-funded agency claimed that electric tobacco was 95% less harmful than traditional, that it had the beginning of a meeting of 12 people in which some had contacts with the tobacco industry.
Experts at the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed with the evidence used by the critics of Lancet Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electric tobacco.
In the last month, PHE published this 'virtancy plough' report, taking pictures of it as a "covered review of the evidence".
However, a number of researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical academy release Lancet published a main article last month, which attacked Phe's headline decision on "experienced huteral base".
Two other researchers in BMJ have been wondering if the claims were " built on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, Simon Capewell, say: "The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that PHE's claim "the best estimate is that electric tobacco is about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people, which developed a multi-criterium decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthetise their opinions on the disadvantages associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, whose director-general said had previously received funding from Bristic American Tobacco for independent investigations.
He also supported the BAT public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people in the meeting reported that they had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding that he said had previously received from Philip Morris International.
The criteria for the selection of the members of the panel are not indicated, but the panel includes a number of well-known producers of electric tobacco, some of which also indicate that they have received funding from the sector.
Others on the ground are not known for their expertise in the control of tobacco.
The president of PHE also attended the meeting.
The study produced by the group "increasingly admits that there is a lack of "controversial evidence about the damage to most products and most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell writes.
However, no of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say that there is no evidence that electric tobacco operates as a route for smoking in children or non-smokers.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of PHE’s health and well-being, says that the claims in BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Smoke bags are considerably less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who burn their lives die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electric tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public intelligence in relation to relative dangers.
Almost 80 000 people die annually from smoking-related illness, and the NHS pays 2 billion pounds a year.
By exploring the current evidence, which means that even though electric tobacco is not risk-free, their harm is just a fraction of the effects of traditional tobacco, we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 Director.
Luke Johnson, former Channel 4 president, has said that BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" for the slow ones such as this soap series in Albert Square Street.
Johnson said that the licence fees should only be used to produce programmes that are not made by other British broadcasters.
He criticises BBC that it puts public service programmes that are likely to have a smaller public, against the most competitive programs seen by competitors in difficult mission times and for channels such as BBC4.
After the president of the BBC, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he had come to Channel 4 for six years in time to create a relationship with the BBC for nothing.
"I do not understand the idea that BBC would produce and send programmes that would be clearly compatible with unsubventional competitors," Johnson said to the Committee on Communications in the Upper Room as part of its research on the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is maintained - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this communication or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do and do not.
The Voice is sent to the most important broadcasting time, as it is intended to collect as much support as possible to its future.
The idea of no one else to show the program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without State aid.
The Voice is one of those and EastEnders the other, no doubt within the house.
To be honest, other channels would give anything to it.
I don't understand how this is about the delivery of public service.
I don't think that would weaken BBC at all."
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, leading Channel 4 in 2004-2010, said that the BBC is guilty of hunting the number of viewers 'for the purposes of the people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support'.
His comment on the BBC's most popular series is similar to the comments from Tony Ball, former director of Sky. He used his Mac Taggart class in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that BBC sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that BBC's smaller public public public service programs "go to BBC4, which often cannot be measured, but the BBC thus meets its responsibility and then can, in defending the licensing income of 4 billion pounds of vouchers, say, "I am sure, we are doing all these unknown programmes, which no one sees."
They put them on a missionary place where no one will ever come to see them.
On the permit fee Johnson said to the Committee, "I want you to find a more regressive system in who gets the most value.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year will get a lot of value, but I don't know if it's true for people who have 150 pounds of money because they don't use much BBC.
David Elstein, former director of Sky and Channel 5, who also proved to the Committee on Tuesdays, said that the BBC should reassess its re-estimation of the task of Reith's time "to inform, train and entertain".
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as training - he said the figures are 1 % of TV production and 0.1 % of the radio - and that it should take a model of Australian and Canada's broadcasting broadcasts and change the function into "inform, educate and entertain".
With regard to partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events like Proms concerts, which, according to him, are shown on television only some, and alliance with commercial companies so that all of them can be viewed online.
"Agentics" allows brain cell control through sound waves.
The video shows how shuttles change directions as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Researchers have raised worms with genetically modified nervous systems so that they can be controlled by sound waves.
Small-headed shuttleworms are changing directions as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high to be heard by the human ear.
The impulses work by connecting genetically modified motion nerve cells with membranes that react to ultrasound levels.
Subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that worms show the performance of a new method called sound genetics. It uses ultrasound to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher of the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that one day the method could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive measure that leads electrical impulses to human brains in order to deal with Parkinson’s disease.
Succubeworms normally do not react to ultrasounds, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles reinforced ultrasound waves that then pass into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves affect the TRP-4-ionic openings, structures in the cellular membranes of some worms.
The sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the attached cells, reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to produce ultrasound-controlled shuttle lands, Chalasani transformed worms genetically so that part of their business nerve cells are TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound for modified mattresses, microcupods reinforced the sound waves and conveyed them to the mats where they connect on the transformed business nerve cells.
The process has some of the same features as optogenetics, a utilizing tool that allows scientists to connect nerve cells on and off by using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics can have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike light that has to be sent from optical fibre to the desired place inside the brain, low-speed ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unavoidably, so they can be sent to the brain from the head of the brain.
"We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic virus it may be possible to allow the target human nervous cells to react immediately to ultrasound signals in certain neurologic treatments in the clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
Advertising is a shame for British arms trade
Look at the video on Amnesty International's anti-speed.
Horrible killer machines!
Smashing ankles!
Fruit bombs!
And electronic pumps that cause painful pain, but do not leave traces!
The joyous voice and the cartoon image language do not leave any doubt that this world’s largest stationary fair is a sharp barode produced by Amnesty International in order to highlight the British government’s willingness to trade weapons for oppression governments at the ExCeL Centre in the London Shipyard.
Subject: DSEI stations: authoritarian administrations arrive in London
As a result of a separate campaign, a number of posters also appeared on bus stops and metro-jun, demanding a more accurate understanding.
" Important information, are you travelling on the DLR route on September 15-18?" one of them is asked using the London underground font and brand, as the track of DLR becomes a picture of the tank.
In September, a bunch of arms dealers will arrive on the DLR route... and customers will be asked to help stop the stations.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose work was presented at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Public Plans).
A collector named Special Patrol Group helped spread posters all over London using the Ad Space Hack Packs packages. It consists of six-pound packing keys, which, according to the collective, "access to a third of the commercial space of bus tanks on the planet".
Transport for London has not been entertained by this unauthorized "posterial vandalism".
One of the barodie commercials produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and the University of Essex newspaper Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to outside the gallerys.
Many artists have started working with activists in resistance fronts when they realize that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-arm trade poster greets business travellers in the metro.
Amnesty's video has been viewed on Facebook over the last 24 hours more than 100 000 times. It was created free by VCCP, and also by the graphic designer and background reporter worked for free.
VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, found that the stations weren't advertised at all, and the ExCeL calendar was empty at the time and thought, "We'll give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the idea of a more realistic advertising of vague corporation, but "was more stopping the issue with bright colors and animations".
"They have done fantastic work to help us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
Now the UK government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art with regard to the stations comes from the inside of ExCeL, when the actors trade fantastic decorated products.
It is revealed in his press release that he received a order from the U.S. Army on the AT4CS RS launching his shoulder.
This includes "a unique plumbing box that focuses excellent effects on the back of the tank within the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student home
It's been 11 years since I unconsciously moved into a student home, and then I still believed in the barets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the crowded smiles of people I irritated and the numerous, long complaints of others.
A large part of what I learn can be summarised in eight simple rules.
Changing into the apartment can be anything from the nerves to the scary.
It's annoying to tell me where you're from and where you're thinking about Corby, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite, because it's really just a bit of shiny to find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to breathe, ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and not those you don't want to talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they'd share the shutters.
Give the people room.
People’s rooms are often transformed into cocktail invitations, pets and luxurious leisures, but they are also the places where people dress and fix their underwear.
Subject: Do not even imagine starting a university when you are in a relationship
University is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many apartments form a culture of traveling from room to room, which is friendly, social, and causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but you have to leave now so I can collect back the energy I spent talking with you."
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing and maybe send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
Knocking when the speech came up, knock.
A guy in my student home thought that if the door wasn't locked, he had been invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends through baking.
Because you're starting the university in the peak of baking trends, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate cupboard and introducing yourself seems to some extent less strange, less "become in the neighborhood, I've made you something, now smile when I ask you some personal questions" from a 50-century.
Offering self-worked delicious things is a great way to make friends.
Your living mates are obligated to talk, and it may be that they will in the future link your face to a tasty surprise.
Of course, it depends on how to bake.
Badly mixed flour sugar-fat tables are likely to make people pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, taking some chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk on your tea?
Ask and check the milk owner.
It's possible that they give you permission even though they're boiling inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to take it more adult than my homeboat, who mixed his milk with washing stuff to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You don't have to make noise so people can't sleep or learn.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that parable of a proverb that rings the boiler.
In my hall, the girl asked her neighbor if they could play their drama and bass music slowly because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had a exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally shut down at 5:00 a.m., the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before she put her own music on, locked her door and went to a three - hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse ever moved to the same apartment with you?
Or in turn, would it not be incredibly uncomfortable if you thought that your partner would be your future partner, you would come together, break up, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your common friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot cottage partner really is not your future mate, you could even try to talk to your bottom.
In that cheerful moment, when you find that someone has left his keys in an unlocked room, the limit between the buffalo and the harassment is thiner than it seems.
Well, it's fun, but it's cancelable in a moment.
You can give me a useful and fun lesson in safety by hiding something, but never mess up someone's room with a toothpaste and champagne.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, then you put them in a freezer, but don't stick their assets to the ceiling on the blue terrace like at least twice.
A racist attack on the home of foreign students at Kite - a house designed for reception centre was strangled in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack on Kite in North Karelia was carried out at the foreign students' home.
Unlike the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation facilities of minor asylum seekers, but the bedrooms of foreign students who have been in Finland for longer time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher of Kiteen Evangeline Public School.
The windows and walls of the faculty of accommodation facilities were strangled with racist signs, such as razorists, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one accommodation facility, says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, as a responsible teacher of the social guarantee education of young people at the National University, there were estimated ten people at the time of the attack in the building that was vicious.
"It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some could have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
The National University has accommodationd people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All the people in the contaminated building have a status.
Parts study in adult basic schools, part in professional studies, and part study Finnish," Luukkainen says.
The ‘A’ status is a so-called permanent residence permit, which can be issued for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The East Finland police are investigating the attack as damage and a violation of the domestic peace.
According to Luukkain, a press conference was held for students on Monday, including the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had 20 years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens," Luukkainen says.
I'm telling you, the messengers have already been cleaned out of the walls.
As a suspect, there were at least three men and they had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the head of the youth weekend when this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luukkainen says.
Salo has also been drilled to a hospital where a reception centre has been designed.
The case happened last week.
This was reported on the MTV website on Tuesday night.
The wall of the hospital was carved and written in English "You are notwelcome".
We've got a criminal report on this case.
Revision 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected malfunctional data provided by the police about the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will abolish the Y-jun for Karjaa, the passengers in their asses, the "she's an idiot's country"
The Y-train from Helsinki to the Karjaa of Rasepor ceases to travel in March.
The news insulted passengers on the Helsinki main railway station from the beginning of the train in the beginning of the afternoon.
In particular, the sweep hits the wings, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's just an idiot, because the number of inhabitants is growing all the time, and those who work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be up to anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says HSTV's interview video is going to the main city on a tractor.
Train changes also take place elsewhere in New Zealand.
The H and R trains on the main path are combined with a new R line.
Purola's position in Lake Head and Punch City in Tususula remain out of service.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes from which the Ministry purchases train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period is changing in year-to-year and the routes to be terminated are in the country as a whole.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will later be adopted by the Monetary Committee.
The Siuntian Bengtström believes that the state train cutter is a short-looking operation.
We make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and are repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there'll be regret.
Y trains are also used by others, not only by Raaseporians and Zionians, because it is fast and crosses multiple stations.
Annina Pöyry, from Espoo, was deeply affected by the destiny of travellers on the train to the city area.
"It's very bad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said when he was in pain on the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
There is probably a new train connection to the beach, which will replace the Y-juna in the region of the Region of Helsinki (HSL), i.e. leading to the Church.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately assess the costs.
Rihtniemi says that HSL has paid the Y train about a million years, based on the number of passengers, the Ministry certainly paid much more than that.
The R-line on the main track leaves two stations.
Instead, in Ainola and Saunakallio, the number of train ranks is doubled.
A total of 28 small stations and a number of routes end from the whole country.
The Ministry is no longer buying train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki- Wallfahrt.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to the route Pieksämäki-Varkus.
Train ranks are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaan-Oulu.
More than half a million travels per year are made in late shifts, with around nine million travels purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring savings of 12.3 million annually to the State.
The value of the agreement is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the Book "The Modernity of Capital" "You should learn about Marx"
World economic crises have raised Karl Marx (1818-1883) and, in his 1867-1894 conclusion, writes the actuality of Marx's capital, known as former president of the GDP, in the book Yrj Hakanen published today.
"He's being taken more seriously than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his predecessor.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, the internationalisation and infiltration in all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money and imaginary capital have proved to be surprisingly far-reaching.
The book writer list organised by Hakase also provides a professor at Aalto University, a highly respected economic operator Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes Marx is a topical "new and forever".
But isn't the former Managing Director of the Research Institute for Business and Business delegation Marxian?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not consider Marx a topical economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theory.
Nowadays, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary lessons.
"The usual idea is that the history of the atheist tells the wrong opinions of the dead men," Korkman starts.
It's true that Marx's prophecies went very wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he draws too far from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman is considering.
But Korkman sees the value of the radical positioning of Marx.
"The more relevant in Marx is that she asked some good questions," she says.
We are discussing again Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of a technical turbulence," Korkman analysis.
But what the government should decide tomorrow isn't helping Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Still, it's worth getting familiar with Marx.
"In the '70s Marx couldn't read," says Korkman.
"The Maoris and the Troths and the other secs hated all capitalism, but even more each other."
Today the debate is more versatile and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political mass load of the years back.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like other classics," Korkman says.
United Nations demands war criminals in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the Sri Lanka Civil War, reports by the AFP.
The UN report on the Civil War in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames war crimes on both the Sri Lankan Armed Forces and Rebels known as Tamil Tigers.
In the Sri Lanka Civil War, at least 100 000 people are estimated to die.
Even the number of victims is unknown.
In particular, in the last months of the long-term war, the major attack of the armed forces should be properly investigated, and the UN report requires.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report blames for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which were as likely victims as men and women.
According to the report, the rebels are guilty of forced bysiders and children to fight fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but is not going to allow the establishment of the United Nations Court of Justice because of foreign judges.
In England's yo's experiment, the social media was weighed
On Wednesday, a long foreign language, most of which had English, was on Wednesday.
England's skills were tested for over 16,000 experiments.
The experiment could have written a substance on social media.
On the basis of our own experience, it was necessary to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of the 150-250 words in English could point to the advisor of the web magazine.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is the Finnish Legia rest chair.
He had to be asked how his parents should look at things for young people too.
There were four subjects of the substance, one of which had to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them," estimates the third topic of Porvoo's Swedish-language high school, Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was only a citaat from the former President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso.
And the fourth subject, Lybeck, said it was pretty nice.
There was to be a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"In our school, we've always been practicing the writing of speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment as normal.
In the Finnish - or Swedish - experiment, English could answer the questions of texts, such as adaptation to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles continue on Friday, which is the next test of another domestic, Swedish, or Finnish, or Finnish.
The test is normally organised in the upper secondary schools, meaning that it is not affected by the demonstration of employees.
The college board invites students to find appropriate travel connections in due time so that they can get to the test event.
If you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence, you may also get more time.
The store was robbed with a gun in Oulu.
In Oulu, on Wednesday morning, the store was robbed in the clock district.
According to the police, the robber had been dressed with dark clothes and a face-covered commando.
The man is normal and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened his staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money to capture.
They're investigating it as a dirty robbery.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of demonstrators in Helsinki - support teams from elsewhere in Finland
The protesting expression of mind against the decisions of the Board of Directors will stop the center of Helsinki on Friday, predicting the police.
Preliminary information indicates that there are up to tens of thousands of people.
The members of the SAK, Aka and STTK alliance will meet at the Railway Envoy at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration of mind.
In turn, the police at work are not only responsible for carrying out the alerts and other police activities, but also for ensuring the smooth functioning of the giant expression.
Roads leading to the railway station are closed from motor vehicles for the period from 9.30 to 14.
All we have to do is get the alarm vehicles in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the edge of the Caesaniemi traffic circle, from the west direction of the Mannerheim.
Is it enough for people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand on the police's work fights.
According to Kujala, Helsinki is on its way from other countries in Finland because of the expression of mind.
The police won't tell us the exact patrol officer.
"There's a little coming, but we're usually gonna be fine with ourselves," Kujala says.
Police urges to avoid private caring in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst transport radius extends from the level of Hakaniemi to the nuclear center.
Standing traffic is expected from morning to morning.
With protesters from elsewhere in Finland, Helsinki will also have a lot of order buses.
They won't be allowed to the Railway Envoy.
Buses are basically out of time.
The rest of the trip, then we have to walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The spirit expression also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the point of view of the police, this is a positive side.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at hand at these large gatherings of people, is now dealt with in part by itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that Helsinki may become tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policies.
The police are expecting the expression of mind to go smoothly.
People are ordinary or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, the Finnish people are rational and peaceful," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also held on Friday in Finland.
Friday's expression of mind is in many ways extraordinary. Do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The great expression of mind organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, it does not find a very good comparison in Finnish political history, says Emeritus Martti Sizilien, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's not a miracle that the Ay business protested.
If it didn't do that, it would raise hands in front of the government, the Sheilan says.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the Finnish tradition of corporateism, including those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard shots are missing in the contract law.
There are a lot of features that ay-business is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement has a place to look at the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees to the minds of Friday.
The new is now the sharp division of which the expression of mind produces among those whose Ay-business would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from all over Finland showed their minds in the parliamentary house in November 1993.
If we are looking for a reference point for Friday’s demonstration, it could be an unemployed giant applause, the Murrostorstai held in 1993, the Sicily says.
In the middle of the deepest lama, the Murrostorstai gathered a total of 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (Central) government was disrupted from the labour market crisis to the other.
It was said that the Finnish government and the employees' organisations were never as bad as they were in the past during the Aho national government.
Now the government and the Ay-business are probably even worse than in Murrostorsta's time.
Besides, now Finland's very own government is ever in power, Sicily says.
The current coalition of government is still so interesting that it is so strictly right-wing, despite the speeches of the main Finns.
There were certain elements of the old workforce at the time of the steep.
A number of thousands of demonstrators are expected to be present on Friday.
Fascination also stops public transport and possibly closes day care and schools.
Although the expression of mind does not receive undistributed support for employees, it can become the largest for years.
In Helsinki, some 300 demonstrations have been organised annually in recent years.
There's a lot of them from the top to the bottom.
Traditionally, the Finnish Ay movement demonstrations have been quite peaceful, even though the practices have been tightened over the last few years.
Traditionally, a Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is lawful.
The speakers are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Sicily.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of interest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on them.
The strike of firemen lasted three months in 1998.
Among other things, the pilots and air traffic controllers had visible strikes.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical lakes in the 1970s
The most important strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men were involved in the metal men's strike.
The strike was suspended on a proposal from the Conciliation Board after seven weeks.
Metal men received a raise of 16%.
In the spring of 1977, the electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused electricity decay throughout the country.
Breakdown in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20 000 people, many unemployed in the lama, gathered to express their views on the job.
Firemen stabbed three months in 1998
The firemen's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
In 1994, the police faced eggs in the protests of farmers against the EU.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," one of the words of the attack.
For Espa, the farmers sniffed tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU summit in 1999 also allowed farmers to protest and burn haystacks in front of the meeting.
Nurses stabbed 1983 and 1995
For about a month, in 1995, the nurses stabbed.
For the last time, they had been in a strike in 1983.
In 1995 the strike was painted by a few deaths during the strike.
It threatened by the strike and the massacres of the nurses in 2007.
The threat of massacre has eventually accelerated the negotiations.
Doctors stabbed 2001
"Doctors in the strike - by the force," was one of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted for five months and resulted in an intense debate on how strikes could jeopardise patient safety.
After the lay, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students moving in 2013
Approximately 5 000 students marched for study support from Senatetor in Helsinki to the parliamentary house in 2013.
Central Crime Police to explore the background of a Finnish trunk full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for assistance in identifying the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It doesn't know if the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
They were all in good condition on the cold truck.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Research and main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, reports Captain Tero Haapala of Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in a truck in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on the ride were apparently strangled.
According to the public radio, the car belongs to the Finnish stock company, which first told the Austrian police about its cooperation.
The company, among other things, is conducting restaurant activities and its CEO is a foreign man, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqisists have been arrested for trafficking in human beings.
The ex-husband captain, the ex-drugs criminal, and a squirrely businessman, the story of five smugglers.
A luxurious smuggler king, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a cab driver who thinks he is a good guy.
For example, such people carry out human secret transport into the European Union.
Criminalist Andrea Di Nicola at Trento University and journalist Giampaolo Musumec have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "clients", and their written book The Travel Office of Death will appear in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the hulls of human trafficking, present solutions and present smugglers from different ports in business.
HS will present five of them.
I'm gonna beat them out of their minds right now.
The Quarter Islands in the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading to the summer.
For their location, the islands are also excellently suited to smuggling, as the journey to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 km.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is approximately 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-fired captain and the father of six children.
The multitude islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fisherman is more profitable to carry people.
That's what Emir has done on a blue, ten-metre tree boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, 40 people can fit.
From one trip, Emir will earn around EUR 8 000 after the cost.
Emir's got five assistants looking for his clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape confusion during the Arabian time.
Then the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis retreated.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as you can see it.
The food is given so that the customers are just and just survived.
The accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer loses the money, that is their problem.
They're going to the water at midnight with an off-white light.
The first night we drive off the islands, then stop, wait the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes seafare is hard, and in waves of 20 metres, passengers cry and puke.
At the end of the day, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour, and Emir is leaving for a return trip.
Emir wants to be scared.
That's why he fucks up his clients, and at least he says he's gonna beat the sounders to death.
He says in the book that once a cop knocked him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I took one of my clients in one neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The quietest passengers are coming south of the Sahara.
He said he'd have to abuse this.
I'm gonna beat them out of their minds right now.
We have to show them who's in charge.
It's just a regular cab driver.
Goran's a regular cab driver in Boskovaša in Serbia.
His cab isn't very good... the starter engine is pulling his last, and he's seen his best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the cab is moving and moving towards the Hungarian border.
Boskovasha is a small village with 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers south of Belgrade.
Behind the village is a centre for asylum seekers, which is mainly accessible to families.
In the forests around the centre, men traveling without their family will be accommodated in tents, crates and abandoned cars, which now has been able to find or build.
Families living in the woods who have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia for a reason or another.
Some also stay in private housing, but it is a public secret.
Goran finds most of his customers in the forest.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of crossing borders and weeks of walking in difficult landscapes, often mountain areas and darkness.
At the end of the day, when they arrive in the Bovosha area, at the knot of large human beings, people are fatigue.
The Goran Cypriots are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say it once, and that's enough," Gora congratulates.
He says the Africans are trying to sting.
Goran doesn't like it.
You stupid fool on the whole trip.
At first, a price of EUR 300 will be agreed, for example, and then they will count it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran stresses that he's a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says that he is working cheaper than others and he only pays 50 euros per person on the Hungarian border.
There's a trip of three hundred miles, most of the highways are nicely.
I hear the colleagues are asking for a three- or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about €50,000 a year.
It's not a big sum for a smuggler, but it's a very nice yearly income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not be transported 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his rider a mile from the border.
Then he'll show his clients the right direction and get away.
In the work of charitability
The 35-year-old congolism is called the Embassy Prisoner, and it's not just a favourite name.
He really has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, where many believers who escaped from Congo, and a small center helping Congolese children.
In addition to preaching, the Embassy minister runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees that he is doing the work of mercy.
It's important to look good for ambassador.
He polishs his shoes several times a day and ensures that the rubber of white underneath the low belt of jeans is stylishly cured.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his terrace car and his three motorcycles.
When the missionaries do not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the client calls some of the five phone numbers of the Consignee.
He advises you to arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money in your fist, and smash in between the merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain asylum seeker or refugee status to the Uganda authorities, it is necessary to inform the authorities that they are from, for example, the war zones of North Kivu and that they have been forced to flee violence from their homes.
Often it is true, but if not, the Consignor will arrange a new identity for the client.
An old identity card will be destroyed and a second one will be replaced.
That's where the Consignor's contacts at Uganda's police are helping.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers are going: the asylum procedure, NGOs, finally the UN Refugee Organisation UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has become a refuge in Uganda.
He pays separately from each port: the application to the Uganda police costs about EUR 100, the management of documents to the humanitarian organisation around 150 and the migration process, for example, EUR 4 500 to 7 000 in a European country.
Folio and iceberries
Tom's an initiating smuggler, a former drug criminal.
A four-year-old Irish guard on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people on their way to Britain.
He helps with Afghanistan, a French cab driver and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know that they are in a human undercover transport business in London.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, from one of those near Calais Center.
They're driving the A26 highway and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stop the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years because of the drugs.
The cab stops, Tom and his clients run across the highway to the rest site where the drivers sleep before they continue to cross the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck... to make sure it's just on its way to England and not even to the Netherlands... and cut off a security guard.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's involved in the plan, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client into a aluminium foil, similar to the one wrapped in the kitchen around a buffet or a furnace.
It should stop the police's thermal scanner from detecting a hidden person.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place in the hope that he won't drive a sudden sniper before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Mummer Küçuk is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
The Upporitic Turks have been called marketing master and the unquestionable king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, governing maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, Küçuk has been working and has constantly developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has one competitive advantage in relation to other entrepreneurs: he demands the money only.
One of the new methods is luxurious: the Turkish ports are rented with a view to taking the American or European families for a few days of tourist rites.
In fact, ships will be loaded to a full-scale Syrian, Iraqi, Kurdish and Afghanistan, which will be transported against a payment of EUR 5 000 to 7 000, first from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe.
Customers will be kept in human storage, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People go to minibuss and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, we need to get on board quickly.
Passengers have to stay hidden all the way under cover.
The Marine Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of the human population.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers exhale and puke, the better.
Küçuk receives about EUR 53 000 from one luxury ship trip after costs.
He does not do practical things himself, but hire the captains, recruiters, guards, accommodations and other smaller agents to do the work for him.
During the summer, at least hundreds of transport will be carried out and Küçük earns millions.
He's supposed to buy undercovers through land, pharmaceutical business, and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Mummer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and one of the pharmaceutical entrepreneurs.
Since then, apparently, he's gone.

American Olympiad drinks tell us in their book about their illness and becoming a prostitute
The new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1 500 - meter runner in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton tells in his book Fast Girl about quitting his career and becoming a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career in Sydney's Olympics.
He came to the races at the top and ran out of the quarantine for the second best time.
But in the final, he was panicked.
At first he ran to the top and defended his leading position with a manic run.
But 150 metres before the goal, his power was exhausted.
He collapsed on the track surface, and the other competitors passed him one after the other.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
But I pushed myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later, it became apparent that Favor Hamilton was suffering from a bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before Sydney’s races, and he himself felt great prosperity.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when he became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
No financial problems in the barbecue, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with strange men.
He also overpaid his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury life.
One explanation by Favor Hamilton to become a prostitute was that he needed the same adrenaline spikes he had been competing with in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out he had a bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former astronomer appeared at the end of 2012 when the Smoking Gun published an article on him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was at 1,500 metres of world statistics at 3.57.40, but remained the last in the Sydney Olympic Final.
The world champion was delighted when the alliance put Norway's ski flower under control: "Shortbacks"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of fitness, in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and Norway's Shipping Union have evacuated the whole summer and autumn, like last year, from a sports agreement.
Although the covenant has offered Northug a better deal than other sportsmen, it has not been good enough for the world champion and Olympic winner.
As a result of the agreement, the Norwegian Shipping Union decided to close Northug out of the world cup of the coming season.
The decision was made by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put the ski flower under control.
"Thank you for showing the backbone," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow an active athlete to avoid working in favour of a alliance sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian skiing Union and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously like to be part of a seasonal country team so that he could advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said that he was happy to represent a union that also cares for future generations and does not give one athlete in the salts.
At the same time, he recalled that the covenant has given Northug both financial and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb doesn't accept that one athlete has different rules than just because he's the best.
Northug published his own release on Tuesday, in which he assured him that he would like to be brave in Norwegian colors next season in the world cup as well as after that in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MMs, two of them golden.
Last winter in Falun, he was involved in a team that won the message gold.
The turtle day of the translators is also spent in the northern country.
On Turtle Day 25.9, we are hosting concerts in different restaurants and shops for which the Shrink translators' shield has been awarded.
The goal of the day is to highlight the high level of food expertise in Finland and lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of the high quality.
At the same time, it is worth reminding that all high-level restaurants have not concentrated on the capital area, but the top restaurants checked and classified by a neutral operator are located throughout Finland.
The international attention received by the event is evidence of the importance of the event as part of increasing the sensitivity of turtle restaurants and organizations.
The day in the northern country is held in Vaasa at the Foundation and Kantarelli.
At Kokkola, a restaurant in the Old Town is taking part in a turtle day.
The event has also received considerable international attention.
It is therefore decided to make the organisation one of the most important international events that will be held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-joki Magazine: The Chancellor of Justice appelled for the establishment of a Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up the LSK Business Park Oy, which is currently owned by the Kauhava Ex-Arrangement.
According to the complaint, the region remains permanently located in critical infrastructure in crisis times, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, the Finnish Erillis Networks Oy.
According to the Drugjoki magazine, the private person believes that the placement of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interest in the region and airport of the former Air War School, whose impact has also not been established in the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case states that in the last two years there have been negotiations on the organisation of air training and the outcome of a potential foreign operator on the airport.
This was discussed among other things by Minister of Defence, Jussi Niniston (ps.) and by Mr Arto Rädy, Head of State of Defence.
The private person notes to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a question of objection to the reception centre in principle, but of the fact that the planned place in the former garrison area is wrong.
The horrific city government dealt with the reception center last Monday.
Ninja: The situation in Syria reflects Ukraine and the Baltic Sea
The management means that there are the necessary conditions for immigrants and those who are here, Niinistu commented to the journalists in the evening after meeting the presidents of all parliamentary parties with their offices in Mäntyniem.
According to the president, the concern about managing the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland, the government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
The situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region, could also have an impact on the situation of Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
Solution is hopeful of the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction that is capable of the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension of the Baltic Sea.
The NATO question was also ignored in the debates.
The President did not take a position on the situation on the labour market.
Finnair pours on Friday 16 domestic flights, Aleks close for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 Fridays.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia has been reported that the operations of the airports are being carried out by the commander during the occupation.

Fame closes the streets of the centre of Helsinki
The demonstration held on Friday closes the streets of the centre of Helsinki.
The police tell us that the streets leading to the Railway Station are closed from the cars around 9:30-14.
From the direction of the Mannerheims, cars are not allowed to go to Kaivokatu, Postkatu or the Gulf Street to the railway station.
From the Union’s street of Hakanieme, transport will be directed to the Union’s street at the Caesaniemi traffic circle.
According to the police, the closure time depends on the population involved in the demonstration.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed to enter the area.
Metro and cruise drivers throughout Friday's mind manifestation
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of the morning traffic to the end of night transport.
The Radiation and Metro staff Association told the STT this evening.
The majority of the primitives are closed for two hours, including posts closed
Friday's expression of mind also causes disruption of Post's services.
Significant delays are expected, among other things, for the distribution of daily mail.
Most of the postal service points are closed.
The blood transportation of the Finnish Red Cross is handled despite the strike.
The transport of food and the dispatch of hospitals and laboratory samples is also sought.
You can find information on the services on the Post website.
Most of the Finnish Origins close their doors on Friday for two hours.
The Services Trade Union Pam has instructed its employees to stop work between 11:00 and 13:00.
Pam has also called on day-to-day trade workers to participate in the demonstration of professional organisations.
Representatives of the SOK and Kesko will tell the Sanos of Helsinki that they are trying to keep the stores open, if necessary, by supervisors.
According to Kesko, there is still no information on the possible closure of individual shops.
The Helsinki Day Homes are partially closed
The Helsinki Day Homes do not work in full on Friday, inform the Helsinki Early Education Office.
Due to the expression of mind by professional organisations, daily treatment may be concentrated on certain day-care facilities, and no club activities of day-care homes and playgrounds will be organised.
Day homes and groups of children with disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of schoolchildren with disabilities and autists are normally organised.
The Early Education Office will be authorised to inform further changes to the activities tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipila, a wide range of channels is needed for communication, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
This is also the channel of direct speech that will be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to the journalists in the parliament.
Sipila did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches become.
According to the Sipilah, talks may not always be dealt with in the future on Ylen channels.
If other channels sign up as a channel, then we'll see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the economic situation in Finland is so serious that it requires a TV and radio speech to the citizens.
This issue, which is being discussed here, is quite complicated and requires a further justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel. Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 in both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
The Sipilah takes a big risk.
The media investigator hopes that Sipilä’s television speech does not tell us more generally about turning in the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to make public debate more rigorously into their own hands and refuse to put up a public debate?
It reminds me of the recent comment of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and lets it define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not linked.
I understand that the commercial media is upset by Sipilha's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not reporting issues in democracy.
It is the role of media representatives to make a definite effort not to adopt political agendas when given.
According to the experience, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, the Sipilah should bring something new and special to the table so that the exceptionally high expectations of the talk can be met.
Is there more that we've already heard today?
Or is he able to speak in different terms, differently, or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if the permit has only the same old one, we must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
It is a risk to be taken in this sense, insofar as this is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle is stamped as a mediator of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in accordance with Yle's interests or the public line.
A sleeve-squeeze bet
In the forthcoming speech of Sipila, what the Prime Minister leaves a message is also important, the media researcher stresses.
At night, we need to look closely at what Sipilla is missing and what she does not, says Heikki Six, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the Sixth, the TV speech is a clever bet from Sipila, because this makes it possible to bring up its own view without a horror voice.
This gives the message a general public without a journalistic filter, unlike at an information meeting where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä skips the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, the danger is that the media misinterpret something about the speech, because there are no specific questions to be asked.
According to the six, it's very important how Sipilla appears on TV... if it's sweating, if your hands tremble.
He compares Sipilla to a father-in-law who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilla can make her point well, it can work.
The situation is different from when the government would inform you about something, because in this person it is like talking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and partners of President Barack of the United States regularly do.
Very Extraordinary
The policy investigator Erkka Railo considers the speech of the Prime Minister to citizens truly exceptional.
He said that this has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister will speak directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The investigator believes that this is how the Prime Minister wants the Finns to be sympathetic with the pressures ahead.
On Friday, the employees' organisations will organise a demonstration and strikes against government activities.
On Twitter, President of the Left Association, Paavo Arhinmäki says that Sipila could hold her speech about the state of the nation in the parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, and that the speech would also be discussed.
The president of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), reiterates its challenge to the Sipilian dialogue.
We don't have time for the monologues.
About six months from the election.
You can't hide the endless. Rinne writes on Twitter.
The boy on his nine-year-old escape has been found in Tampere.
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
The boy's father updated his Facebook pages.
The Police Department of Finland also confirms the issue for the evening press.
The boy went out for a play at 4:00 a.m.
Later this evening, there was no contact with him.
Dad thanks all the people who helped us find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed more than 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed by the violence of young people: You are in the process of hatred
Makwan Amirchani, a Kurdish free fighter, published a video on Facebook, which appeals to young immigrant backgrounds in particular.
Makwan Amirkhani had to speak against young street fights.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arrived with his family, who was five years old in Finland, has so far won both his professional game in the most renowned UFC series.
Amirchani says she received a message asking me to see a Instagram account.
Videos have been downloaded to the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the wildlife of young people.
A 26-year-old Amirchan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
You guys kick down, sit on the other side and strike blindly without thinking about any of the consequences of this when you do these videos, Amirchani's up-to-date.
It's hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people on videos are immigrant backgrounds.
According to Commissioner Jarmo Heinos of the Helsinki Police, social media has downloaded fight videos for both immigrants and domestic youths.
It's just that you guys are fighting all over the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, the Turkian Amirchani reminds us.
Amikhani reminds us that there are websites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite abundant.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be here for a long time.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here, says Amirchani.
Amirchhani tells young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the target of some racism, you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Just think about it a couple of times before you go with that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action gives rise to racism.
You're going to get the hatred that I don't like.
You're having a pretty bad time anyway, and that's not what you're going to do to make them better, Amirchani decides.
The SAK takes his position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, President-in-Office of the SAK, Lauri Lyly tells us that the employees' organisation will consider on Monday its position on the alternative savings list presented by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
The STTK previously informed the Government of its own proposal on Wednesday to achieve the 5% productivity rate required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre).
The open President, Sture Fjäder, believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and the Akaka are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest employees' organisation to soften its previous position.
Mr Lauri Lyly, president of the SAK, commented in a slight manner on Twitter.
Mr Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to open the labour market and that agreements made by active parties are needed in the place of forced laws.
Mr Lyly recalls that the proposal by the Government of Mr Sipilä for a social agreement was not valid for the SAK.
In the past, Sipilä cut the negotiations on the social agreement when the SAC refused to commit to the 5% productivity target.
Comment: A big show threatens to leak, "I think it's a bit funny to put on a fist"
It feels a bit funny to put a fist in your pocket, if there's already a reconciliation paper, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmospheres vary from the side of the wage camp.
Is it meant to call the government to annul, or is it to agree with it?
On Monday, the Feds of the SAK cried the sacred hatred of the Government of the Republic.
Whole Finland was threatened to close up.
It spread to the nobles, too.
The teachers' organization OAJ threatened to close schools and day care homes.
Tuesday, the OAJ canceled: no school or daycare is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) Chairman of the STTK was reconciled.
He said that he had kept contact with the government and that he would draw up the alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) for a five-prozent productivity score.
Mr Sture Fjäder (kok) rushed to report immediately that his paper was already ready.
At first, there wasn't a yard in the GERMAN's office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to settle when the federal leaders just on Monday ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAC would meet next Monday to deal with the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions for "opening the labour market".
In order to create a joint presentation by employees, the SAK should tend to accept a 5% productivity rate as a target.
No miracle is that Palolan STTK has relations with the Government of Sipilah.
The right hand of the fire, the director of the STTK’s social contribution, Jukka Ilonus, was formerly the special assistant of the Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhaske and Mari Kivinieme.
The Palola characterized that government ay-knowledge has been improved all the time.
Coincidence or no, but Palola's exit took a little bit off the Finnish stoppers, which, in the picture of which, evacuated by the ACP Marko Pierainen (sd).
I mean, it feels a bit funny to put on a fist if there's already a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18.00 p.m.: Added information on Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland as a bad host: "This must not happen again."
The President of the Russian duma Sergei Naryshkin criticised the Helsinki OSCE.
Sergei Naryshkin, the Russian Duuma President, believes that Mongolia is a better host of the OSCE than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, the OSCE has started a symposium, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki Hungary Conference.
In that case, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who have been forced to enter the European Union, to attend the meeting - a matter that the President referred to as journalists.
We believe that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of an open dialogue.
This can't happen again, Naryshkin emphasised the news office, according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was addressed to the United States, which was also prevented from entering.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshk's poster.
The Russian delegation of Mongolia was inconvenienced, so Naryshkin continued to speak to Finland with praise and praise of Mongolia for the 'experienced organisation'.
I am sure that the Parliamentary General Assembly will go constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
Mongolia's leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Kook), who has already discussed the Russian delegation, according to the Russian media.
The lock meets a real playoff mirror: "The paintings in a tight place"
Tappara and Slukko are going on today in the Haka forest for bull days when both are on fire on the second day.
Janne Lahti predicted today that there was no real goal celebration in the Haqqani forest.
Tappara went to Kuopia last night to a 3-2-long-term victory on KalPa.
The rise was manly, because the silver team of the last season was at its worst about the loss position of two goals.
The lock was more mosle than Tuesday.
The Ramalians’ catch as the guest of Blues was round zero points, and the loss counts were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any are playing the same game as last year, the Clasp-Scraper Janne Lahti anticipates the settings of the company on the pages.
The slayer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the cranes.
In fact, in the last two periods, Tapara has just dropped in the middle of the Luko final series.
Both times the solution has been called for a decisive seventh match.
In the last season, the Lock took the series off in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three sides and past.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups except for the target carpets.
Both the cashiers rejected last night will get a turbulent shift today.
With the goal of the Killer, Mika Noronen makes space for Tomi Bearhus, and between the lock-drops, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Vision angle: A nasty play going on in the Aesia
The sports director Toomala handwritten the inappropriate extension of the head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoine from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone handwritten Rocky film, where he played the main part.
The underman put a heavy series on the world champion Apollo Creed in a sensational way.
Rocky got great sympathy, even though he finally lost the title game.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Tolala handwritten the unrest moto in Pori.
The anonymous and wooden batteries went on to everyone's surprise for the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but stubborn underwriters like Rocky.
There was a white Indian, Pori Matt and Pelle Pelto.
In fall games, the players colored their heads red and cut off the irokes.
The wishball became a blonde.
The great TV reporter JP Jalo called Coach Neumann.
Asses took the won silver.
The hope was one of the heroes.
The manwriter, Tolala, believes that the new work of this season works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as the Aces' sports director has built a pawn in the hands of the devil boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have spilled guys in a box like Rocky's pig carnations in a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitsen, Juha Kilholma and Matti Kuparis' earnings are in some other place than in a giant game.
Mr. Hailah has forgotten that Rocky VI's main role is being played by Pekka Rautakalio.
Karri Stone has crossed the Sean Connery of the Rautakallion.
Iron Tallio is a handwriting writer of the Rocky, who is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's nothing like Rocky in the iron casket but a nickname.
Iron Ball's game philosophies aren't part of crawling and peeling.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's different to play hard like a pig.
In the last season, Garrett Stafford of the Asses stabbed Tapara into the head of Jere Karyan.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Tallion put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I don't accept a game like that, and it's not part of the ashtray, Ironakalio, hot, worn up after the game to the people of the Satate.
The Aesian team of this season has been constructed strangely.
There are trains, veterans, cops, and cheerleaders.
In practice, there are no key men in the best game age.
No wonder the principal coach has complained about a lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence the player's acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season's events have an impact on procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather short, Rautakallio responded diplomaticly.
Underneath the surface.
The 1953 Rautakallio of the Year model is known to be interested in moving to Toula's place to a sports bomb.
The men's contracts will end in the spring.
There are equally many losses in the three leagues of the Aes' balance of the season with the target difference of 1-6.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband when she was a teenager in Tuuka, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time in the direction of her husband.
Yeah, I'm playing the mother of my husband's friend in the movie.
In a way, it seems crazy, an actor, and a producer of Olga Temonen laughs.
He's been married to a Abilanna's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has worked a lot together before, but for the first time, Olga plays in Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in telling us about the early years of Abilanna You made us a beautiful film is the drummal Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
The circling of the chimp and supports his son, even though his father Risto (that performs Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be a sound of sense.
The more I have learned my real picture of Sirkka, the easier it is to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuukka that he trusted me in the role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the twin has become much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, communicated.
The circus has been very helpful.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
I'm also lucky to understand that drama is drama and the truth may need to be slightly colored.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Aidan would become the biggest band in Finland.
In the '90s, it was lame and really dull.
There was a pretty small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga tells me that she had heard a lot from Tuukka before the film plans.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been slightly different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuuka, known as Heinola’s infamous sketch.
Olga was a palace and a nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
He could've had a secret love.
According to Olga, over the last 10 years, he has worked so hard with Tuuka that a large joint project is not scary.
It's always been super-good.
Now the whole production group goes to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in Italy is often planning to drive home for the sake of their little children for the night, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over all Heinola for a month.
They have taken us very warmly, just asked which streets and when to be empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play film in Finland
Iron Sky, controlled by Timo Bergensola: The Coming Race film has a budget of EUR 17 million.
The photographs will start in October in Belgium.
Timo Vuurensola, director, begins to picture the Iron Sky 2 film in October in Belgium.
The Scifie movie Iron Sky extension, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, is the most expensive play film in Finland with its 17 million euros budget.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on Jumalari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation in action is rising after the completion of Iron Sky 2 as the film's budget is over EUR 100 million.
The films of Timo Vuurensola and Tero Remote will begin in October at the AED Studios premises near Antwerpen and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuurensola is going to Belgium next week.
The giant budget isn't scare.
I've been so sick!
I'm so relaxed about a cool script because I know exactly what a movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though the time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he'll tell the evening magazine.
Originally, 8 to 10 million were planned for the film's budget, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big storie, too.
However, a picture of 100 million should be pressed because each angle and every performance is so expensive.
Now everything's been so tight, that there's no discovery.
The film production company Iron Sky Universale launched this Wednesday a public finance campaign and a bond with a annual interest rate of 4-8%.

Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trends have recently been cleaned by big logos.
A while ago, a fashion-consequent dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs and Crocs.
Advertising the hood or t-shirt mark was seen as a junkie.
It's time that changes.
Sports has become a real Megatrend of fashion, and so have old, familiar sports models like Adidas and Nike risen to the cool wavebridge.
And, like so often before, the boundary of funny and trendy is ugly: if something is already right, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm Core trend, i.e. a tasmo, where the trendsetters surprised to recommend the most boring basic clothing as a means of separating from the mass.
Now, instead of a gray basic college, it's already buried on the bottom of the cabinet, in front of which the manufacturer's logo comes up.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas identified rails, the favorite team's gambling shirts and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to the street.
Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports markers to luxurious bands.
For example, the brass of Versace’s Snacks make it clear what a sign of clothing is about.
Would you be ready to introduce logos in your dressing?
The Russian police officer published the evidence: I didn't sit in the tank lock for hours!
According to the allegations, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, which held Russia Arms Expo, representing Russian military products, 2015.
The Russian media has spread colorful claims in recent days that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove Zotov from large sizes for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to challenge the data.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook pages, in which he seems to be swinging around the door of a tanker vehicle in very good moods and, at least, on the basis of these images, it is about being stuck or angry.
That's bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into the battlepanzer, but it was a raid tank BMP-3.
I've been a former soldier, Colonel. I've served at Ural.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace, Zotov told Comosomolskay to Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I really didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
To the Russian army's TV channel Zotov explained his desire for the exhibition of Russia's new technology, as he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagon, and I was attracted to our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And I'm definitely going to take all the tanks and all the collision tanks to the next exhibition, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called a reporter who wrote it as an idiot.
One fool wrote, and everyone else said it again.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and rattled, but nothing like I'm stuck somewhere in a tank, it didn't happen, he said to the Russia sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photograph of the alleged imprisonment has been published, even though in a few days, a total of 50.000 people attended the arms exhibition.
The claim of Zotov’s imprisonment started on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotov was told that he was ripped out of the tank lock when he tried and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around, unless he escaped the surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a further story in which the organizers of the exhibition explained their view of what happened.
Everyone's just used to jumping quickly out of armed vehicles.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his large size, simply stayed when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours, said to Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot, coordinator of the exhibition.
Here's the favorite thing for the decorative bloggers.
The architectial brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Fleming (1902-84) The laser candle from 1962 appears to be designed today.

Architectal brothers are known for long and mathematically accurate form of a barn.
At first, it was presented only to the renowned guests of the lords for dinner.

You're trying someone's endurance.
He's not a piece of paper, but you know he's not like a stone.
You are the same on a number of things, like life force.
You're wondering how things go on.
You have strength and willful space to make them succeed.
Mildness to yourself and to others is also important.
You're smart, but you're not fast enough to make someone understand your position on this matter.
He's slow, and he doesn't want to be in charge with you, even with you.
You're going with someone on foot, because there's one thing going on.
There is no one way to approach it, but at least you know that you have a common goal.
You've taken a measure with someone.
But you are not competing in the traditional sense, but you want to know what he is really like for his men or women.
Your presumption will hit the right one.
That's why it's good to brace your chest.
You have a chance to be dealing with someone today.
Do it, even if your time is on the card.
There's a person of a particular nature.
You'll understand that at the latest when he opens his mouth.
Also, the parasites and expressions tell a lot a long time before that.
Someone's gonna be sad for you.
You do not notice that there would be anything amazing in this situation, but there is a lot of vague atmosphere in the air.
You know where you're going.
Your experience is right, even though someone wants to show you he is much more aware of things than you do.
The need for emphasis isn't the only thing that's sniffing in him.
Your preparedness for various tasks has grown over the years.
Someone sees potential in you.
It's going to work on your self-esteem.
You'll be wondering if there's anything wrong with it.
You're on the edge of the essence.
You know a lot where you move and who you want to spend your time with.
You don't stay in your place. You want to move forward.
You highlight a certain kind of thing about yourself so much that someone starts talking to you for that reason.
We're not going to end this conversation.
It shows how interesting you are.
There's been a leak in the Kittlä Mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The purified process water of the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called enrichment sand substrate into a stream.
According to the company, the measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool has neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water from the waxing process.
Usually, water is pumped for either re-use as process water or subjected to authorisation through the surface lining field to the environment.
The bleeding was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic meters per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leak water meets the current permit conditions.
There was no other substance in the environment.
The bleeding was observed during the inspection round on Monday morning.
No structural damage has been found to the dam structures of the pool.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred fixed workers.
Dansen Cuppomäki: IMF warns you not to cut too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund, published by the IMF, follows broadly the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation paved to structural reforms covering Finland to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime allowances and paid holidays would contribute to Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contract system and for unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank's main economist Pasi Kuoppamämä, structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimate has a great deal of sympathetic messages for government activities, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Economic Sanome.
The IMF also feels that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support poor economic growth.
The IMF anticipates an economic growth of 0.4% for Finland for this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske anticipates today in its new forecast of economic growth this year.
The IMF is slightly more optimistic than this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was growing in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
The weaker confidence in industry or other so-called softer indicators could be reduced.
However, the differences are only a few per cent of the decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appointed a new leader
In July, under the responsibility of Saturu Iwata, who worked for cancer, Tatsumi Kimishima began working on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was popular and charismatic face in the game industry.
Iwata, for example, responded to the successful lanseration of Wii-console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima isn't a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assessing Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to be seen as taking Nintendo strongly into mobile games, but not to eat the company's bread on the traditional game consoles.
In Finland, more and more minor asylum seekers arrive alone
The Swedish Immigration Agency already recognised in February 2015 that hundreds of children who have come to the country will disappear annually.
The Swedish Immigration Agency says that hundreds of minors will disappear annually, among other things, on the website of SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter.
Juha Kannelmaa, the supervisor of the Immigration Service, tells us what the situation in Finland is and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear under the "land" year?- In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications were made for minors alone.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, similar applications were submitted 196 and 11 cannelmaa has disappeared.
As a result of the disappearance, it may be clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has been identified as a full age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue to deal with the matter in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some missing persons will also be found later when they are applying for asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were decommissioning decisions because the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the last 123 years, he says.
Is there an increase in the number?
By 6.9 this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications for minors alone.
There are no overall statistics on missing minor asylum seekers this year, but the number of minor applicants is known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he emphasises.
What about those who have decided to revert?
Will they, for example, be lost on the "black labour market"?
This is difficult to assess with regard to the Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the reciprocal decisions, and Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of Interior Petter Orpo (Cook) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered seekers.
He has taken action on this matter.
On Monday, the Orpo, who thought about refugee issues at the EU Minister of Interior, told us about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. studio online - see pictures of devices
Due to the seizures, Timo T.A. The equipment used for the TV and radio production of Mikkosen is now sold.
Mikkosen’s spouse Nina Mikkonen sells the equipment at Huuto.net, which were once the most advanced professional tools in the field.
The first web page on the website was the Nightmacasin.
Today, a large part of the equipment has been left on the footsteps of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs are no longer filmed for Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still trusting that there are interested people.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that must be digitalised.
On the other hand, there's also a lot of hobbies, collectors and own studio builders, Nina Mikkonen thinks about IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move away from the present House of Myrskylä.
There's no way we can take all the goods with us.
I've slowly started to invent and see what stuff they're giving up.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no use for television and radio equipment anymore.
As a result of recent strokes in the brain, it is clear that a man who made a long career will not return to work again.
Nina Mikkonen says they're just selling goods and equipment now.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s actual life work was archived in the summer of the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up movies and other materials from Myrskyla.
Transport threatens to drill worse than it thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The metro and the drivers of the trams will decide today whether they will expand their forces with regard to Friday's demonstration of mind.
The original plan was to stop the transport of metro and trams only for the time of the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it's gonna work out if the traffic stops all day.
The main trust man, Pekka Hirvonen, says the threat is big on the ground.
The night and shift cuts are badly shaking the drivers, so the government's plans to cut the limbs are causing resistance.
However, it is a dilemma that the stopping of traffic for the whole day is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport is practically almost completely stopping in the capital area.
According to VR's data, trains do not travel between 6 a.m. and 6 a.m. on Friday.
On Friday, there's no local or long-distance traffic.
The trains left before 6:00 in the morning will be driven to the stations.
According to the HSL data, most of the buses remain in the shadow.
The ACP members are away from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, driven by headmen, and the HSL reporter Pirkko Repo bills.
Repo says that HSL is unable to say exactly what bus ranks are taking on Friday.
Employee organisations are organising a major announcement at the Helsinki Rautiatentor on Friday at 11-13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to the local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water jets against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas, and the teacher thought it was a self-conscious watch bomb.
In Texas, the 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher held the original watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News he wanted to show her about the output of his electronics.
However, one of the teachers thought the bell looked like a bomb.
The police were invited to attend, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to the juvenile prison cell.
Mohamed has never been found to claim anything but that he had made a watch.
Still, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had said the clock looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in the police's storage, but it was known to be composed of a circuit board and a digital display with wires.
The incident happened last Monday, and Mohamed was punished for three days from school.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Islamic Council of the country wonders if the case is another evidence of islamophobia in the United States.
The president of the labour refused to sing a national song.
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism presented by the press which is delicate to the right has also been accompanied by the representatives of Corbyn's own labour party.
This has hurt the people, thought the labour national representative Kate Green in the radio interview of the BBC.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday’s commemorative event respected the battle of British Air Force Flyers against German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corby in its official opinion and emphasises that he has shown his respect for pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood still with respect during the national song, emphasised in the statement.
Corbyn's choice of party leader has divided the labour lines.
In particular, there are those who fear him to deport moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby supports unilateral disarming, the closure of savings and the increase in public expenditure.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn is supposed to be present in Parliament as a party leader at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for proposals on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron was picking Corbyn as party leader over the weekend on Twitter.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister's twitter on his own account.
The reason for Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for a legal case.
South Lake Minnetonka police have soon been investigating the family death in Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
The five - souled family was found dead on September 10, and a few days later, the police confirmed that the shooter was Brian Scott Short, the father of the family, 45.
The first time Brian Short shot himself in the garage, his wife and three children were shot with a shotgun, he killed himself.
Dead days ago
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection visit and found a huge house all over Short’s family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million houses and a successful company
South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar's case is still under investigation.
The motive of the blood cells is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on AllNurses.com, a social media site for nurses.
In 2014, in the interview with StarTribune, Short reported that there were four million different visitors on the site every week.
I have been awarded 50 buy-in bids over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell a company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the fact that Short’s family bought a house in Greenwood in 2011 for two million dollars.
The house is advertised to a real estate site in Zillow as a car collector’s dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also eight cars are equipped with a garage.
The Justice case on the line
But according to StarTribune, the father of the family was waiting for a case of justice.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various prepaid courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no prepaid comments had been removed from Short's website and had therefore lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the proceedings would have had a very significant impact on Short’s transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffees
In addition, three of the owners were rewarded at the treatment event at the monthly Hippos Prize.
It's great, Loiri commented in a good mood on her glorious table.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist's legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the big competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the success horse coach Korpi will get full peace of work with the horse when working with the horse.
Pekka tells me where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'm gonna keep my mouth shut, Loiri laughing.
The great gesture of the NHL star, "The greatest donation ever made by a sportsman"
The Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated 10 million dollars (approximately EUR 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to the hospital press, this is a single donation made by the largest athlete of all times to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26 - year - old Subban is committed to assisting the hospital in other cases for the next seven years of its fundraising.
A year ago, Subban made an agreement with Canadiens worth eight years and 72 million dollars.
So the amount of subban donation is significantly higher than that of his nine million dollars in the year.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive a hall space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have already helped local hospitals considerably.
A year ago, the long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same child hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a giant amount of money for another city’s major hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
You can order a wife from a Japanese coffee shop tonight, serves food with a bikini and a squirrel on her.
The theme cafes are tough in Japan.

Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: the attacks on car security began to be equipped with:
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, the information document published by Intel.
The Board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out ongoing safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practice in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of the results of the ASRB study.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consultancy company, estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in the transport sector have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles can consume, generate and distribute online data.
We can and we must improve the cyber security of cars, says Chris Young, head of Intel Security.
With the help of the ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of each connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road, which makes ASRB the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about EUR 52 000 in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS model has been expected for years as a rising moon.
Finally, the car begins to be in the face of Finland.
Ford published RS data now that the car world's eyes are on the Frankfurt car exhibition.
Ford's new four-wheel RS accelerates, thanks to its 2.3-litre, 350-speed engine, in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and high speed it has 266 kilometres per hour.
There is also a price for Finnish interest, it is presumed to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already ordered, though when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell us when he is briefed.
The favorite sign Kia presented two new news at the Frankfurt car exhibition - these are new Sportage and Optimia
The new fourth generation of Sportage is certainly more important than the two new Finnishs, with which Kia intends to catch a larger wing from the ever-growing streetist market.
The new design manager of Europe, Gregory Guillaume, created by Sportage, is more round than before.
There's been an inch in the axle and outdoors, and the car's breaking air more efficiently.
The range of engines is in its main character, but it has been added to 177 horsepower-enhancing turbos of 1.6 litres.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption is reported closer to sales.
We'll have to wait a little longer, because we'll have a new Sportage coming in the spring of 2016.
The new Kia Optimás came to our country before the year went to change.
Suddenly, the news doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of the higher middle class buyers with improved driving features, lower noise level and higher level of equipment.
At first, Optimizes are obtained with 1,7 litres of turbodiesel and 2,0 litres of petrol engines.
Next summer, the pace will be accelerated when Optima GT, equipped with a turbo engine of 2,0 litres, arrives alongside them.
At the same time as you come, you start selling Optimia farmer.
Chisu returned to the stages... sneaked in a bold wrist suit.
The singer Chisu is part of the Life Baby concert with other domestic stars.
There's a beautiful, open neck hole in the blue pants.
The costume will be beautifully presenting the creek of the singer's belt.
The whole is crowned by a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During the three years of break, a singer who became a mother has been able to get pregnant with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year.
The singer published his first single from his new album in August.
Back to the stages and to the public after a long break, I'm not really excited.
I've been so sorry to do everything about music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will publish in a couple of weeks his new album, and at the same time his fourth album called Polaris.
A new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, I'm wondering if people find my new album, Chisu's wondering.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is again annoying... now you see the front.
The real-tv beauty Kim Kardashian gives the topics one after each other.
She presents her pregnancy bag and breast-lifting with noisy sexy clothes last night at 1 am in America when she and her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, left Kanye West's job.
Black maternity dress is transparent in front of the breasts.
It reveals the skin colored bras under the lightning dress.
The last time Kardashian was dressed as an amateur motherhood when she visited her friend for dinner in New York only a few days ago.
They emphasised black over-generation assassins.
The third special maternity costume is as fresh as from Friday last week, when a pregnancy bag was in the showtime.
The hard laws of the world of models: No home, you are lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne.
He made his own documentary of Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues speak their mouth clean of model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered Leloup's six hard truths behind the cults.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even in the previous period, even if you had been chewing in the homes of top designers, the new season begins with castings again.
And every season comes new, fresh faces that compete from work with the coconuts.
Malls rarely have a place to call home.
The work is a continuous travel and can take a year so as to have a hotel room or a apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother can not travel with you, loneliness can be inadmissible.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of weight.
Agent New York might ask you to drop the kilos, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion, the models and designers are together all the time, while they are a support network.
When the fashion sauces are out, the difference is vague.
The models want this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but the fact that everyone thinks it's just a presentation of clothes.
Even models want to be their own personality.
Work makes the models feel that they're actors with some kind of role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
The models last night at Tory Burch's show.
In New York, fashion weeks are being spent, where designers reveal their models next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Avalanta musician in the movie
Roope Salminen presents an AAA in a film based on the early years, Antti Lautala, the founder of the band.
In 1991, Latala set up Abilanna with Toni Wirtase, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me because I'm a rap-artist who's about 26 years old, and in this movie I play a 16-year-old guitarist, Salmine laughs.
I didn't want to meet the real Ant before the shoots, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to the people, so I think it's good that I only learn his playstyle from the video.
I don't want to make an imitation of a person.
The man who's been riding the Roope Salmine and the Dog Association isn't going to do the role.
The Punk Maniers are coming according to the man's nature.
In the punk season of the Stars and Stars, I'm sure a lot of people saw the prestige, as well as if they've ever been to our works.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go full.
The main performers of the "Basso" film were published today by Tuukka Temose, who played the bass in 1993-2004.
Young actresses who are still quite unknown to the audience are presenting a nuclear force familiar to the band’s audience.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki plays Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo basist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip about her future washing last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he would prepare for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published yesterday in Instagram a picture of his new log that he has had to perform for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the whiskey and the jaws, has driven his face to be silopous, and colored his brown hair black.
Psychologist Advice: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
We don't need to talk about this, a member of the SPR crisis team, a psychologist who advises Ferdinand Garoff.
It is worth protecting younger children, for example, not allowing them to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and they can stay spinning in mind and harassing, he says.
However, if a child has encountered television news pictures of refugees or heard it elsewhere, it is worth speaking.
It is good to have a discussion on the starting points of the child and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of the child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones that the parent thinks he is afraid of.
A child should not be frightened for nothing, even if he's intimidated and frightened.
A younger child closely monitors the behaviour of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe.
Larger children will probably encounter a debate on refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to speak with them if it is a matter of reflection on the child.
The fact is, not all people in the world are well.
Parents and children can wonder how our family feels about this.
However, do we think that the world is at last a safe place or a safe place?
The parents may also have different educational perspectives, some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family talks about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the challenges that come ahead in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.

Your own powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child
It's hard to control the fireland that hit the blood.
Pertus Pohjola was able to squeeze Apila's fireplace to stare at the attack in the middle of the summer.
It was only winnings and second-hands until, at the end of July, in Tampere, there was a collapse.
Since the slave was completely narrowed down, the coach suspected that something was wrong and ordered time from the veterinarian on his safe way.
The explanation for the discharge was found in the spectator.
The horse had an infection of the throat.
The disease wasn't from the mildest head, but it needed two medications to control it.
As the Pallosalama of Apula was forced to exercise lightly, Pohjola says that she is positively surprised by the last run of the horse.
It was in Turku at its record time after the wind of the SE-dog.
The Pallosalama of Appilan was under extreme pressure when it had been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
With these things in mind, a small tendency at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a fair competition has made a lot of work for the slaves.
I'm sure the horse’s vein went ahead, and I hope it would have been even.
Apilan's fireballama has been the so-called humor horses.
When it hasn't been for fun, it could have been thrown into a fat one without the sick.
On a good day, the slaves have been removed by such a lightning book that the opponents have been wondering.
At the speed of the tide, the turtles can't make it to the fireland, where even the hot-blooded rides are cut off.
The northern hopes are in Vermo.
However, the difference is how the Apulan Pallosalama agrees to do so.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might be under the bus and that kind of thing.
I hope the slave is more calm than at Turku's departure.
Apilana's Pallosalama is also capable of coming from the bow, and we are going to drive it, Coach's permission.
This is why you can't get rid of your iPhone software.
Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of Apple's iPhone phones can sometimes be removed in the future, but not all of them.
Apple may intend to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, reports the company’s CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed interview.
Apple's iPhone contains a number of programs that are relatively rarely used: FaceTime phones, Lehtkioski, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Vinks.
The most recent addition to these programmes is Apple Watch, who became a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is necessary for Apple's smart cell owners only.
According to Cook, the removal of Apple's programmes is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications have been linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple's iPhone applications work closely together with other programmes.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter because the company does not want to waste memory space from the iPhone phones of users.
Inflation in the euro area decreased to 0.1 per cent in August
In August, consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly, i.e. 0.1 per cent from year-on-year, and Eurostat reported today by the EU statistical authority.
The rise in prices was caused by energy lowering downwards.
In this way, Eurostat reviewed the 0.2% estimates from a couple of weeks ago.
In July, inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2 per cent cheaper than one year ago in the euro area last month.
The average inflation in the whole of the 28 EU countries was zero in August.
In July, there was an increase of 0.1 per cent.
Most of the euro countries, i.e. 1.4 per cent of consumers' prices, rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest at a decrease in prices by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the harmonised EU price index.
Inflation in the euro area is still very far away from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is an increase in prices of two per cent in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
Next year, the rise will increase to 1.1%, and the central bank will anticipate its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
US Fed's next trying to blackmail monetary policy
The next recession in the United States begins at a faster rate than one year, but more certainly within three years after the central bank of the country Fed starts to raise its interest rates for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the fall starts before the next recession.
Fed has insisted that it may already start the interest rates this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
Therefore, the next recession can be pushed up at the fastest by the next autumn and as a financial market course before that.
Or at least this will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets work as they have been in the way they have been and if they react to the extortion of Fed's financial assets as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been concluded by the German Bank Deutsche Bank’s strategics Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a study report on Long-Term Asset Return Study, which was over 60 pages, to its international major customers last week.
The strategy drawn up by the research and report does not believe that they will know exactly when Fed will start to raise its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market after that.
Instead, they present with the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, how the economy and the market have previously behaved during and after Fed’s interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they will examine the key parameters of the economy and financial markets now in the same or other model as at the time of previous interest rates - and what may be followed.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more delicate condition to sustain the rise in interest rates than once before in the 1950s.
Maybe not a year ago.
Throughout the last summer and early autumn, Fed’s monetary policy and the leaders responsible for its respective stimulus have pointed out that the time will begin to be ripe to raise interest rates.
The first interest rate for over nine years can start this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised his so-called Fed Funds control rate in June 2006.
That was the end of a series of fairly regular but at a timely rate of 0,25 percentage points, where Fed increased its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The symptom of the financial markets began in 2007 with the most risk-weighted housing funding in the United States, and one year later the financial crisis broke into a global judging nightmare.
There was a major regression in 2009.
Last time, serious countervailings in the financial markets and the real economy began more slowly than since previous Fed’s interest rates have typically happened.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harder than once in the 1930s.
Deutsche strategies have seen the risings and bills of the largest economies in the world, as well as the conversions of the financial markets since 1950 and, from the beginning of the 18th century.
From the 1950s, Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impacts will be cleared.
The most rapid time since the first interest rate has taken place is less than one year, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The upturn in the financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed's interest rates.
Fed has repeatedly raised and adjusted its steering rate since the beginning of the 1950s to a dozen different cycles.
In some cases, each time is different from another, and the number of times is relatively scarce in the review, so it is hardly possible to conclude any sure effect of the subsequent interest rates.
The strategy also reminds us that a number of things are different this time.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The key causes of the financial crisis may not necessarily be unquestionably identified by research for decades.
But for the reasons that led to the crisis and which have increased its destructive power, there must be some doubt:
1) Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other world's largest central banks held their governance rates too low in the 21st century.
They hired the prints of the technopup and raised the next.
2) Over the decades there was an accumulation in the financial and real economy, and still too much debt has increased as a result of the monetary policy of the central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in the economic history of the past was born.
3) In particular, the insane debt financing, which was the most liquid financial holdings, increased to most financial market sectors, the largest exchanges in economic history from shares in real estate, bonds and commodities.
Moreover, it is hard to argue that the high-risk financial markets, which have become more complex, were rarely dangerous and unstable when Fed and other central banks last drove up interest rates.
As a result, the financial structures underpinned by the debt instruments could not last as long as their period of time after the acquisitions had started and the cost of the debt financing had turned to rise.
The risks occurred as a financial crisis and resulted in a major recession.
Greater bubble and more debt
Deutsche strategies do not think what will happen next, but they give the subject of nuclearism by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now viewed their monetary policy even more lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even further lower.
( 2) For a long time, debt has not been insane as ten years ago, but now, at least, debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debts of the financial and real economy have not been reduced, but now in different parts of the economy, the debt is a harder burden of debt than in the past or in the past before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity embedded by the former central banks as a leasing and cheaper place has remained largely on the financial market and has slowed down the key types of securities and assets to its highest value, or never before the financial crisis.
And the strategic atmosphere is not only in the light of the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not recovered from the financial crisis and, for decades, from the hardest regression to the model that has taken place before.
The economy in the euro area has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually poor state but similarly the pressures and risks of the financial markets are significantly higher than before the financial crisis when Fed next starts to tighten up its financial burden.
Perhaps the picture of the future of the French bank Societe Generale Strategic Albert Edwards is not as strange as suddenly possible.
He has been training the international investor customers of the bank for the following complete translations:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon Fed's gonna be in a hurry to shut down the financial bills with even bigger QE money injections.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at the service side of HP, the company reports.
In November, HP will be divided into the HP Inc., the Hewlett Packard Enterprises and the consumer-oriented pc machines and printers.
The number of staff of HP was the highest in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records the unit costs of EUR 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce 250.000-30000 employees.
Consumer side reductions will remain to 3300 within three years.
The HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10 % of its operating profits.
In another year, its three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of their operating profits.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system after an update of the iPhone Apple
You can ask for a new operating system by going to the Settings application, clicking "All" and then selecting "Soft Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation when the "Soft Update Error" has appeared on the screen.
In order to pass this, it is recommended that users wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update through iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include the removal of applications to obtain the status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that proposes to remove applications and then re-install them when the update is completed.
It is worth ensuring that the phone is loaded or close to the charger during the update, that the battery does not end.
If the download level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed because if the battery is finished, it can lead to a breach of the update.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked in the government of the tax haven company
According to Ylen, the Minister for Transport and Communications Anne Berner (Central) has been a member of the government of the tax haven company.
According to Ylen, the company's activities were linked to the so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxembourg company Saltri II LuxCo, whose board Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says that he has left a declaration of resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've left a divorce notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains will take place within the agreed timetable, says Berner in the Ylen interview.
Membership after merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Köhrs is a parket manufacturer who merged with the Finnish parket manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner was involved in the government of Karelia-Upoflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Köhrs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Ylen, Kährs' ownership is travelling in Luxembourg through the ownership structure of the multi-portal.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted a member of the Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Köhrs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the government of Karelia-Upoflor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company received a partner found in Sweden.
This company owned a venture capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to ensure that the capital interests of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the profits of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs already had a capital fund for the ownership of Triton, a Luxembourg holding company.
Espoo opens the reception centre held by the company
In Espoo, Otaniemi, the first reception centre maintained by the company is opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 residents today from six o'clock.
The number of places can increase to a maximum of 300 to 400 persons within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will set up a reception centre in the property of the former rescue school.
The activities are maintained by Luona Oy, which is in particular the sector of the provision of health care and medical care services.
The city of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Agency and Luona Oy agreed together, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
The STTK prepares an alternative package for job extortion
The STTK will prepare an alternative package for the government's work life blackmails.
The organisation also hopes for other employees' centres.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention at the moment is on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing labour prices will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola pointed out the organization’s administration meeting for journalists at a break.
The Palola estimates that the Central Business Association (EK) does not, however, have the capacity to discuss.
The economists of the STTK have calculated that the security of the government's competitiveness package is estimated to cost the employer EUR 30 million, while the second half of the package is 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a terrible enthusiasm on the side of the debate if there's one relationship to 100 on the other side.
Palola: The negotiation link was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has wanted alternative proposals by Wednesday, since then the government is to provide a communication on its own package to the Parliament and start preparing the reforms.
Palola did not take the view of whether the schedule is realistic.
According to Palola, the contact with the government exists, and it has been constructive for him all the time.
In particular, the surgery of Sunday tickets to the STTK field is, according to Palola, a sick place.
The organisation requires that the government withdraws from the mandatory legislation to implement a part of the blackmails.
In the STTK, according to Palola, it is not warmed up to prepare the alternative package with the SDP present.
Employees will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the work life extortion package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, for example, the salary for the first days of illness is cut, the overtime allowances are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited employees to a mental expression, and the aim has not been to organise a strike.
The Avata Fjäder congratulates
The open President, Sture Fjäder, congratulates the STTK's notification of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STTK is now on the same lines with Avata, since Akaka has already developed an alternative model for government presentations in the longer term.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be involved in the alternative package, because without the SAK, the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
The open President, Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, chaired by Lauri Lyly, will prepare the presentation as an option for surgery.
Antti Palolan STTK said that she would prepare new proposals on Wednesday.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the Agenda announced that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a 5% competitive leap of the country's government as an alternative to the cuts.
The scheme has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have been writing an alternative model for government presentations for a long time.
We are ready to see the terms of the service relationship as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to the Avata lines, as the STTK has previously done on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. on a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the same coal, the salads" plays bingo when you talk to Sipila tonight
Green Left of the University of Tampere
For the evening of the Viva Bingo Coupon of the Green Left of the University of Tampere.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exception speeches during the uprising and wars of Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy in Yle's channels on Wednesday night at 21.05.
When applying for the previous speech by the Prime Minister, we have to go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he held a famous radio speech, which meant the beginning of the end of the rebel of Mäntsälä.
After that, the President and ministers held a number of radio speeches during winter and prolongation.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held a speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more a ceremony.
In autumn 1976 President Urho Kekkonen stopped the strike of train managers by television.
Alone phone call, monarchist goin'.
The speech of the Sipilah has raised all day criticism and guessing what to come.
On Twitter, the president of the Left Association, Mr Arhinmäki, said that "Sipila could keep her speech about the state of the nation in the parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, and that the speech would also be discussed."
According to the Green Ville Ninisto, we've already seen a single phone call.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the SDP Erkki Judges condemned "monarchist makeup: the Prime Minister tells the people what's best for it".
Antti Rinne, president of the SDP, challenged the Sipilá dialogue: "After six months of elections.
No single presence from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government’s Office, Sipilä’s speech is recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was commented on a direct transmission by the President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, and the Managing Director of the EK, Jüry Hähkä Man.
I've been criticised for the speech of Sipilha.
We considered this and said that it was part of the public service task to promote the comprehensive publicity of Finland as a whole, a line in the Ismo Silvo Ylen news of Yle's publications.
It's like me at the time of the Tammels.
The speech has also raised grimms.
After dinner, the children are combed and dressed for their best.
My mom wears the most beautiful hat on her, and my dad settles the tie around her neck.
At 9:00 a.m., they're shutting down on TV like I used to old time at the time of the Tammelas," writes the blogger Saku Timone.
"Is Prime Minister Sipilä also saying in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding their heads, who are preparing the law of pardon for other tax makers' friends, and at the same time claiming to the people that it is forced to cut when the state has the rest of the money?" Pia Lohikoski asks.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is the green left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has been published on Facebook by the bingo.
Do we hear about the same boat, the common coal, the living for debts and the team angel tonight?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05, it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: the Western countries rejected the proposal of Russia for the exclusion of Al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to give up the power of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, says President Martti Ahtisaari to Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan for Al-Assad to disappear stylishly after some time.
However, the Western countries did not take the proposal because they thought Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin presented to him three points in a bilateral debate: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to get a speech contact immediately and the abandonment of al-Assad's power had to be carried out in a gentle manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree with all of this, but we will be able to discuss it openly.
I told him what I did there, and he said, "Sitting down in Alaska, Martti, and I'll tell you what to do, Ahtisaari remembers in the Guardian interview.
Diplomatics do not comment
Ahtisaari tells us that she communicated the message of Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate to the press, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari’s claims, but said that Al-Assad’s troops had already committed a number of massacres at that time, and the main opposition groups refused all agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Middle East, is apprehending the speeches of Ahtisaari because, according to his experience, Russia was at no time ready to discuss the fate of Al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest part of Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about the speeches of Tshurkin, I would have answered that I would like to hear the same thing from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have been suspicious, even in that case, that it would have been Putin's match to hold power with some Al-Assad supporter.
Refugee current for our own actions
During the negotiations on Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the current year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own actions.
I don't see any other choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we're paying for the bill we've made, Ahtisaari says to the press.
Organisational centre of asylum seekers in Tornio
The organising centre for asylum seekers planned by the Government in northern Finland is likely to be set up in the Tower.
The centre would be set up in the building of a vacancies in the city centre.
The Ministry of Interior has searched for a suitable place to better control the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, Helsinki Sanomat announced that the delegation would have already decided to present a school building as a spatial solution to the Ministry.
According to the Vice-President of the City Council of Tornio, it is not true.
When the entire delegation was not gathered and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting to decide on next Monday, he will specify to the STT.
At the local meeting, 36 of the 43 authorised persons were appointed.
13 officers were opposed to the Centre.
On this basis, it could be expected that the decision would be positive, says Höppinen.
According to Timo Nousiaien, the city received a communication on Monday, and a rapid response was made.
There would be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred feet from the border, so it would be working in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilia is still looking for an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centric), halfing of public holidays would only take part of the government's efforts to reduce the cost of work.
However, the Government would be happy to adopt an alternative package if the social partners succeed in reaching such an agreement.
Sipilä told the reporters that she had no contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for compensatory means for the blackmails of the government.
If such an agreement is concluded, we will certainly accept it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, the half of the holiday money would be a way of working, as it would be targeted by almost all employees, in contrast to the operation of Sunday bills, for example, planned by the government.
The labour market organisations could agree on the operation of holiday allowances because they are registered in collective agreements rather than in law.
In this vision, the government will tell the Parliament next Wednesday about the pressures of working life in the form of a Communication from the Government.
According to the Sipilah, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This isn't the final back limit, either.
The legislative work will then begin, i.e. the train is on the move, and it will become more difficult all the time.
It's a good time.
It won't take long for these things, if you have a will, Sipila made it.
The list published by the government last week contains, among other things, the transformation of the end-of-life and helatorista into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the salary for the first days of illness is cut, the overtime allowances are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms will be implemented as a compulsive legislative act along trade unions, which has brought great criticism.
Employee Census organisations are organising a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Mayan Lake delegation approved the extension of the sap hall warehouse
The Council of May Lakes unanimously approved the extension of the Nordic Koivu Hall, which is the juice hall.
The assessment was caused by the fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than originally spoken.
It's also a very busy schedule.
It was also a little wondered that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock at 400 to 450 square metres was approved in the investment programme, but the funding will be decided as a result of the sub-annual report.
It was still on the agenda about an investment of EUR 150 000-200 000, but Mr Erkki Iconen, technical director, said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis of the fact that it brings jobs and tax revenues to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väätö (ps.) explained.
Karelia’s Language Place in Joensuu
The city government reduced its former sturdy position to bring the street names of cattle to the center of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of maintaining the pasture of a cattle throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the cattle’s language because there are no historical grounds for it, and the language of the cattle is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the riverside has been more part of the eastern savolic fractures.
After a new decision, there will be no cattle - language street signs in the city centre.
However, the city of Joensuu is also prepared, on a case-by-case basis, to use cattle language, for example in information tables and tourism marketing.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a one-linguistic municipality, it is also worth being open to the use of cattle language now that multiculturalism is living and changing strongly in North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still the special features of the county, as well as the image of Joensuu as the entire forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be well exploited in the multidisciplinary marketing of the county.
Traffic dismantling cuts the county's vitality
The operation of train connections strikes the vitality of the county with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the province's business and competitiveness.
And that affects whether we can live and work here, Kari Karjalinen, Mayor of Joensuu, is wondering.
He also highlights air transport, which has been followed several times in the report.
It is important for the whole of the country that we do not have the chances of reducing government measures, as is now going on.
We should look at the effects of these dismantling connections on employment, for example, Karelia emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections causes an additional challenge for the University of East Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here are, like traffic connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get to students and employees, Jukka Mönkkönen says.
He points out that bad traffic links also affect a research community that is very mobile and travels much because of the research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Head of Recognition, says that it is already difficult to market a university to western Finland, as transport links are weak in the longitudinal direction.
At the moment, about half of the students from the University of Eastern Finland are from outside Eastern Finland.
At the same time, about 10-20 per cent of them are from the New Land, which is partly explained by direct connection.
Joensuu became one of my voices for the war of Siu.
The view of the municipal government of Joensuu on the regional Siu warte project is evidently unanimous, but one of my disgusting voices is among them.
Pentti Central Salo, a member of the city government (sd., in the picture) presented the Government's meeting on Monday to give up the entire project, but his performance was unreliable.
The Government accepted the decision-making proposal by Mayor Kari Karjas, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will deliver a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year
Traffic services from Eagle to Kouvola will remain in the future, although less than one train shift.
Changes in passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola will take place next March.
One pair of trains leaves behind, but still five times a day goes from the Eagle to Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to government savings.
The purchase money for the next four years of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be stopped completely.
The VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped off.
The rescue facility lets a 12 - year - old man climbing from the roof, who never got off the roof with his own help.
The situation was born at the Tornio Mountain at Ketotie at 6:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old double - layer wooden house with no ladder to the roof at all.
It did not prevent a bunch of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got the same way down, but one didn't.
As a result, others swept away from the place, and the transitors alerted the rescue facility to help the last man on the roof safely back on the surface of the earth.
FedEx's operating profit is two years old, declining the outlooks of the year 2016
FedEx reported depressive results in the last quarter, and the delivery waste cut its annual performance forecasts, due to the deteriorated demand for freight services and the higher costs of its land services.
The company also said that it intends to hire about 55 000 season workers for holidays.
At this time last year FedEx reported that it is hiring 50 000 seson workers for holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening watch.
FedEx Corp. says that next May it is expecting to end with a tax year of 10.40-10.90 dollars, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
The analysts waited $10.84 in the FactSet survey.
Despite the average price increases of 4.9%, which come into force on 4 January, and despite the higher additional charges in November in the transport of heavy or large packages.
The company said that it expects to increase its operating profits from the previous year, as they have cut costs, turnover has increased and online trade is growing.
The President and Managing Director Fred Smith said that "the company is working firmly, taking account of the less favourable economic conditions than expected, especially in production and global trade".
The plans for salaries for holidays were published the day after UPS announced that the competitor intends to hire 90-95 000 extra workers, to the same extent as it hired last year.
In the fourth quarter of August 31, FedEx scored $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The profit per share came to $2.42, which remains from the average forecast of $2.44. 12 analyst survey carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover rose by 5 per cent to $11.3 billion.
In Zacks' survey, six analysts were expecting $12,23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a reduction in international priority transport that has stopped its turnover in the Express Unit.
However, the increase in online trade has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the land unit increased by 29 per cent, but the revenues of the activities were basically the same because of the cost of the larger packages and the cost of their own insurance.
The revenues of the Express unit were better due to higher basic charges, while operating profits in freight operations decreased by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction about an hour before the opening watch FedEx's shares fell by $ 3.85, or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 per cent down to this year and 17 per cent below the 11th June record.
The finalists of the Central Bank of the United States will sit this week for two days at a long-awaited meeting around a giant mahona table and decide whether the time has come to raise the control rate for the first time to almost a decade.
On the other end of the central bank's decorative two-fold meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
It is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Central Bank, and his colleagues, should put the financial interests of the nation above all others.
The Congress has lowered the two liability of the Central Bank: they must maximise the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, since the great fall, the Governors of the Central Bank have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in a decision to be published on Thursday, which is so rigorous that it cannot be predicted, and that the US economy is ready to be retracted from a recording incentive which has been brought by almost zero short-term interest rates from the end of 2008 .
Although most of the data indicates a steady growth in the economy, the recent global financial markets could have caused a loss of precautionary bank officials to become more scarce as to increase instability, fearing how it would affect if the federal funds ratio was increased even by a quarter of a percentage.
"Intelligently, labour market and inflation are the first and most important points to be followed," says Lindsey M. Piegza, a major economic expert in the industry Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for restoring the level of interest rates, the increased uncertainty on the world market is sufficient to expect yet," he says.
The decision of the Central Bank has not reached an agreement which is already causing nervousness to the economy.
According to a recent study in Bloomberg, about half of the economic experts predict that the interest rate will rise this week.
On the other hand, the financial market expects the central bank to delay lifting, as the key indicator indicates that only about 30% of the potential for growth is available.
This refers to a fall in the securities market if the central bank raises the level if the decision-makers did not manage to soften the impact by promising that the next increase will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose by 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with a new chapter of 16 599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation of the central bank to maintain the level this week, says John Lonski, Prime Economic Expert of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if a central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they must make a lot of effort in their direction to support the financial market so that they do not panic."
Other experts claim that an increased level would calm the financial market because it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising the interest rate this month by a quarter-per-centre unit, so the first step towards slowing down the financial situation, which would ensure the stability of the United States recovery.
In the spring and early summer Yellen has said that she is expecting to rise the level this year, despite the fact that the liberals demand more economic development in their elections.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest figure for seven years and close to the level that the Central Bank considers to be a limit on full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of boosting.
Although inflation is still below the ECB’s 2% annual target, according to the central bank’s decision-makers, access to this is due to the temporary effect of the price of significantly reduced oil.
The economy "is clearer than the higher rates of interest and also needs them, taking into account the rigorous situation on the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economic Expert of the Pantheon Macroeconomics company.
However, the financial market around the world was shocked last week when China deregulated its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell by up to 16 per cent from their May Recording, when investors feared that the slowing economy in China would also slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat in this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the May Top Reader.
For decision-makers of the Central Bank, market myllery is an additional factor in a complex equation, which tells them that the interest rate should be increased.
"Nothing of these financial market events and the news of the last few weeks about the weakness of the Chinese economy, the decision-makers would steer the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, a special investigator at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, as well as an ex-Center of the Central Bank.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers will wait at least one month to gain a better perception of the effects.
"The possible impacts on the US economy are still quite unclear, and they do not have much information on the consequences of the events in China," Oliner states.
The interests of the international economy are not the main issues of the Central Bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's financial authority.
In recent years, the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernanken, the chairman of the day, suggesting that the central bank can "decade" the increase in the amount of money, caused a breakdown on the market all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly fragmented, the central bank officials are expected not only to develop elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the property management company Envesnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, pointed out this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted its financial market turnover, which has appeared to be separated from the fundamental elements of the economy."
The Federal Open Market Committee, which has taken decisions, has called for a raise of the interest, and Mr Lacker, a member of the Committee entitled to vote, calls for an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
As a result of the Asian economic crisis, the Central Bank cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings, "without its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth", says Lacker.
A year later, the central bank cancelled these operations.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during a major crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest rate determination committee.
The latest myllerrys will not come near its level, Posen states.
"No one wants to have a situation where interest rate increases are feared because the market is disrupted," says Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds two requirements and does not mention economic stability, and as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.
Do you miss the great Thai trade?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, in Chinatown.
This trade/shop was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C, which is often referred to as Thai-Costcona, is a Thai shop that also sells to private people.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown, not Thailand Town.
The store/reservation is a single stop shop offering a magnificent selection of fresh, frozen and dried commodities, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen needs, furniture and religious and celebrations.
There is even a car department in the store if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes more than an hour to rotate all the corridors.
If it makes you hungry, you can eat at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The food (good, cheap) inside the store is close to the bags, and there are several alternatives to picking up.
What's in the warehouse: Do you need anything... anything... any Thai?
LAX-C is probably selling it.
Products have been priced rationally, and most of the products are sold in wholesale packages.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruits and other products.
The muscle dish is wide, the same fish dish. The staff behind the bar cleans and filets the fish and, if necessary, if you want to shine it for you.
A large part of the movement is reserved for an enormous freezer compartment where you can find frozen curry leaves, fur cucumbers and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef meat and hat, pork skin, fish bottles, local sausages, meals and more.
Who goes to the store: Restaurant owners and cooks, but also individual families and individuals.
For levies, you'll be good at shopping carts and trunks.
Finding: Fresh monthlong duriots next to the kassa.
Where it is located: The store is located in the Los Angeles factory area near Chinatown and the center - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area that it distributes with other shops and restaurants.
Although the store may be busy, the parking lot is usually easy to find.
The Brazilian Children’s Disease Organisation in Rio Grande advertises healthy diet for mammals
The Brazilian Children’s Disease Organization (SPRS) has invented a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good food during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts that have been painted with illustrations of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients needed to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, the new study suggests that increasing calories is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by professor Robert Waterland of the Texas Baylor College of Medicine revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic appearance of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet has been shown to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is a favourite viewer in spite of Nine’s attempts to news the directorship in Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's attacks on Canberra to news the post-reports of the Liberal Party's leadership failed in increasing Today's viewers' volumes.
The Nine Channel morning program was sent from the main city of the country after Malcolm Turnbull took over Tony Abbott.
The rival program Sunrise, run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a series of sustainable international broadcasts that covers also Dubai, New York, Niagara falls and Cancun.
It did not seem that the mass of the distance was affected by the Australian television viewers, as the average of Sunrise in five state capitals was 397 000, while the figure of Today was 339 000.
Today’s average rose slightly compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has captured Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today averaged 318 000 and Sunrise 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40 000 and 50 000 viewers.
For now during September, the average of Sunrise is 349 000 with a figure of 314 000 in Today.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
Changes are blown by the winds this morning, even elsewhere than in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven Channel was the 800 words series, which presents the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, a amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which gathered a very impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, reports about a recent widow father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
The critics have been wondering if, without Rebecca Gibney, the Rafters star will be the one to bear the most popular series of Thomson.
Last night's results gave it real certainty.
The Seven Channel The X Factor program was a strong favourite for its 1,136 million viewers, easily winning the Block series (838 000) and TBL Familyes (726 000).
The Seven Channel had a double fate on the second night of the Chase Australia series.
Andrew O'Keefe's first half-hour (17-17.30) gathered 446 000 viewers on the average.
Another half hour (17.30-18) increased to 623,000 viewers - which was enough to win from Eddie McGuire Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night The Chase Australia’s first half-hour viewer averaged 520 000 audiences, and on the other half an hour, the number was 10,000.
The average of Hot Seat was 620 000.
The Chase Australia's second night's decrease in the average viewing value will give Nine channel confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 17.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute programme, which failed to reduce the number of viewers in the McGuire programme.

The final triangle agrees with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who wins the Bachelor series.
The identity of that woman has been kept extremely secret with which Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls certainly don't slip who got the last rose.
However, when we discussed with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could unintendedly give a clue about the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women were poemed when they told them how Wood was a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family dignity and positiveness as the causes of why they would like to be his partner.
However, when they were asked, "If Wood's last rose isn't for you, who should it be?", their answers could provide an explanation of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since the first day.
"Ever since I walked into the house, (Sarahin) energy and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind for the whole series," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really near the ground, and it's fun to be with him," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to have a nice and relaxed time together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize Wood could be "this right".
"When I saw her with my friends and my family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game, I am now in this with all my heart," she said.
When asked who Wood should choose if he didn't, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the remaining girls as much, so it's the same thing between Sneezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in his transformation into the United States, and many other teams have asked him after his impressive open practice day in the late of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers as well as coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to be a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne's replacement bank for the end of the game after this Australian Rugbyliga reciprocated the ball when he returned the first flight trap to the team when he won Minnesota on Tuesday, reading 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Haynen return the next flight trap and took her into the run game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real nature of Tomsula also appeared in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of barking up his newcomers into a battalion in front of the other team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a post-game press conference.
Special editor Cam Inman of 49ers reported that Haynea was also encouraged by the Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the fallout ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a plane trap that Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game.
This was certainly not the beginning of Hayne and her numerous Australian fans wished for a man's NFL-debyyt.
Haynen was seen on the way from the field after the drop, and later he told the Australian radio-parparent Hamish & Andy at 2DFM at 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"That was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game, and it's there," said Hayne.
Hayne compared his biting to its Original debut in 2007 when the input in his own target area led to Queensland goal.
In all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed on her Instagram account in a photograph with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and President of Russia Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss the rights of gay men
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun in threatening a Siberian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was in custody and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
Four men died while shooting rubber warriors against protesters in Nepal.
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in the Southern Nepal with a bunch of people fired from the police who expressed their minds against the country’s new constitutional proposal, the Authority reported on Wednesday.
Violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital of Katmandus.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior official in the area, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside the police station, and some of them were thrown stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used tear gas, and then he shot in the air before he went into the rubber bullets.
Twenty cops and five civilians got hurt, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber odours, which are known to be killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous option, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
In recent weeks of violent demonstrations, the assembly was across the southern plains of Nepal, where the members of the ethnic group named Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new Constitution weaken their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group demands its own country.
After 10 August, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, 11 of which have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after thousands of people were killed by the devastating earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted this week on the clauses of the constitutional text in Katmandusa, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could have been adopted by Sunday.
The NHC of the United States National Hurricane Centre says that in the south of Cap Verde there is a 60% chance of a roundstorm
On the top of the low pressure front, about 560 km south of the southernmost part of the Cape Verde island group, there is a 60% chance of developing into a tropical circulatory storm over the next 48 hours, the United States National Hurricane Centre reported on Tuesday.
The second vigilante low pressure front, located in the middle of the Cape Verde island group and the Little Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical roundstorm in the next two days, the weather forecast centre in Miami added.
Google starts a donation campaign with the aim of collecting 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign with the aim of collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees arriving in Europe when fleeing the war from the rifts and the poor countries.
Google had an exceptional personal viewpoint in publishing a donation campaign in his blog.
Instead of making the announcement a leader, the Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled with his family from Kabul when he was seven years old, wrote on his personal experience.
"Our journey was a number of dark train and bus trips, and hungry, thirsty, cold and dark," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But once the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations receive four non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save children and UN Refugee Commissioner.
Google told us that it corresponds to the same amount of every donation made on the Google.com/refugeeriel website on a global scale up to $5.5 million, with a total target of $11 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe is going on since the Second World War, which is mainly due to a civil war of four years in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many also flee from war raging Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Fatigue surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
The new study indicates that the benefits of digestion surgery for type 2 diabetics with mild overweight may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics are living longer after the fatigue surgery than those treated in other ways than in surgery.
"It takes a long time to get mortality data," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He's a digestive surgery expert who wrote a headline in a new research on JAMA Surgery.
In fatigue or bariatris surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach bag.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects involved have been sickly fat and have had 35 or more weight index (BMI).
BMI or weight ratio to length is considered normal when it is between 18,5 and 24,9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the person is over 30, he is considered to be overweight.
You can count your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers in the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatri surgery, gastric surgery and reduced gastrointestinal diabetic treatments with type 2 medicines in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the cuts fell from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI remained mostly the same in 29 of those who were treated with other means than surgery.
Of the cuts, 36% improved completely and 28% partially.
Due to comparison, in the medication group, diabetes improved by only 1% and partially by approximately 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the "blessed" LDL cholesterol "are generally better in the surgery group", the writers said.
Studies also observed patients’ blood haemoglobin levels of A1c reflecting blood glucose levels in the long term.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, researchers write.
The post-operative haemoglobin level fell from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, it remained stable in the treatment group at approximately 8%.
This better "glycematic control" described by improved levels of haemoglobin A1c, but did not reduce mortality over five years, says Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu's colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results between two types of surgery.
During the fifth year, when compared with the gastrointestinal surgery group, the gastrointestinal surgery group had dropped more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased its body weight index more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased the level of haemoglobin in the A1c (3.1% and 2.1%) and had more likely achieved a complete diabetes remission (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoneix Blackstone says that although the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden where surgery led to longer lives in more heavy people.
The Swedish study found that overweight fats undergoing weight loss had a lower chance of dying over a period of 15 years when compared with a group that had experimented with more traditional treatments.
Although the new study shows no improvement in the survival of surgery patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging individuals with a BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The results of the survey are crucial just because they show that the surgery is safe for the lower weight index group", he says, does not have an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when the patient is between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that will permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to withdraw the situation.
"Everyone cannot come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetan Buddhist has called for the stopping of violence in the home of refugees.
Dalai Lama dealt with the current refugee crisis in his speech, which he held at the openings of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain.
In the current situation, Dalai Lama claimed that all mankind’s needs should be put ahead of individual nations or even parts of the earth.
He also stressed that, although the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is also insufficient.
"Everyone cannot come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of a number of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime, we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslims, mainly through education.
The first thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of power has never solved these problems," he added.
When he took a position on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama commented also on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response of the United States caused severe events in the chain.
"After the 9/11-I gave my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was found through violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength, and it created unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
In the last four years, the ingestion of a hand-infiltration agent in children has increased to fourfold.
Infection data centres across the United States have reported a strong increase of almost 400% in swallowing alcoholic hand-infiltration agents for children under 12 years of age since 2010, says Georgia's poisoning information centre.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the director of Georgia’s poisoning information centre, the disinfection cases reported to the poisoning centres for children under 12 years of age increased from 326 cases in 2010 to 16117 cases in 2014.
"The children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them is due to the emergency police," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge of social media.
YouTube has videos where teenage people drink disinfectant to get a cheap rise.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed the disinfectant with alcoholic oral water to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant disinfectants can attract younger children.
"The kid doesn't think this is bad for him," said Lopez.
Many of the more interesting (manuscripts) are those to which the smell has been added.
There are disinfectants for strawberry, grape and orange, which are very attractive for children.
A hand disinfectant may contain any alcohol between 45% and 95%.
Especially small children need only a few injections for alcohol poisoning.
"It's a really concentrated alcohol," Mr Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 in Kansas City, the head of the hospital's poisoning information centre.
So you wouldn't leave the whiskey on the table, but the definitive substance will be left in sight, and if the children are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six - year - old girl who swallowed only four sprayed strawberries in her hands at school and was taken to the first aid.
The alcohol level in his blood was .179, which is twice the limit of the adult driving beverage, says Chris Ritchey, a first-aid clinic, who was treating the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
When Nhajah was talking, he couldn't walk when he arrived for the emergency.
The doctors followed him overnight in a separate children’s hospital in case of any symptoms of brain injury, because alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey told me.
"It was really scary," Nhaiah's mother, Ortoria Scott, said to CNN.
It could have been a deadly situation for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and move disinfectant away from children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some desinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women of Ontario died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing toxic, unannounced ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, declared as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of the state of New York, three fourth grades planned to poison their "good" teachers by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, reported in the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the hand disinfectant and denied it from his class.
The police need to prevent the plan as a "sustainable silence" and leave disciplinary measures to the school community.
Germmyly: There are no conflicts with Celtic
Well, Griffiths' talks about Celtic conflicts, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight place, but she's making it turn.
Hearts is fighting the Scottish Football Association for Neilson's charges, and Warburton is alert to the January recruitment that could disturb the team's unity.
Dons raised his lead to five points in Celtic.
The first half of Adam Rooney's sentence took Aberdeen into a narrow victory from Hamilton at the Pittodrien Stadium and allowed the team to increase the difference to five points in Celtic.
Griffiths deficiently speaks of conflicts.
There have been rumors of intra-Celtic conflicts, but Griffiths missed them immediately. He claims that he and his teammates do not have any sense of working under a more accurate surveillance when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are expecting to meet.
The lack of the Scotch championship bores the Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers average player and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition with Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said, "In Holland, we don't play the highlights of Celtic's games anymore, and why?"
Because Rangers isn't involved.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The games of these teams have a lot of tensions, and other than the Scottish people want to follow these games.
Deila swears to turn around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn the situation around.
The destruction of Malmöl and the fall of the Master's league resulted in a rapid loss of the ten men played in Aberdeen, which is now at the top of the series with the difference of five points to the next.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we will rise again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to go on.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton's precautionary for the January Player Transfers
Although Mr. Rangers-bom Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible game transfers in January, he is careful of the most recruitment, convincing that he would not want to confuse the team's consensus.
The former Brentford's boss said, "January's transfer window is very different from that of the summer window."
For the players to come in the summer, the time to adjust is the whole time ahead, which is reflected in our team for this period.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes increasing unnecessary players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest in Michu suggests that we are alive
The Swansea attacker Michu, whose name is attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has indicated that he can retire after his contract with Swans is terminated.
A 29-year-old player has had an ankle problems for two years, and during the summer he was unable to find a new company outside Wales.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish football alliance for Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team disappeared after this 3-2. The defendant's red card was later cancelled, and this was the third red card condemned by Collum in the last eight months, which was annulled.
Neilson stays behind his message saying, "I did not question honesty, I did not comment on the performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernian player was reprimanded when he gave up an insulting song about the former Hearts player Rudi Skakel.
The incident occurred in the pub at Roseburn, Edinburg, before Edinburg’s derbya at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
The attacker said, "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle, unless I go to Celtic."
Tannadice's government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the deterioration of the players has to stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
Donnelly says, "We're gonna get the boys back up."
McInnes happy for the "bleming victory" in the Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first half sentence, he succeeded in reaching his seventh success, which raised them five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, "There is no team that would have won anything, it was either a trophy or a too that would not have won the games in this way."
Scottish unemployment remains the same as the United Kingdom's overall rate
IN Scotland, 164 000 people remained in the period between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of Great Britain rose to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in the United Kingdom by 5.5 per cent, reported by the national statistical centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12 000 people over a period of three months, and the number of workers is now 2 612 000.
During the quarter, the employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 per cent, which is higher than the average in the United Kingdom by 73.5 per cent.
The Scottish State Secretary David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The long-term plan of governance is to build a foundation for a stronger economy."
Nearly a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
During these 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has declined.
Why am I witnessing execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, I'll see later today when a man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll sit in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary inmate when Richard Glossip is executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
In January, I received the request through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I've been starting to scare this day when it's approaching.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and because there are often more applications than free places, the participants will be selected through a scary value.
Oklahoma has reduced the locations for the media to twelve.
Whoever's chosen, look at what's going on cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to the closest friends of Richard Glossip, and I have also created my connection to him through the calls made over the months and a two- and a half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a reporter, so I can't have a notebook and a pen with me to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A Oklahoma journalist on Twitter accused me of my neutrality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants, and you'll be able to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admits that "you could have put your word better," but he still thinks that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and wrote.
He won't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it if he said it.
I've told him he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present, who writes about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help a trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post's reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcast broadcasts I've done.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't be sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, his actions would make him responsible for helping him.
But I believe there is a very strong chance that he hasn't committed murder.
I am sure that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And so this is the angle I look at him dying.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists around here who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of how it feels to watch the man I like dies unnecessaryly.
The man was lured out of the Canning River after a watery police hunt.
Canning Vale Officer remained dry when he lured a man out of the Canning River River.
A man from Perth attempted to distract the police from his stands when he found himself in a low, mud water just a metres away from a policeman who tried to "get him back gently on the beach".
Canning Vale police were invited to Beckenham on Tuesday because of the unauthorized invasion.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading to the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He stood in the water, saying, "I'm not coming out, come to pick me up," said senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: a good police conference.
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," said the senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master Football player Ben Cousins is an interesting example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim over the Swan River River.
He didn't succeed in his company, but he inspired the locals to start the playful design of the Ben Cousins Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the editors tried to spy on him and threaten to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's agents tried to infiltrate their vaults into his deposits last year, and threatens to stop competition immediately.
He blames the agents and the Racing Victorian Independence Division, claiming that they have a personal campaign running against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatai due to the treatment on the day of the race was the last thread.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for competition and that he has been in a difficult situation since Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue under control for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look jealous.
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it frustrates so much that everything goes out at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home today and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk upside down, and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best for them.
When they start to think differently, I don't have to go on coaching anymore.
Then I should consider what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview on the racing.com site, where he told me that the Independence Department had tried to spy on his stable.
"One and a half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in the room with a man, I'm calling him when he asks and offered him a job on my deposits if he communicates information about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a cheater.
If that's the case, they'd really want to separate their lawyers because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Modie, the current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I begin to think it's getting personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become male and perhaps to transfer responsibility to other coaches than to what is happening in the field?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that harmful to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Perhaps they have to take my license and push me away, and I do not doubt that it is what I'm saying now that they may not be able to think about that.
But I'm at the point now that I don't care anymore, and it's sad for me.
That really makes me sad.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The frustration of the coach has grown by a long-term Lidar cobalt study, and late rejection led him to the conclusion that he could "should throw his license over the table".
Moody, known best for the training of the invincible master Black Caviar, has called the rule of the day care measures for the race as "beautiful" after the mud or clay hatch has been placed on horse legs, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees made a mistake stabbing it into the leg.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have had it yesterday, just like it was.
It had it on the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month competition ban because of the day of the race, which was initiated by the operators.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
In Cobram, a driver convicted
The police have arrested a man who committed the escape after he hit a bike driver this weekend in Cobram.
The wheelchair was transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he had severe injury when the car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police told me that the driver drove away and didn't stop helping the injured bike.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia signed up to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, failing assistance and other traffic violations.
The bikeman, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, is still in the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Coach Craig Bellamy of the Melbourne Storm team attacks competitors on wrestling claims
Coach Craig Bellamy of Melbourne Storm has criticised the claims of two NRL-rugbyliga masters that his team's tacks would be part of the "line".
Constable Trent Robinson, Sydney Roosters, said that the separators allowed Storm to "press" on their own side when it suddenly won a final check in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos Coach Wayne Bennett barely hid his reference to the Storm after he won North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final checkout. Bennett called the game the "show window" of the rugby League and said that two of the Queensland teams weren't really excited about the "short" wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tacks and said they're just focusing on "contact" tacking.
Bellamy added that his trust was increased by two leading coach criticisms against Storm, because it means that they are afraid to lose to the team.
"This is always a talk... I couldn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost them 24-2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or technology throughout the year, and in the last six weeks, we have only emphasised the contact in tacks, and that has led us to success.
Trent's been on the team for three years, and he's obviously got a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, so this was a little shock for him.
It's funny how this is always going to happen at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "contemporary rugby" by reminding his mentor that St George Illawarra Dragons, trained by Bennett, won the championship in 2010 by playing "goodly".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He considered it important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember the 2010 criticism of St George that it is a boring team, and Wayne said that he couldn't care less.
But now he's got a team that can play a rugby that we think is exciting, especially when he has quick young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have its kind of players.
He brought that side up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I will be more confident when they say such things because they are a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think we were against the important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more pointier than it was played between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game must have been a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more, but is it an exciting rugby?
Or does it make it to break an exciting line of defense and not to paint?
For me, this is about directions.
If they mention us, that means we can play against them somewhere.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game either against North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night at the prefinal at AAMI Park. The tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
For the Serbian, 20,000 dollars for drug prosecution
A man who is threatened by a potential life-long life-long possession company of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggling to Queensland has been released against a guarantee of $20,000.
The 29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police had tracked 100 kilos of solay hunt, which came to South America through Vanuatu and was shipped to Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting other accused in the boatyard all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse Café, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although maximovic threatens a potential life-long business possession company for cocaine, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maksimovic tried to keep the entire amount and that he could be in the cafe for totally innocent reasons.
Peter Flanagan, Judge of the Supreme Court, was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
"He has close connections to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the Criminal Court, Maksimovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
The mother and stepfather of maximovic together offered a bail sum of $20,000 to ensure his release.
"After reading of the veiling certificates of both persons, it is clear that setting a guarantee of $20,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But alone it was not enough to prevent him from showing up before justice, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted guarantees under the condition that he delivers both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports daily to the police and holds his exit ban between six and six in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to attract pedofiels to send pictures
A pedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone when he fell asleep and then logged in to the online communication service where Hogg received a number of unbridled images of the children sent to him by another user.
She woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She searched her phone and found shocking messages, and then immediately she told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five pictures, searched the computers on the ground, and found "scaring" online searches with searches that were used to search for impregnant images taken from children.
After that, Hogg claimed to the police that he had done this to "screw pedophiles" on the Internet before he "presented himself to be a police officer to scare them."
Mr. Fiscal depute, Mrs Elidh Robertson, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court, "He said that this is an addiction - that he is dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had completed a grave on a computer but said that they were made only because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so that he could scare the pedofiels.
He was asked about discussions with an unknown person who sent him pictures and about how Hogg asked him to send additional photos.
Hogg said he did this only for bait purposes.
He said he was sick after he drank, and he wanted to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she yelled at her mother, she shivered and wept.
My mother saw the unwavering photos on the phone, and then she met the defendant.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the defendant had been using a computer and a Playtaton to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives in the Ward Road in Dundee, confessed to the accusation of preparing or taking pictures of unauthorised children on June 14th of last year.
The defense attorney, Gregor Sim, asked Hoggi not to be identified in the Sexual Criminal Register, for it could be claimed that his crime was not part of a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence to October in order to allow the social action to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was given guarantees in this case, but in other ongoing cases he has been arrested before the hearing.
He was added to the Sexual Criminal Register before the day of condemnation.
Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe, had the wrong speech to Parliament.
Mugabe, the oldest leader of Africa, fell earlier this year in the stairs leading to the talker's high school.
He didn't get hurt, but the video on the fall spread like the virus in the social media.
Parliament's openings were also struggling with the claims by the opposition's legislatures that they had been sent with anonymous murder threats to warn Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they bursted and interrupted him with intermediate calls when he held a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - which he said on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a group discipline supervisor of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones, which warned them not to interfere with Mugabe’s speech.
"The number from which the message was sent is not answering, but the message title is "death", Gonese told the journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that the immunity would cease to be in Parliament, and when they came out, parliamentary immunity was not valid.
The group clerk said that the party, chaired by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "intimidation" of threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has prepared to cut between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost cut-off efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP is divided into two listed companies, separated from the faster growing company equipment and services of computer and printer business.
The expected job cuts bring about $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, the HP newsletter.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, the President of HP and the CEO, who runs the unit after distribution.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current-HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that help companies move to a new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our chance to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be more than $50 billion, and it will "concentrate on producing non-inclusive integrated technology solutions" to companies, reported in the company's information sheet.
In the 1930s, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded a company from Stanford University to produce electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, called "Pilaakson's birth place".
HP has undergone a huge restructuring to overcome the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology figures in the United States, and its distribution is the most recent sector based on the belief that firms that are strictly limited are doing better.
Captain of Arsenal Mikel Arteta says teammates have to support the injured Jack Wilshera before the Dinamo Zagreb gamble.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September now, and assuming that he is going according to his plans, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire misses at least four of the next English games, and given her background, it is uncertain whether she participates in the European Championships next summer.
The biggest pity in this last problem is that the end of the last season of Wilshere was strong after a single ankle, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
"This is not the type of injury that threatens the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or past injuries that he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, the player trying to return to the middle of the way there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model in the formation.
The investigations of Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different disabilities since she debuted six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons, he has played Arsenal in 157 gala games in only 65 games.
In view of Arsenal's broader overall since 2007-08, for six from eight years, it has been one of the Valoliga teams who have lost the most days of the injury.
Wenger admits the chance of a witch, but Arsenal believes that their last season's improvement will continue in the disability statistics.
"Sometimes when you return from the injury can be a vulnerable season, in which you must strengthen the body and acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I am sure that this will happen, and that he will have a career that he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle its team when Arsenal starts his game of Master's League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, playing after Saturday on Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be at the initiative.
Wenger can also place Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in the place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep a balance and give a break to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear succession of the F-area, the maximum stadium in Zagreb is the scariest one in Europe.
Furthermore, Dinamo has not lost 41 matches since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
On Tuesday night, the Stadion was inclined by an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned from the recent season of the Master's league against Monaco, and he is still motivated by a distant dream that leads the team to the first victory of its Europe-Cup.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about male friendship
It is fascinating how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially in view of the need for men to open more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than for fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
The attempt to tackle the problem of Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the 2015 men for a year. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study included more than 2,000 high school and high-age students who showed symptoms of depression. The study showed that the chance of a person to recover doubled if a high percentage of his friends was "healthy".
Similarly, the probability of possible mental health problems in those who were not depressed was halved if they had healthy friends in mind.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this time of communication through social media, the style passes past content and the immediateness of the response is often more important than the relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, although in reality isolation is dominated.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All of this happens at the expense of our inner values - the personal growth and friendship of the inner craving - that affects our mental health more deeply.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money will certainly not gain greater happiness.
The fineness of the French was just that it turned this focus on its head.
No character was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which was clearly distinguished as friends in interacting.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, the moments in the comfortable chairs watching football, Ross longing for Rachel, their humor came out of the knowledge that yes, men can identify with all this, even though they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As the Samaritans Voluntary Worker explained to me: ..."when I listen to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have really understood how much the smallest interaction with a friend can improve feeling."
Often, men who contact us experience that they can't talk to friends.
The old idea of "overcoming" is strong, as well as the feeling that if problems are opened, it is seen as weak.
Frendit is one of the series that comes to mind when I'm trying to provide longer means of survival.
It highlighted the small moments of a relationship between men.
Although my neutral, external position on the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and a network of friends.

Di Maria makes a goal and helps the PSG hit Malmö's side
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made a paint in the league of Masters, helping the PSG pass the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Under the match report and the reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in the right direction when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their game in the Master's League with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö on Tuesday in Parc des Princes.
Di Maria made the Master's league in her debut less than four minutes, showing the way for the French leagues, but the team lost a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advances in Cavan's attack at the 61st minute.
Paris, which is in the same section A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish thief, because the game had not only a follow-up place but also an improvement in their quarterly games in the last three rounds of the game
But while the PSG took the points, it was not a classic game, because the Laurent Blanc team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost the place in front of the goal and later replaced the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his great career in 1999.
"Masters' League is not easy to win at home or in strangers, so the 2-0 win causes problems for the opponent and shows good in statistics, and there is a good start, even though there are things that we have to sneak in this season," Blanca said.
This anticipates good.
We wanted to win and win, even though I feel bad we didn't manage to do one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team in one of the three changes made after the team remained in the 2-2-stage League 1 home game against Bordeaux this weekend, but he remained in the fourth minute of Di Maria’s shadow.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentinian batter was named a man who takes the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he testified why when he ran into Marco Verratt's escort behind the Malmö defense line and then hit the beautiful final crossing of Johan Wland to the back of the network.
However, if someone expected a simple and big victory from the PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a blind opponent. It won Celtic in the final game, reaching this level, in its opening field there are nine international players and five men's defense and two players in the deep middle field.
But on the attack side, the team offered nothing but a shot of Nikola Djordjic at the 34th minute that went past the button of Kevin Trapp's goal.
On the other hand, due to the loss of the PSG and the poor finalisation, in particular Ibrahimovic, which failed in the five companies only in the first half of the time and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in the beginning of the second half of the period.
However, he was much more effective in doing pre-working to his colleagues, and Di Maria sent a tour strike on the course of Ibrahimovic’s feed, which was tied around Wiland’s goal to the 52th minute.
The second goal was finally achieved after an hour of the game, thanks to the sixth goal of the season, the Cavani of the province of the province of the province of the river, after Ibrahimovic had poured forward to the left of Maxwell’s crossing.
There was no end to Malmo's hopes to get back to the game, and only Wiland's great fight against the direct kick of David Luiz kept the end numbers down before Ezequiel Lavezz's goal was rejected at the end of the game.
The Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said, "The last game of the Master's league was last year in December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
It's not enough to fight.
I'm gonna lift my hat to Paris.
This was a great game for them.

Matt Damon is decreasing the difference in film work.
Matt Damon joined an African filmmaker, Effie Brown, when he talked about the difference that Damon said there was no need behind the cults.
The actor experienced at HBO's Sunday evening Project Greenlight episode interrupted Brown by highlighting the need for different perspectives as to the dark head of the project's selected manuscript.
"When we're talking about differences, it's taken into account when choosing actors for a movie, not a series," said Damon.
The shocked Brown reacted in disloyally to the injured person, the comments "Oh! Wow. Okay", while The Martian actor's comments fell into the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss a series of finalists.
"I want to urge people to think about whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony's personality," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark character is the whore that his white pimp beats.
The Dear White People producer demanded the rights to direct the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Bracacccio; Damon hardly replied that their guidance "can end up giving us something we don't want."
After the debate was sent, the social media exploded to spoil Damon's comments.
The Twitter user MrPoon expressed his anger for the film play, writing: "Matt Damon talks to the only dark person in the room and explaining to him the difference is THINK OF THROUGH that happens."
After his publication, Twittius collected more than 5,000 retwistings and 4000 fans.
Damon's comments come at a time when a precise breeding presentation in the media is in the field of social debate.
After the white police killed Michael Brown of the teenage age in 2014, The Black Lives Matter spread into a countrywide and called on legislators and authorities to stop discriminating practices against coloured people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the issue when presenting the Year's album candidates to be awarded the Grammy Prize.
"The Albume are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The heads of the Black Lives Matter movement recently published a statement to answer the question of Mr Elisabeth Hasselbeck as a group of hatreds.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," said the leaders.
It was recently reported that Damon was involved among the entertainment, producers and media mogules who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or already met the Pope.
The First American Ninja Warrior Master Crowned
On Monday, Isaac Caldiero, a professional club player and dishman, became the first athlete who won the American Ninja Warrior competition and received a million dollars of the prize.
There has never been a competitor in the competition programme that has just ended the seventh period, who would have survived all parts of the blocking path of the programme.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and the cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
The last mission had to climb a 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge in time, which led him to become the first athlete of all times, who discovered American Ninja Warrior's exhausting 4th part. However, Caldiero discovered the challenge three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
Caldiero gave E!News an interview after a difficult victory and was still shocked to win a million dollars' principal prize.
"That's a great thing to think when I've never earned or lived as much as $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So suddenly... I can't even imagine what this will be like... the future is unknown.
Kent Weed, Director of Production, sat down to discuss the Hollywood Reporter's branch and why Britten can't get more reward money, even though he's the first competitor of all times who has managed to cross the track.
The rules are that the money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money will be given to the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Though money is a great reward and a change in life, he still gains great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels bad about that.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family father.
He's the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I believe Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, whose descriptions start in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak Minnesota past Twins
The second half of the season has not been very funny for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers used to be one of the best baseball teams, but now he's the last of the American League Central division.
Tigers played his role perfectly on Tuesday when he won Minnesota on Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the opportunity to get up halfway from Houston Astros in a competition from another American League wild card.
For Detroit the game was at least one night returning to the six-letter H word, which had been very difficult to reach the most of the last half of the season.
"All profits are fun, no matter how they get them," said Brad Ausmus, team leader of Tigers.
The feeder of Tigers, Alfredo Simon, continued his early support for the attack when Detroit ran three times in the first two pairs, and then once again in the sixth and the nineth.
Simon (13-9) baited 6 1/3 in pairs and released three runs.
This was just his third quality initial in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for a changeman to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Victor Martinez, the Vice-President of Tigers, hit three times and allowed two runs that were his first hit after mid-August.
This was the first night of Martinez’s three strikes after he hit four times against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He's got a good taste," says Ausmus.
He looked good (shooting exercises), seemed considerably better in the punching exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind the seventh shift in the latter half, and it was their best chance to get back to the game.
Center Byron Buxton started the shifting couple by twice pulling out the left field line.
Aaron Hicks, on the right side, came home with one nest, and Simon got burned directly to another nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to a left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy was walking on Mauer, the only player who stood up against him, Miguel Sana, who started the first, pulling two nests from the right-hand Drew VerHagen.
When two runners were on the field and a smooth runner on the second base, VerHagen had a three-bed Trevor Pluffe hit a double-player landing night.
This was a record of the main series: 27 times this season when Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit had received a securitisation drink at the beginning of the nineth, Maurer pulled two beaten runs against the Tigers locker Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned in three feeds on the fifth in his salvation.
Detroit used Phil Hughes in rust at the beginning.
Tigers got three runs in the first two ranks against the right-hand veteran player, who got out of the list of injured before the game after being out of bed for more than a month due to the inflammation of the underback.
"It's obvious that I didn't want this beginning," said Hughes, "but when I went on the game, I felt more comfortable, and I felt that I was able to make a few nice inputs on the third round."
After Hughes captured the starter's first nest, he gave another nest player Ian Kinsler to proceed between one.
The walk of J.D. Martinez on the right side of the two fires brought Victor Martinez to the strike, who took himself to the middle floor and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 pipe while the runners were in good runway positions.
Nick Castellanos, a three - leg player, continued by kicking right and causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned trying to move on to the third base.
Tigers continued on the other side and received one fire, two nests in the situation of the abductor James McCann and two fires, one nest, running a center of Anthony Goselta, and then the situation was three-0.
"It was a big hit," said Paul Molitor, team leader of Twins.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right place.
Hughes began to be in the input locks and baited the 3rd runless pair, after which he became the right-handed successor A.J. Achter.
For Hughes, three runs from six hits and a walk with four fires.
OPINION: Anibal Sanchez, the right-handed feeder of Tigers, was thrown out of his shoulder because of the sleeve.
He's being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured since mid-August because of the shoulder cliff, but he had to return on Wednesday.
When Sanchez's out there, the left-hand baiter Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris' statistics at Tigers are 1-1 in four initiatives after David Price, the left-hand bait, was switched to him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20, because of the right swinging of the abdomen muscle.
The three-game series of Tigers and Twins will end on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) is positioned against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) from Minnesota's right-hand feeder.
Xi urges to open the economy more widely to the world
The economy must be more open to the outside world to promote growth, and President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday to guide the reform.
"Kinda should be committed to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a transparency policy," he said in his speech at the 16th meeting of the group leading to a deepening of the general reform.
Support for transparency while reforms are being driven forward with more new movements and vitality, and create new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The Management Group approved a series of guidelines including a negative list of market access restrictions, a reduction in border control principles, a call for private capital to be taken by state-owned companies, and a review of the registration system for residents.
The opinion suggests that a negative list will be created identifying the sectors and companies in which no investment is allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through experimental programmes.
The change is significant, since it plays a greater role for the market in the allocation of resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government will also veil its governance into the power that it distributes to businesses, thereby ensuring that companies decide themselves how to manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for regional growth.
Opening public sector sectors to private donors opens more sectors.
"Government does not change its approach to foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the opinion.
In addition, the search process for permanent residential permits for foreigners, "green cards", will be facilitated by optimising the requirements and reducing the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the professional training rights of lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as the senior leaders, Liu Yunsha and Zhang Gaoli, and reported in a opinion published after the meeting.
