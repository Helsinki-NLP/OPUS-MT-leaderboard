Four members of the Kemerovo Group were held in Estonia and Spain
According to the postman, the police arrested Slava Gulevich, head of the so-called Kemerovo group in the Estonian sub-world, known as Slava Kemerovski in a criminal world.
Gulevitš was arrested in Spain with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the Court also arrested three suspects in Estonia.
The suspicion is that the so-called members of the Kemerovo Criminal Society are 27-57 years old, who mainly commit drug crimes.
In Miias, Malaga, Spain, the alleged leader of the criminal community was arrested.
Three men were held as suspects in Estonia, one of them was collected according to the data as a leader of a criminal community and two are members of a criminal community.
The data collected indicate that a criminal community had clearly allocated tasks and roles.
The aim of the criminal community was to commit drug crimes and thus earn criminal income", commented the head of the criminal pre-trial proceedings, prosecutor Vauur Verte.
"We do not preclude the increasing circle of suspects in this criminal case," added the prosecutor.
It is a group of people who have been involved in the interest of law enforcement authorities in the past, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become normal for us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," commented the prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said that a pre-experience of almost a year and a half of the detentions had preceded.
"In the first half of the vision, long-term work has become real and we have held suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time," he said.
He added that the Central Criminal Police officials assisted in detention in Spain.
For years, we have good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civilian cards.
These detentions are another message for criminals to get them from another end of Europe," Leis said.
The information collected so far indicates unequivocally that, while presenting freedom, suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, so the prosecution requested their arrest and approved it.
A man arrested in Spain awaits his transfer to Estonia.
In the context of this criminal case, real estate, vehicles and cash are under arrest to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings shall be conducted by the Central Criminal Police Office for organised crimes and led by the State Prosecutor.
The City Court of Tallinn condemned Slava Gulevitshi in 2005 for extortion and punished him with five years of imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevitschi was considered to be the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after the underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, emerged in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to deal with extortions in Tallinn.
He claimed to be taxing taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and demanding a monthly roof tax on businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal income and enforced judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the final judgments, eight accused of the so-called Dikajev Criminal case, of which criminal income was confiscated by EUR 80 000, or against nine persons, that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illicit trafficking of smuggling cigarettes and the prosecution of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in East Viruland and South Estonia.
The confiscated criminal income is approximately EUR 71 500.
In these criminal cases, it has been a success that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, actions are carried out together in any country of the European Union.
The Civil Rights Group warns against traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned people traveling to Missouri against discriminating policies and racist attacks in the state.
The statement of the Group states: "The NAACP travel note issued for the State of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American passengers, visitors and the Missourians to be particularly observant and extremely cautious as they travel throughout the state, taking into account the suspicious racial events of the whole race, which have recently been held over the state and have been published here."
According to the NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning, both by the recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to win discrimination cases, and by the fact that the target of state law defenders is inequally the minorities.
"The citizens' rights are being violated.
They are drawn to the side of the road due to their skin color, beaten or killed," said the president of the NAACP Missouri, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We've never had so close complaints before."
This is the first warning that the organisation has issued for the State of the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist insults by black students at Missouri University and the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances after he ran through the state of the gas, and the Missouri police arrested him without being accused of a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Prime Prosecutor of Missouri, which indicates that in the state, black drivers will be stopped by 75% more likely than those of the whites.
"The note is designed to make people aware and warn your families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"The people need to be prepared, whether it means bringing bail or informing their relatives that they pass through the state."
On the basis of the latest information on the FBI's hate crimes programme, 100 hatred crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, which will place the state on the 16th place in relation to the number of similar offences.
The travel warning also responds to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult to appeal to the company for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union ACLU) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after these States adopted immigration laws which oblige local people to arrest against immigration violations because, according to ACLU, it increases racial profile.
Usually, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue travel warnings for other countries, but lately interested groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the various forms of this severe illness?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, may be caused by five different hepatitis viruses - A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, with a low-natural cost, there is chronic hepatitis B and C, which may continue to develop into cirrhosis in the liver, i.e. liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
The epidemiology adviser of the Health Service, Kuto Kutsar, reports that the signs of acute hepatitis are similar for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey faeces, dark urine, muscle and joint pain and yellowness of skin and mucous tissues.
The last sign of the disease also originates in the generic name of liver inflammation yellow fever.
In children, hepatitis may occur without signs of illness.
Different types of liver inflammation can only be identified based on laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can pass into chronic hepatitis and go for decades without signs of illness, which means that a person may not know anything about his or her harmful liver disease.
Kutsar describes different forms of hepatitis and their progress more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us with contaminated food or water, sex, deficiency of the infected person to the hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, mouth contacts and drug consumption.
The risk or risk group of hepatitis is family members and caregivers, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with the infected, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travellers visiting countries with a high spread of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular for highly travellers and those who are at risk with hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene requirements are important: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before eating for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread in contact with the blood of a patient, injecting drugs, tattooing, inleting, using blood-contaminated predominants (toothburns, racing devices), in donor blood, in sex with a person suspected of hepatitis, and from an hepatitis patient to a foetus/antibodies.
The risk group for hepatitis B includes injecting drug addicts, sex partners of infected person, men having sex with men, newly born mothers and nurses, health, rescue workers and police officers who are exposed to blood and other physical fluids, and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis B disease.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended that people in the risk group be vaccinated and people with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other prevention measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygienic and manicure devices, other sharp devices and syringe needles, tattooing and leakage, and the use of condoms in case of infectious sex or preventing sexual risk.
The vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan and free of charge for children in Estonia.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread in contact with sick people's blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, inleting, using blood-contaminated predominantly, donor blood, sex with a person who is susceptible, and from an hepatitis patient to a foetus/antibodies.
The risk group for hepatitis C involves injecting drug addicts, sex partners of infected person, men having sex with men, newly born mothers and caregivers, health, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other physical fluids, passengers with HIV infection and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis C disease.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: avoidance of the use of foreign hygienic and manicure devices, other sharp devices and syringe needles, tattooing and leakage and the use of condoms in the case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
D Hepatitis is caused by hepatitis D virus that multiplies in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection is associated with hepatitis B or superinfected in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
The hepatitis D viruses are spread by contact with blood and other physical fluids, with the injection needles contaminated with them, sexually and from the male foetus rarely infected.
The risk group of hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have hepatitis B immunity.
Effective prevention is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects the person from infection with hepatitis D virus.
E hepatitis viruses spread by fecal-oral route with drinking water and food, including low heat-treated meat, fish and carcases, donor blood, commonly used syringes and infected mothers to foetus.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with high disease.
The prevention measures for this hepatitis are to comply with the hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after care of the patient.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid a small amount of hot-treated beef, fish and marine food, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
Although in the last round, competitors tried to pull the four-fold Olympic winner off the track, the 34-year-old Farah found power on the end of the world and won by the time 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long after pulling the finish with him his wife, Tania, and the children.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
Being along with them was wonderful," said Farah to the journalists.
Farah is targeting the fifth title competition in London for a golden double running of 5000 and 10,000 metres.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait, is diving into much deeper than the story of the birth of a art act in the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century into Vienna's cultural life.
But it's even more in-depth history.
A fearful amount of information would have been lost, or a harder cut-off, and a narrower theme would have been hit by the extraordinary story of the portrait allowed in the title.
At present, it would be like two books between the covers: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, represented by Gustav Klimt and his painting "Daam in Gold", and a much larger and wider history book of respected Jewish families and German occupation, along with its consequences in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of the burst, and who has come to the capital of Austria, can hardly imagine how much more than a hundred years ago life went to Ringstra, or how all the heads of the Central Café were turned when Klimt came in.
The concentration of cultural characters in one of Europe’s richer cities was high, and when you see a name in the book, you feel a little more cultural.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city where the unhealthy syphilis was and the highest level of suicide in Europe, it seems that the story does not add to development.
Or, perhaps, each pair-suspensioned coating also adds colors to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of travel to the Soviet Union
During the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had risen explosions, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
During the century, almost every ten inhabitants of Vienna were Jewish.
Adele’s parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice the old Czech sugar magnet Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt posed for her famous paintings, her father’s bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But the whole glamorous life she belonged to, Adele didn't draw.
If you look at "Dam in Gold", it's hard to believe that at the end of life this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
In 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his wife’s portrait from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
At that time, Klimt order paid 4000 kroons, a quarter of the price of the landhouse.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of the master's love story with the model was not deteriorating the sugar magnet.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist created during the work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor, "Dam's gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait is an extraordinary story", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before the beginning of the work with Adele, Klimt had visited Ravenna in the basilica of San Vitale, and researchers believe that the glorious mosaics that were seen there, from Theodora, gave the artist the idea to make a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
The Klimt introduced his "Dam Gold" in Vienna in 1908 and about the same time (in 1907-1908) was born another golden land "Sweed".
The similarities of the two women were not overlooked by the artistic history.
What does Hitler have to do with the story?
"To remember my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his handwork available to the public," wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had completed another portrait from Adele.
In his will (February 1925) Adele also asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes to Austrian Gallery.
His jewelry was surrendered to his niece Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had finished "Austria Mona Lisa", he had tried to enter the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, 17 years old Adolf Hitler, but failed to draw.
Although Hitler’s later antisemitism is sometimes considered because he was not accepted by the Jewish professors at the academy, none of his examiners was actually Jewish.
In any case, the mission of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in Maria’s will in 1939, had become significant -- the discovery of the lavish Jewish art collections in Vienna for the Nazi Party.
Hitler’s personal art reserve was also suitable for some of the work at Adele’s home, but not for Clint’s.
Sixty years after the Nazi artistic robbery, a ten-year litigation between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs began.
Let's just say that if "Sweed" sees the Belvedere castle in Vienna, the "Dam Gold" representing Adele Bloch-Bauer must be seen on a trip to New York Neue Gallery.
And before we go to Vienna, we read the book mentioned above.
Even if you didn't plan to go to the work of Klimt, because at least my emotions, after closing the book, turned more Nazi and Jewish theme than the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for $ 135 million.
So not as much a portrait as a family's fate and a very touching story.
The Bauer’s family tree at the beginning of the book made an extraordinary contribution to the orientation of events.
A 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
Gold’s life was very close to his 200-mile own personal record swimming 2.16.62.
The tipmark comes from the 17-year-old picnic from the first week of the Canadian June Ori championships at 2.16.58, the Priit Aevangean Swimming Blog.
Gold was the last one, maybe the tenth of the A-final.
In the final, he passed the distance from 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful mark.
The Estonian record of Alina Kendzior (2.15.13) remained a little more than half a second apart from Gold.
Gold was the third of all in Estonia, and his fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of all the time in Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still starting 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in freeness and 200 m and 400 m in complexity at the Canadian Volunteer Championships.
Last week, the June Canadese Championships in Toronto took place, and Gold also made successful starts there.
He won 200 metres in free circulation in the time of the silver medal 2.03.22.
This was so fast floated by this distance Estonians last year in 2008.
Over the years, only the Estonian record lady Elina Partika has swimn in Estonia.
A Estonian woman living in Canada won a bronxmedaille 100 m of free movement with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season's top mark on 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, one year older than him, has swept this distance just one century faster.
He reached the top of his personal mark when he received another 100 m in his backlight, in the opening exchange of the message of drowning, at the time of 1.03.69.
On half a long distance, he only reached the seventh place when he swimd at the final 2.17.31.
Gold is currently in charge of the Estonian season's vocabulary on four different distances.
President Trump is going on vacation, critics sharpen the teeth.
It's time for vacations - that means relaxing the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has so far been one of the most absent presidential holidays, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president plans to spend a 17-day vacation at a own-named golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's vacation started yesterday, Trump's opponents have already spoken for a week.
They're throwing too much rest on Trump.
It's a custom for the president to spend weekends in his villa in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most resting president during his 196 days.
For example, George W. Bush was able to spend 67 days on vacation, but Barack Obama was half less than Trump, but only 21 days.
But Trump tends to forget things fast.
Reading days after becoming president Trump said "60 minutes" in the show that there was no time left for long rest during his nurse, because a lot of work needs to be done.
He also made three years ago annoying about Barack Obama's vacation.
The current president wrote on Twitter: "When Obama is on vacation, plays golf, attends parties and jazz concerts, the ISIS journalists cut their heads off."
According to the White House officials, there's not really a 17-day golf club visit.
It is officially called a work holiday during which Trump has no time for reading or other pleasure activities.
In addition, work leave had to have another reason.
In the West of the White House, the conditioning system will be replaced, and therefore the entire staff had to leave.
Ovalkabinet and other presidential offices are also located in the west wing.
"I don't think that any of you would like to be in the west wing in August, if there are 38 degrees and there is no conditioner," said the White House speaker Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue to work on holidays.
Where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you'll know about the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook Do not apply to the State Office if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew so much about the disadvantaged media outbreak.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long in the newspapers to get him to fuck up for everything from internal policy to his political principles.
Of course, he was upset by criticism.
But he didn't force his critics to shut up.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of speech could be taken away from us, and we could be led, like sheep, in silence. "
It brings me to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who has to work harder to be more like Washington.
Hogan subordinates have blocked and deleted at least 450 people's posts who published their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU was therefore sued.
The Governor's staff stamped the action for nothing, and the web commentaries were about the repetitions in the style "Who cares?".
"It's just Facebook," said many.
But it does.
And it really counts when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
The percentage of his acceptance is in the second place among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan's not an unintelligent reactionary moodhead.
He has led the state on a firm hand and has remained firm in his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his constituents quite well, for example, for the first time after chemotherapy, his squirrel head.
Thus, the Governor's website, which is a public forum with official labelled, is managed by blocking persons who are paid by taxpayers’ dollars and are indispensable and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's press representative, Amelia Chasse, defended the conduct of the governor's interview with the Washington Post, claiming that blocking comments was nothing but a moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of Internet trolls, spam mailers or people full of hatred.
The Post was talking to a lot of real people Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they're real people who're dealing with their chosen leaders, teacher, company owner and pastor, not online roles.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not rude.
In his post, the pastor quoted the Bible by pressing Hogan’s Catholicism.
A lawyer from Maryland's Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Raman was not annoying anger, but a real crime of hatred.
"I politely congratulated that I was disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote The Post news in the commentary report.
"I also do not like the idea that, if many people comment on the same subject, some will immediately call it collective effort, rather than admit that this is a great deal of concern for citizens."
What the Governor's officials called a "directed spam attack", others would probably call "official support".
The Facebook era allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than before when workers had to be sent out to do the same, so that they could collect and burn newspapers with critical guidance, or arrest protesters, and force them to shut up.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official criticised for making Facebook and other social media channels toothless.
President Trump has sued the Twitter users who are blocked from his Twitter stream.
One of the first marking judgments on this issue was held last week in Virginia.
The United States District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria decided that the president of the Loudouun County Supervisory Board violated the first revision of the Constitution when he blocked the voter on his Facebook page.
Kentuckys also visited the Governor Matt Bevini (R) for the use of ACLU Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington’s time, affordable postal costs had a similar impact as on the Internet.
In the range between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers twisted his way of conduct.
And even then, Washington had to pour on an anonymous trolley.
People wrote letters to newspapers from pseudonims such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents gathered in the context of the online George Washington letter collection project, his office was buried under petitions, which criticised his views regarding the friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't force them to shut up.
Freedom of expression, differences and discussions are the foundations of our country.
And the right management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of homeland at the Renaissance Club
For the next three days, Ronan Rafferty's former European frontal number hopes for the comfort of the homeland when the East Lothian Renaissance Club takes place on the golf courses of 25. Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irish, who was leading the last round before Paul Eales underwent on the tracks of Archerfield Links, last year, is fond of the new location of the event and is a member of the club’s founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvad.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we'll see how the club will shine with this event in full glory," said Rafferty.
"The musicians see the path in their best form, it's in a glorious state.
Jerry's done a great job in setting up this place.
He's an enthusiastic supporter of the golf game, and he's proud of what he's achieved here.
It allows you to introduce the track perfectly."
An Englishman Eales is looking forward to the first time he can protect the championship, although he has won both on the European Tour and on the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year-old career.
"It sends a very special feeling," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't protect my Extremadura Open's title because it was taken out of my victory competition a year later.
It's magical to come back to this place.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, and for me and my wife, Sharon, last year was a special victory.
It was a very special time for us to carry in our hearts forever."
On the ground of the country again, Gary Orr, who joined the European tour of the Seniors in the beginning of the year when he received 50.
This is his first event in Scotland after his participation in Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"The home to play is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburgh Man Orr.
"You want to play well, but you feel the extra tension.
I've enjoyed playing the game again a lot, and I've shown you a pretty good golf game.
I'm happy with the way things went so far."
Ian Woosnam, former Masters tournament winner, and Senior Tourists, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James, Mark McNulty.
The Orr and former Captain of Ryder's Cup Sam Torrance are two of the six Scotches in the race fire, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmair and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, and parking costs 5 pounds for one passenger and 10 pounds for a car with two or more passengers.
All revenues go to the charity organization Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in a Golden Land in Indonesia
When Bardina Degei makes dinner, she won't use the stove.
He doesn't even use a pot.
In the wooden cabin in Enarot, the capital of the Paniai district of Papua, Indonesia, the housewoman puts the batad called nota in the local language directly to the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charcoal is taken from the fire and washed the skin with the unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on the soil floor with no furniture, and there she does her daily homework, such as washing washing washing with cloudy water from the nearby family.
The house is filled with an emmer in a room without a roof.
Since she is the youngest of four women of her husband, she is not assigned to take care of any field.
Polygamia is common here.
But late work can be dangerous for most of the village men to be unemployed, and many of them drink hard, and there are still soldiers here.
"No one will dare to visit the village after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare look at life in Papua Highland. It is a former Dutch colony, which was joined in Indonesia in 1969, after a conflict-producing referendum, which forced only 1026 old men to vote in the eyes of the occupational forces.
The movement that encouraged the release of the Dutch sovereignty moved its rage against the government of Jakarta, which continues to keep the region under strong control by keeping away from external journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, so that the independent Papua New Guinea stayed in the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a distant and abandoned place. To get here, you must fly from the capital of the province of Jayapura for 90 minutes to Nabire and then pass a five-hour trip to the rental car.
There is no common transport.
A city with about 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo sticks and covered by wavelength iron roofs, which have been transformed by rust into yellow browns.
Very few Indonesians have traveled here, not to mention journalists, as well as almost no foreigners have been here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuas of Mee Pago worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to the turban, the dark blouse and the bright skirt of our colorful handwear.
"Before we wore it on the body, we only wore leaves of plants."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty limit, and the statistics on infant mortality and innocentness are one of the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden land.
Just 100 km from Panama, which is about 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world is Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport was mineing here about USD 3.1 billion of gold and copper.
Furthermore, Papua can be proud of consumer wood stocks, which are estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are the source of Papua’s suffering, as they result in the stifling presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A study in the New York Times 2005 showed that Freeport paid some USD 20 million to local military and military units from 1998 to 2004, including up to USD 150 000 to one officer.
The Papuas’ efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden cane and will be omitted ungratefully.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 Papuas have been killed since 1969, and thousands of others have raped, tortured and imprisoned by Indonesian troops.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massive killing of genocide in the 1970s of the Papua tribes was measured.
Last year alone, more than 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested in the Indonesian police area.
The 2016 report of the Aartsbishop of Birsbane "We are losing all" contains statements of cruelty committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (one second report indicates that rape and shocks are particularly common) and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"The number of officers is difficult to count as such incidents take place every week," says the organization Human Rights Watch Indonesian investigator Andreas Harsono.
The shrimps are even more tightened, as Papua’s natural resources have caused the influencing of new residents from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but the demographic is changing because of the mosle economic migrations from the population of Indonesia, Java, Calimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes.
Java's family dishes sell a gado-gado with chicken and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local beans," explains the 24-year-old Abeth You, born in Panama, who moved to Jayapura, the capital of the Province for work.
"Polish Papuas Papua Mama-ma'd [women] will therefore lose their market share."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, known as the people Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter won on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace in the 29 constituents of Papua, including Paniai.
But Papua has become very little, and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted by Jokow in the expectation that he will meet our hopes of restoring justice," says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokow came to office, Paniai was in a low level.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotalis sang Christmas songs when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from darkness.
The older children told them to turn the front lights on.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers fell on their voice tone and returned later with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, drunk soldiers chased the children and beat them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot among the children.
One child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yemo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby electoral committee building was burned, and the next day things became even more escalated.
Approximately 1,000 young men, women and children of Papua gathered for justice in the football field ahead of the local police station and the military control center.
They carried ceremonial huntings and presented the waita dance of the Papua pago tribe, where they were running around and imitating bird songs.
Some protesters started to rock on the police and the military.
In the aggression, soldiers were sent through the interior radio. "If the mass is more than three times resisting, shoot them," said the official document that the magazine TIME has seen but has not been published in local media publications.
Yeremémis Kayame (56), the senior of Kego Koto, the town of Enarothal, felt a threat and called on the people to go home to preserve peace.
No one wanted to listen.
"When he turned around, I was shot in the left wrist suddenly," he said to the magazine TIM in his bright colors on the wooden house's veranda.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the rifts of the gathered soldiers.
"There was a lot of money, avenged a lot of shots," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was shot three times, according to his nephew.
"I drank to him and looked through his body to make sure it was him," said the magazine Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... kissed him."
Chief Inspector Yotje Mende of Papua Police told the reporters that he would only return to the security of his department because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when we are threatened to be killed," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, Press Representative of Papua Police in 2015.
"This is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and had a lot of injury.
The news about killings just got to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapura had a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy to the families of the victims and allowed them to deal with abuses in Papua.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Mr Wiranto, said that he would establish an external mechanism for tackling crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, the apologies followed.
"The most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we need to follow certain processes," he said.
Speaking with the magazine on 5 June in Jakarta, Wianto took his words back, saying that he had no intention of establishing a mechanism for dealing with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All things are settled according to the law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the bloody independence reference in 1999, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Papua, including those in Panama.
The families of the victims of Panama received such claims with a sorrow.
"I have been questioned four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later he's still living in a scary way.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the army's gonna arrest me, I'm afraid I'm gonna be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view that the people of Paniah are afraid to deal with this incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after he had helped him bury four victims.
"After the burying of the dead, the army came to seek me," he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired villagers in the Paniai neighbourhood in Deiya.
One person died and 17 wounded, including children, when he went into a battle between the villagers and the head of the construction company who refused to carry an unconscious man to the hospital.
That male man, the 24 - year - old Ravianus Douw, who drowned fishing for a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers smashed the cops with stones on which the latter responded with warning bills.
But the local claim was that the mobile brigade (Indonesia military police) started shooting on the people by killing one person.
"We were in a lot of panic, fearing revenge," said the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lived near the hospital and saw the injuries from the entry.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of involved police officers and the withdrawal of a mobile police brigade from the region.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia.
The absence of the planned development will feed the dissatisfaction of the Papua-growing middle hills of honey, many, Dan and damal tribes.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL), which, according to themselves, protects the rights of Papuas by occasional assaults and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders are from Panama, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the Army has arrested and imprisoned thousands of people over the past years under the pretext of "protection of the sovereignty of the state".
Some of them never show up again.
Among Papua people, Paniai is known as a "tracist forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
A small amount of rice sold in Enarotalis is too expensive to buy for the locals.
The bread is the same as unavailable.
People grow all their food themselves mainly by batata, in addition to a little fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five batad fields.
They usually keep most of their harvests to the family, and the rest they sell on the local market.
Ten batteries only cost 10 000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequalities between the indigenous Pappas and the new migrants, which have already arrived since the opening of new airlines at Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist are going better to educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuas themselves often lack the capital or the skills needed to conduct a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs and no money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai tribes Council.
The separation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition, foreign media will be subject to severe restrictions.
In the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were sent out of Papua because "they did not follow appropriate practices," although they had been granted a rare filming permit.
According to Vice-President of the Human Rights Watchi Asian Department, Phelim Kine, the election pledges of Jokow have not been implemented to remove the restrictions imposed on reporters to promote transparency and development.
"In Indonesia journalists trying to make reports from the easternmost restless provinces of Papua and Western Papua threaten new threats to reject visas and to carry a black list," he said in his statement.
The lack of a cage view in the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to the nearest neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States were encouraged by Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands to explore the United Nations Human Rights Council in Papua, including the shooting of Panama.
The same countries have also historically supported the VPL.
The press representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the allegations of the group, saying to the journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia is still subject to democratic orders and freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to bury the evidence of cases against human rights."
Local people want more foreign governments to be noticed.
When the Dutch official delegation visited Jayapura on 4 May with the State's Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Bar, the local people who attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous, according to the source of their silence, asking, "We want freedom."
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but Papuas do not believe that they will vote for Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai Chairman of the tribes Council.
He wants to tell Jokow that, in addition to the constant threat of predators' army, the people of Paniah are suffering from nigga education and health.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniah, as well as the other Papuas, consider their vote to Jokow to be a debt that he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniah shooting victims were able to deal with the last symbolic rebel they buried one of the victims in the land against the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be set up, at least those responsible will not let them forget their crimes.
"One of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his lower head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire swallowed the Dubai Torch cloudscraper for the second time.
Fire flew through one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forced hundreds of inhabitants to escape from this building 337 metres high and 79 floors.
This is another fire that has destroyed a high building in just two years, which happens to be called Torch.
The building was evacuated, no injury was reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up on fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," told Reuters, a resident who called himself George.
According to the Dubai Civil Protection Officers, the fire was erased by firefighters at about 4 a.m. in the morning by local time (0.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to secure shelter for the victims.
This incident can raise questions about the safety of materials used on the external surface of high structures worldwide.
In the investigation conducted after the fire in 2015, Torch Board found that fascinating panels and isolation of the external surface were the most damaged.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation and fascade panels of the Grenfel Tower in London could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in June, where about 80 people died.
Look, these phones are probably selling buildings in the autumn.
Spring and autumn is a sweet time for tech fans because then phone manufacturers will publish their new top models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came to sale, also in the autumn there are new hit phones for shoppers.
According to the Tele2 Marketing and Sales Director Kristjan Seema, this year’s flagships are characterised by an innovative design, an eyeliner scanner, a screen with a 4K resolution and a superspeed processor.
Samsung Galaxy S8 in the technology world, which has also reached the front of the Estonian smartphone sales table.
In the autumn, smarteners are allowed to be more exposed to high-speed loading, a more durable battery, a more high-quality camera and increased water and dust security.
He added that on the basis of the rumours, you can already make assumptions and predict the four top models that would probably take over the sales forwards of the year.
These four smart phone top models reach the shoppers in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the stores already in the middle of September.
The rumours, but what the new Apple model looks like and what it can do, are spreading a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences alongside iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to be completely different from the previous model.
Four colours are mentioned: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is obviously a screen that covers the entire phone's front panel, the home button is lost and the fingerprint reader is built in the screen.
Apple's designer JonyIve requires a new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
There's been a talk about the ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to eyelid scanners, wire-free loading and even more high quality cameras, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
I'm sure it's a smart phone that's been expected for one year.
Pre-charge of the new model Galaxy Note 8 begins on August 23.
There's been a lot of rumors about how the new Galaxy Note 8 will look.
It is heard that even more business users are designed and S Pen will allow even greater functionalities.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a wide angle and the other a telescope with a narrower view.
Now nobody knows what two behind cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable to iPhone 8.
But we look forward to the 23th of August.
Although Nokia has sold this year three smart phones in the front of Nokia 6, there is still a lack of their flagship - Nokia 8, which will already be presented on 16 August.
We look forward to the screen from Nokia 5,3 to the edge of the edge and the high-speed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, the aluminium corpus and the significant level of water and dust stability IP68 are also mentioned.
Like Samsung, the new model of Nokia has two behind cameras that are produced by the optics by Zeiss.
If Sony's sure flagship has been the XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smartphones will be added, with even more innovative functions.
We expect a smart phone that is a little more modest than XZ Premium, but at least as good or better with a camera.
For Sony's new model, it's speculated that its screen is at least six tons.
What brings us to reality, we will be able to see soon, as Sony traditionally has published his autumn flagship on the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place this year until 1-6 September.
According to the transscripts leaked by phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico for payment for the border wall
The Washington Post published the transcripts of phone calls between President Donald Trump of the United States and the Mexican and Australian government leaders.
On January 27, Trump called the president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, to stop public preaching so that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of America smashed the wall with him for public condemnation, saying, "You mustn't say it to the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign's promise to build the southern border of the United States and swore that Mexico would pay for this project.
Transcripts were also published from his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals a tense debate.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on their way to Australia is "smarchery", "snoring" and "rumal," he claimed that the agreement that was made during the Obama government would give him the impression that he would be a "jubil" because he has proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States of America.
Trump finished the call, informing Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant speech of the day".
The Court of Justice did not take a hearing on the case where the city of Tartu rejected their offer for the supply of bus routes from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a decree which rejected the offer of OÜ MRP City Lines on the Tartu bus service, as the offer did not meet the requirements, explained by Anneli Avathin, the head of the Municipal Government of Tartu.
It is a public bus transport contract within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP The Linns of the City of Tartu sued the judgment of the District Court of Tartu.
This was not dealt with by the Court of Justice.
While in social media, many complain that the noise at the Weekend Festival is disturbing their sleep and the whole city is full of drunken partyers, there are also many who have no bad words about a beach-long festival.
I'm even positively surprised that the store was so polite!
I didn't see any shyness or rudeness.
I even saw kindness," says Blaine.
"It's nice to be come, to be happy and to enjoy Pärnu, which is winter as winter asleep," he adds joyfully.
It's not an uncomfortable Laine dream that's rising from the beach.
When he was living in the city, he still heard music playing at the beach, the music hasn't reached his home.
"But I hope I hear," he says gladly.
Agnes, also speaking with the evening leave, says that the grand festival is more good for Pärnu - it is a good thing for local traders.
In addition, he is pleased that so many outlanders have visited the summer capital.
It doesn't bother a woman of genius.
Even though I don't sunk at the beach anymore, I'm glad the beach's been alive.
And I'm glad that the people move, and it's already been three times," says the woman.
The first time it must have been a little worse.
"Maybe there were complaints," he thinks.
But the noise on the beach, he said, is common for summer headlines.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harri in the park.
The noise and the noise haven't hit his rhythm.
But what about it?!
We should all stick together.
Think of how this inter-national communication would be better.
A man of loud music doesn't crush.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live right there.
"Good people can save and there's no trouble," he says.
The guests who came to Pärnu said they're polite.
"They have been overreacting with the pipes, of course, but young people are young and Lord God - let them go, but be human and we can do it!" he says.
The coastal residents have traveled somewhere away by then, either to relatives or to familiars.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this noise," says Tina, who walked with the children of Pärnus.
Even his family and festival music is not disturbed, although in the past year it came beyond this year.
Last summer, the stage was on the other side, and then we heard more.
We live outside the city itself, that it actually touches quite well that far along the Pärnu River," he says.
Pearson cuts 3000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revitalise business
On Friday, the British educational company Pearson said that another 3,000 jobs would be cut and its interim dividends would be reduced by 72 percent, thereby launching another restructuring programme to solve the turbulence of the business.
In addition to the 4000 posts lost during the previous restructuring, the loss of jobs, according to the CEO John Fallson, will be highly likely at the end of 2018 and early 2019.
Pearson announced in May of the plan to cut the costs of the third cost reduction programme by another 300 million pound (394 million USD) in order to try to revitalise the business that has been gained through the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell a share in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann last month, said that their expectations for the year have not changed since the 1 % increase in sales revenue was reported in the first half of the year of GBP 2.05 billion.

Convoi attack in Kabul: a NATO soldier died in a suicide attack
According to officials, the self-defense bomber attacked military convoys in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several of the other.
The NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local announcements, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district of the city.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people died at the Herat Mosque attack.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul near the Iraqi embassy.
The NATO statement said that a Thursday night explosion took place when a joint battalion with the Afghan army was attacked by "man-made explosive material".
According to the application, they are all in stable condition and are treated at the US Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to Correspondents, the growing force of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) is a serious source of concern for the forces in Qarabagh, NATO Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, some 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed by a car bomb in Kabul.
According to the Taliban, they were attacked.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed by a major bombing attack in the city - a military attack that has resulted most of the deaths in the country since the forces under the leadership of the United States in 2001 were defensive of the Taliban.
This violence highlights the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while President Donald Trump of the United States is considering whether to increase the number of US troops to help the state's army and the police.
According to Correspondents, suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also brought public confidence crisis against the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA has withdrawn the decision to postpone the suspensive order after appeals
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has annulled the decision to delay the adoption of an Obama-time regulation, which obliges the States to limit the emissions that cause shocks, one day after the 15 States sued the Agency for its visit.
The EPA announced its decision to continue with the 'Ozone Conservation Operations of 2015' late Wednesday, saying that this demonstrates the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe that we must have a dialogue with our state partners and listen to them," said the EPA leader, Scott Pruitt, in a statement.
In June, Pruitt had announced that the EPA had intended to postpone ozone levels to measure suture pollution in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to comply with a more stringent air quality standard.
15 mainly democratic state states, together with the Columbia district, filed a complaint on Tuesday, saying that this decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has attempted to withdraw a number of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama, which, according to the Trump, is part of the broader growth plan.
But these attempts have caused counter-reactions among Democrats and Nature Protection Groups who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website says that the inhalation of ozone-containing air "can reduce the ability of the lungs to work and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases", such as as as asthma.
German pigs may have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a party because strong rain threatens the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, writes Bloomberg.
It may be this year that weeks of rain attacks before harvest can mean that fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for feeding animals.
"The quality of the wheat is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffeisen's analyst Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can go to animal feed, which is double compared to the usual, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have been exposed to any weather this year.
First, winter was too dry.
Then the cold spring came, which was replaced by a hot flush in June.
In July, Germany was hit by rain attacks, which has continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to Northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
In most areas, the harvest has not yet begun, reported by the local harvest buyer in Ceravis.
"It's a pretty difficult day," said Ceravis' senior trader, Frank Deckert, from Rendezvousburg.
Consistency in everything, or in Finnish internal designs,
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the Messianic homes because through large windows, Saimaa’s marvelous views reach many rooms (life).
At every step, the efforts of our northern neighbors to create hard and perfect (energy savings) homes at the same time.
Familiarity and observance deserves the use of Finnish wood as construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty.
Rising techniques and smart solutions can be found in the Messianic Houses both by the builder and (home) designer.

The night against today, a line was drawn down to the Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix gave everything on the headboard to remember as the last performer.
The people were really turning around during Garrix’s performance -- singing, choking, dancing in self - despair.
When Garrix finished, the joint mass was dispersed from Pärnu to the city.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing the possible conflict.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at the crash course to meet the closest ever-to-be boxing fight up to 66.7 kg, first met on Thursday.
They were in the ESPN office in Los Angeles separate rooms until Garcia, the invincible World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked to the other end of the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's feathers champion.
After Garcia's unanimous decision, the victory of the former four-fold world champion Adrien Broner in Showtime on Saturday, both warriors belong to the prerequisite of the scale table.
Garcia gave her right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko protects his belts with Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 pm at ESPN.
When a couple posed for the photographs, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas said that there would be a possible conflict between the fighters "a perfect measurement".
"I'm a former featherweight," recalled Garcia.
"I moved up for Broner [63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kg.
I want to move down the lightweight.
And he must move upwards [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans have wanted it.
Let's offer them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The Pox world needs this fight."
The climate raised the question of whether it should be payable to look at it. It is part of his strategy, according to which he wants Lomachenko to debut at the end of this year in a class of 61.2 kg to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 nokaut), who also has an interest in fighting Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's match winner after their title round on 23 September.
"A look at this fight could be worthwhile because fans have wanted this conflict," said Garcia, later said that he was open to fight on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are the main workers.
No other name can gain so much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said she thinks Lomachenko is a powerful fighter and she can go see her fight from Saturday.
But Lomachenko was modest in congratulations on Garcia, saying that he thought the master of the three divisions from Riverside saw out "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted to do it."
According to Garcia, the aim was to show the strength of the impact and then to fight.
Both confirmed that they felt that the tension between them would grow to prosper.
"This is a fight that awaits realisation.
No other confrontation creates so much attention and confusion.
I'm more than willing to work for it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is exactly this.
It's gonna be a good fight."
From what corners of the world are they moving to Estonia?
Mulu extended and issued recordly more than 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have travelled mainly to Estonia for work, study or family.
For example, when the soil was decided to issue a temporary residence permit for 6702 foreigners, the tubullu was the number 4928.
Officials cannot tell how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such analysis will be drawn up by the Ministry of Interior.
When, ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year, this figure will be close to 2000 in recent years.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased rapidly during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014, 1087 persons received a temporary residence permit, a year earlier 675.
According to the Statistical Office, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing most in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than they did.
"The Ukrainian community has been great all the time in Estonia, and because of complex circumstances in the country it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought in a country where the community and many people are already in front of the family," said Kristin Rammus, a press representative of the Ministry of Interior.
The number of Oekraines, which had a fixed residence permit, was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in the last ten years the most fixed residence permits have been issued.
If the Ukrainians come to work in this area, Russian citizens for family migration.
"In recognising this historical Russian community, they are more likely to have the greatest family relationships with the people living in Russia," said the Migrant of the Home Defence Academy, Helina Masing.
"If you look at where Estonian residents have moved to, Harjumaa will be right after East Viruland," he added and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Mulu received a fixed residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased.
"Shope is because, instead of prolonging the residence permit, a new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence in Estonia," explained the press representative of the Ministry of Interior, Rammus, who said that the interests of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit have remained stable for years.
A new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia can be applied to foreigners who lived here for at least three years from the previous year.
Its aim is to promote the stay of adapted people.
For example, a long-term resident’s residence permit requires five years.
The new residence permit has probably reduced the extension of the old residence permit.
For example, such a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
The Ukrainians can now change their jobs, and the Estonian state will no longer have the finger to see if the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit became popular at the moment - applicants are still the owners of the gray passport (1029), the Russians (487), the Indians (54) and the Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Grucin and the Chinese, received a residence permit for residence in Estonia.
In the first semester of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
Over ten years, a country which has become surprisingly a country in Nigeria, whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for a residence permit in Estonia.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, there were 200 soils.
They're coming from Nigeria to study universities here.
Estonian higher education schools are also popular, for example, among Gruzins, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen predominantly thanks to the study trip.
They are also subject to the rule that where the community has emerged, there will be more of the others," added Rammus.
Over the last ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If some 6000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit per year, this is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if more citizens of the European Union were to assume, the migration will remain about a percentage,” said Maasing, that the figures are actually small.
According to the Statistical Office, 14 822 people travelled to Estonia, but 13 792 from here.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
Most of them are Estonian citizens, but more are among the departers.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was down with 2000 people.
Estonians travel mainly between Finland and Estonia.
Mama Couture's princess fashion is charming with seals, towels and tramps.
However, for Maria Tammeloru, it is history - old paintings and costumes: "I may dream somewhere in a museum and admire old sleeves and garments for hours.
If you do something with a passion, you study it and learn about it every day.
It's a pleasure to discover!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may look like a living stranger, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how bright your life is!
I have a friend who has a whole sauna full of the hate cuture dresses I created.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go to the red carpet every day, he wants to wear those most beautiful dresses, and he's wearing it!
You can live your own life as special!
The designer doesn't recognize the gap between the shining events and the day of the grey.
This is what led to the plan to take the high fashion to the countryside in Estonia, between the forests and the fields, to the people that fashions often do not reach.
The mammu collection was presented, for example, in Võrus, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashionel, where the Royal Defiles with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, they often take in a pose, they choke with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - crying braavo, rising up, wanting to thank you hand-handedly.
A lot of the audience just came to anew, but now they're Mamba Couture fans.
If you cross human expectations, they will be enthusiastic!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer trip with my design.
Pärnu had a 50-metre red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it seemed like they're not gonna end!
Maria also does not recognize the impressive fact that creation must be presented to the super-sale supermodel, and she will be happy to bring the ordinary women on stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they have always come with pleasure.
It's such a fascinating experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my performance myself, I'm always behind the stage to give the last fat as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't let me look quietly out of the hall.
Maria is this kind of styler that doesn't just want to play the role of representation, but to be in the hands of everything.
I have my sewing machine at the studio, most of the collection I do myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, you discover.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
It's not limited to design, it's also stylists, logistics, organisation, organization, everything has to fit the day of a temperament woman.
I mean, these hours of work are still enormous for fanatics.
I can't tell you when my day of work ends, it's just a day full of joy to me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an endless chain of happiness: I'm doing something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful, and another one of the compliments.
There's been many times that I have magic in my dresses that make you feel like a princess.
The rich satires that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture until today.
Martin Wallet of the U18 boys: the Estonian subgroup tournament gun was now turned against us.
Too bad, the fairy tale's over.
The first thing I saw was that we couldn't get our desk.
And when this big difference comes in the table, there is nothing to do", commented Estonian U18 basketball boys 61:75 falling down to Britain, our only basketball player playing in NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo auxiliary trainer Martin Wallet.
The opponents took 28 balls from the launch table and they got so much more attacks.
We weren't ready for their aggressive protection or attack, it created.
Many British attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build up protection.
But in the defense, they were able to keep their hands all over the place, and we couldn't combine.
It hit the crew's legs.
The homework of the opponents was better done.
According to Mirisepa, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes to eliminate the attack of the opponents.
On the last quarter, we had zero errors, but the opponents already had several quick baskets.
Athleticity and acquaintance, which was our weapon on the subgroup tournament, now all turned against us.
Today we had no power against their aggression.
The wallmaker, with his guardian, remained in peace with Kalev, Matthias Tassi.
In general, the tournament can say good words about the whole team, so far, a single hit.
It's a pity that you've met before with such an aggressive opponent.
The cup has always been self-confirmed and played today to his way out, but it seemed he was tired - he has worn quite a big load.
But he did some pretty move I've seen in training before," he added the tutor.
Horrible numbers: in the women's basketball band, the EM tournament was thrown by less than 10 points in three quarters...
In the U18 age class, the EMI B-divisjon basketball tournament is not only in Tallinn for young men, and the girls started in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland, unfortunately, was in the field of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third roller coast there was a stand of 9:49, or in the last ten minutes, the opponents took their foot from the gas pedal, and that period remained at 16:16.
On both the first and the second quarter, Estonia threw 4, on the third 1 points...
At first in two minutes, the Estonian women caught two of the first four shots, and then 25 by the game, then one in three, and then 21 by...
Maybe in almost half an hour, 47 shots were captured.
In addition, two of the four free shots came.
There were a reasonable number of pineapples in that time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had a whiskey hit of 33% and Estonia had 13% (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, the day of the opening was to acknowledge the advantage of Portugal 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to add stock
Today NATO's 1st permanent mine control group arrived at a planned port visit in Tallinn to complement the ship's stocks and prepare for the preceding exercises.
During the visit, ships shall prepare for their return to the sea and provide crew members with the opportunity for a couple of days of vacation.
After the visit, NATO ships remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and be prepared for future search operations for historical explosives.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO Unit and their cooperative training in the local waters is well reflected in our integration with the allies," said Captain Major Arto Reinland, commander of the Operation and Planning Division in charge of the Navy fleet.
From 29 June, NATO heads the 1st permanent group of mine fighters, Lieutenant Latvian Navy, Captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the task of the group commander at the ceremony held in Riga from the Estonian Navy officer Lieutenant Johan-Elias Selyaland.
The flagship of the group is designated as the Latvian Navy support vessel in LVNS Virsait, which is also operated by the group leader.
In this semester, the Estonian Navy Mine Hunt Sakala is also part of the international unit.
One of the four ship groups under NATO marine command is the NATO 1st permanent mine control group, one of the primary fast-reactors, which the Alliance may be sent to different parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita’s monastery will be once again a place where the Birgitta Festival, called by Maestro Eri Klas, 13 years ago, is being decommitted.
According to Risto Joosti (36) the artistic leader of Tallinn Philharmonic, the Birgitta Festival, will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The audiences will reach the opera classics include "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballet receptions of the fascinating "Bolerost" to the fun "Karlsson" and there is also no own production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorium, which was created by the same international creative team who in 2015 brought to Pirita Haydn's second masterpiece.
Birgitta Festival has a lot more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It's bigger than any music theatre in its usual form.
It's a festival that's fascinating and never let it go again.
Because the experience that the listener receives in this superior and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touches human minds in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the first year of Birgitta Festival.
Didn't it look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with the Special Klas, it's been a lot of help.
He moved me through my entire student career and supported me at the beginning of my career.
Maybe that's why it makes it easier for me to continue his work.
Special Class has injected the Birgitta Festival team so much good, and of course it's all transferred to me.
It was great to join a team who knows exactly how things work.
Just the great heart of Eri Klas gave me the strength to move on with the Birgitta Festival in Philharmonic, Tallinn.
And here I am now, and I can handle it!
What could make the audience fancy at the festival this year, which you are offering specially?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and as a surprise, there is also the first ballet written on Astrid Lindgren's story.
It's called "Karlsson Flying."
And one of the criminal nuances is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed the wish to write this work.
He must have had Karlsson's character in his soul since he was a kid.
Risto, how can you do all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have a lot of it.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions aren't as much dependent on other people as I am, perhaps, on every new day.
And holding such a conscious tone, keeping positive and actually smiling to yourself in a mirror in the morning, significantly increased my lucky percentage.
Especially now this week, when the most important samples are, I have been very keenly practicing it and it works.
Laughing at himself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a vocabulary.
I think people still don't know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers to them, but I guess everyone's gonna find it slowly.
Now, it's an important moment.
Do you have a ritual before you step into a dirigent's station?
There is, the clothes must be changed for more comfortable.
It's this little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have the chance to rest or have a little sleep.
In fact, I even like to have active contacts with people, even before I step into the dirigent.
But all of you, come to Birgitta Festival, here's something to discover not a very big opera and ballet friend!
Look at the mood video with Risto Joost!
New results of the assessment of the age of Swedish asyl applicants were published
The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of the subjects were considered older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Judicial Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the tests in the beginning of this year.
The tests were established for a more accurate assessment of the age of asyl application after criticising the Swedish Migrationsverket because they had failed to correctly determine the age of several minor refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to test, and the Judicial Institute has issued a total of 2481 tests between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) was estimated to be 18 years old or older, and in 25 more cases, the Judicial Institute assessed that the test could be "aged 18 or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person is "probably younger than 18".
Tests shall only be used if the age of a person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson, the results of the Judicial Institute are consistent with those of the previous months.
"We don't see a big difference compared to previous months' statistics, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to The Local.
The fact that a large number of cases were considered older than 18, does not necessarily mean that asyl seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 test results in May and said that in 442 cases, there are indications that the person to be investigated is 18 years old or older.
But when Svenska Dagblade studied the results of these 581 tests, it was found that in 243 cases a person had directly claimed that he would be 18.
The method of medical evaluation of age, which makes X-rays of the wisdom teeth and the MRT of the knee joints, and then let dentists and radiologics analyse them, has been criticised in some circuits.
One of the sceptics is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include the evaluation of human biological maturity to determine whether they passed the puberty early or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
The definition of a biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we should not make a face that we can," he said to the newspaper Metro.
But Johan Göransson, from the Judicial Medicine Institute, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of child inaccurate adult separation is low.
The highest, perhaps, is about 10% of the risk if a person is a little less than 18."

The 20-year-old hammer shooter, Anna Maria Orel, made a beautiful job at the MM in London, getting a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was the youngest female wrestler, and a happy woman assured that she would hope to fight for the medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
With the first test (64.80) I immediately did my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much, and in the third (67.37) I could keep my head clear," said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm really glad I found this.
Anna Maria Orel's MM debut ended with a good 18th place.
Orel wasn't interrupted by the rainbow, because he's training the winter through the U.S. stadium.
"I'm carved," he said with a little snack.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house among the people, did Orel feel people around him or could he turn himself off?
I get it, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it's giving us more - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel assured me that he's going to stay with the MM debut, and there's a lot of good competitions waiting for him: "I came here with the 32th, or last result of this season, I ended up on 18th.
That's a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and MMil, that's the only thing that matters.
I'm taking a good experience, and someday I want to fight for the medals.
The Governor of West Virginia reported a party exchange
Governor Jim Justice of the Western Virginia Democratic Republic announced at a meeting on Thursday night with President Trump that he would change parties.
"I like it or not, but the Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Thank you, I tell you, after a lot of prayers and thoughts... today I tell you, to the western Virginiaans, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
The gathering began with joy.
"That'll make me a Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a trainer, I'd tell you, it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a great announcement at the Western Virginia Summit.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was selected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owned coal mines in five state states, and he asked his father for the coal industry.
Her value is about $1,59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) published a report on Thursday night that "counselling of the Governor Justice Party is another strike on a democratic party, which would rather prevent the country from transforming again rather than working for it".
"From all 15 governors and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is just the most recent resignation to a party that has been led to the end and cannot find a positive and connective message," said RNC presidentialist Ronna McDaniel, in a statement to CBS News.
It's not a surprise that there's a lot of people in there, too.
Urmet, who was at the Weekend Medical Tent last night, told the Evening Leaf that they had to share quite a lot of patches.
Birds and rapes are the main, out of twists and light falls.
Of course, the head, back and leg pain.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong footwear, and so problems come.
Medicis have also had to help a couple of more injured visitors - some panic attacks and one foot break.
We have also made stitches when a person has broken his hand or finger.
Smaller seams, we'll do it here, we'll send the bigger ones to the hospital.

Coe praised the Russians' honesty for the doping candal.
Sebastian Coe, the international leader of the Mild Forces, commended "Russian Thursday's fair apology" for the doping candal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country back to sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the leader of the Russian light force, said at the IAAF Congress on the night of the world championships in light force, that the competition ban imposed on his country is correct and has a solid objective to combat doping.
He apologized to the "all the light gangsters from whom the gold and silver medals have been snatched" in the competitions.
In spite of his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the competition ban imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency report (WADA) found evidence of state-funded doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," said President Coe of the IAAF to journalists.
"Welcome Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian subunion also acknowledged that they have had quite difficult times and they will do everything possible to restructure the sub-Union."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted its own restoration criteria.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress, but the Congress supports the group's proposal that it is not the right time for Russia to be withdrawn," said Coe.
"We must do everything possible in the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been based on the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen of the Russian Light Forces who meet the strict criteria of IAAF are competing for world championships in London on Friday as neutral athletes.
The head of the IAAF Group, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet a number of rehabilitation criteria.
After a report to the IAAF Council, he said to the journalists in London that the doping control is still insufficient and that the coaches who had been banned are still operating freely.
The revolution of electric cars significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Less than the fact that the revolution of electric cars significantly changes everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining gigs like Glencore can say that they win from one place and lose the other, smaller mining companies will not help.
At present, Glencore serves coal and oil, but in the age of electric cars the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will grow.
This year, the UK, France and Norway's governments' decisions on the distribution of electric cars have increased their contribution to banning the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
As a result, Volvo has already known that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring on the market a cheaper model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that electric cars are already sold over two decades more than cars using fuels produced from oil.
"For some metals, it changes everything," said the capital Economics raw material analyst to Simona Gambranini Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as caves and lithium, whose demand has grown for years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than the normal car, Glencore reported.
More copper is needed at loading stations, so Exane BNP Paribas estimates that by 2025 it will increase the demand for copper by about 5%.
The increase in battery demand for electric cars means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graft and manganese.
Glencore receives the growing trend of electric cars from the increase in copper prices and from the fact that it is the world's largest cobalt producer, forecasted by the Jefferies Group.
According to this brokerage company, Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals are the winners of the electric car race.
The market responds to a changing trend already.
This year, 70 percent have grown from the London Metal Stock Exchange.
The bubble price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also increased by 14 percent this year, mainly due to growth.
The share of Glencore increased by 20 percent in London after the rival Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
Losers have lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine, who have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of the lead is the batteries supplying power to start-ups for petrol and diesel engines.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk for the demand for lead unless it is found to be another purpose that could overcome the decline in demand," said the Bank of America Merrill Lynch's metal marketanalyst Michael Widmer.
The price movement of lead has not yet seen the impact of the rotating trend.
Lead has increased by 17 percent this year, which is the best metal in London from an increase in prices among the main industrial metals.
Investors will see problems for metal only a long way in the future.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for lead, because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager of the Metal broker company Triland Metalls.
If the demand for lead falls, it will happen slowly.
Maybe that's what happens in about ten years.
Until then, more stringent emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which depends on advanced lead-based batteries at the start of frequent engines, will be assessed by the international research organisation for lead and zinc.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel as a lighter car can drive further by less electricity.
This explains the additional demand for aluminum of 1.6 million tonnes from 2013 to 2016.
This represents 2.7 per cent of the total world production of aluminium.
Probably this trend is getting worse, said Widmer.
Aluminium has increased by 13 per cent this year because the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market deficiencies.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding cooperates with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce beautiful car rings.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to resist aluminum.
"Increasing steel should be the answer to this development," said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
Europe has some success.
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to the platinum.
Around half of that precious metal was used to catalysts for vehicles with diesel engines, the metal raffiner Johnson Matthey reported.
"A lot of high demand raw materials such as oil and platinum may not have much demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, analyst of Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will become within 15 years.
Platinists believe that the demand for diesel hybrid cars continues.
Marc Grynberg, head of Uncore, said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold from full electric cars.
The high hope of the platinum manufacturers in the 10-year term is to the cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depend on the platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
Until then, however, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars," said Exane BNP from Paribas by Brunet.
In July, German car manufacturers received a major relapse because the Stuttgart Court prohibited the use of the diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche's hometown.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the uncontrollable spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona French club Paris-Saint Germany.
Any consequences of UEFA, a management body that is in charge of Europe's game, which is able to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Masters League tournament, are waiting for Paris Saint-Germain.
The financial rules for the fair game established by UEFA in 2011 (FFP) mean that the PSG must at some point demonstrate that Neymar’s transition was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million (€262 million) only for buying a Brazilian from his contract, and Neymari's wage is starting to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of moving Neymari to the French club.
The PSG is undoubtedly in a position to recruit Neymar and add such money to its star-rich line, given that the team is funded by the cataract family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money in recruiting players, but they need to balance it with legal sources of income that enable them to come out in the football industry.
The FFP was set up by Michel Platin after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs who fall to large debts in search of success would actually be involved in cheating and risk depriving if banks or owners had to give up their support.
Since 2011, FFP focuses on monitoring their losses instead of the debts of the clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 in Chelsea - buy a club with potential and then make high costs to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
For the current three-year evaluation period, which runs until 2018, clubs may bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the disgrace of Platin being displaced from the presidential office in 2015, Aleksander Cefterin, his descendant of UEFA, is still committed to preventing excessive consumption.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules," said the Associated Press Andrea Traverso, who is a FFP supervisor in UEFA.
Although the PSG paid for Neymari’s acquisition clause as a whole payment, it is possible for them to distribute this amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract and therefore it is possible to show the transitional fee for the next five years as a sum of EUR 44,4 million per year.
In the case of the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG and Abu Dhabi City received the most severe sentences.
A fine of EUR 60 million (when currently USD 82 million) was imposed on PSG, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the Master League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs who may try to compile regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through companies linked to the club owners.
The Qatar company may sponsor PSGs, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to be above the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the aid for Qatar Tourism Authority PSG was attributable.
It has been said that some of Neymari's PSG service can become the World Championship Board of 2022 through payments from Katar.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a consignee of world championships and claim that UEFA regulators would be able to easily reveal such manoeuvres.
The penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that the UEFA is even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules.
The people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that the UEFA has not discussed the transition with the PSG for Neymar.
They talked to The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity is ensured because they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The recent reports show that the PSG earned more than EUR 10 million in the 2015-2016 season at around EUR 542,4 million in turnover.
The data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
The PSG hopes that Neymar’s arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and the sale of shirts.
The club expects an increase of at least 30% in turnover in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
In Spain too, as clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, he tried to prevent Neymar's transition, claiming that the PSG would violate FFP.
"This is a clear "monetary doping" case with the club and the country," said President La Liga Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that the PSG mainly belongs to Katar.
Arsenali Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnet, shares the attitude of La Liga to finance the club.
"This is the result of property rights and has completely changed the entire football landscape in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the fair game, as the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a great player's country."

Today 50 years ago: the storm of the hurricane in Estonia, ripping the roofs and windows from the houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which burst on August 6 and 7 caused serious damage, especially to the West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
In northwest Estonia, during these days, the wind was more than 30 m/s.
My old man ran from the tree to the other in the garden and touched them with his hands to support them.
Everything was dark and clumsy, like the end of the world.
In 2002, the old lady Linda Kurova Haapsalus magazine, the Estonian Nature interview, was already flying from the houses.
Linda's husband saw her own planted garden collapsed.
But what are you still supporting the trees with your hands where you get against this storm?
The sea came under the window, sprayed in the water from the windows," said Mrs Linda in the street of Haapsalus Kalda.
The fact that the roads were filled with trees and that the roof of the railway station had flew 20 to 30 meters away, Linda saw only the next morning, like most of the Hapshalians.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were down, some totally down, some half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through the beautiful old trees as a wreck and a crack like war.
West Virumaa could not suffer particularly severely in August 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the losses were also large there, wrote the Virumaa Journal in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padis Park were wiped out of the ground, but also the parks in our region were severely affected.
The wind rate in Tallinn was measured at a speed of up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
In Tallinn on the Seafield, on the night of August 6, a little girl called, "Mama, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can't get down!" wrote the Virumaa Journal.
The building of Põll’s landscape in Viljandi was so destroyed during the storm that it was decided to be destroyed later.
The August storm was not tolerated by the constructions of Tyr's ski jump mountain, which was no longer recovered.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star wrote that the cleaning of towns and settlements from the fallen trees and their branches would slowly progress, and the inhabitants could contribute to the harvesting work.
In the storm, crop fields were also severely affected, and the newspaper stated that "party organizations must be inspiring and guiding both in the organisational work and in the harvesting process".
Orkans can be spoken if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of the flushing wind in Estonia continues from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnu was measured at a wind rate of 48 m/s.
On the island of octopus, the instrument was broken, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of clean bathing beaches: nights cleaning and bad beach weather
The colder summer weather also means less harvesting in the beaches of Tallinn.
"If there is weather, there are people on the beach, and if they don't, there are no people," says the beach cleaner.
In the northern town of Stroom, echos are screaming.
They are offered melody competition by a sparkling tractor on the low turns that folds the stripes on the patch.
In fact, the last seven centimeters deep through the sand, picking out sea crusts and a twist left by people: bottle caps, cigarettes, and so on.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If the weather is beautiful, people are on the beach, and if they are not, there are no people,” says the association Haaberst Administration Manager Aleksandr Usov.
It's 6:30 p.m. on the beach, and it's a bitter cleaning job, because at 8:00 p.m., the place must be okay for people.
Usov's already on the job post from four o'clock.
Beyond Stream, he still keeps an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Paljasarea on the Pikar shore.
Waste levels have declined.
Years ago, there was a lot more.
People are already able to appreciate what they do for them," says Usov, who has cleaned the beach for 15 years.
Before something new was set up, it was already broken next day.
Now they're keeping what's on the beach.
Clean beach price
One of the major works on the beaches of Estonia is the cleaning of sea garbage, or adrum, spilled on the shores.
For example, at Pirita’s beach, 400 000 tonnes must be transported after the shore season.
"This is an incredible amount," says Usov.
The second major category is dust, or everything people leave behind.
There are eight large garbage containers on the stairway of Stream, which need to be dried times a week.
That's how much garbage comes up.
However, colder summer weather has meant that garbage is a fifth less than otherwise.
The third species consists of abandoned things.
Mostly, they're children's puppets.
As this time of harvest, Usov has swept a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They'll be waiting for owners on the road to the beach.
Usov already knows he'll find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to re-drow them into the sand.
The garbage is dismantled
The representative of the administrative services of Haberst, Erika Scholler, admits that the screening work of the tractor is disrupted by the locals.
The noise, which lasts from night to morning, interferes with the sleep of the people in the neighborhood.
But it's impossible on the day.
One month, the beach has to be screened twice.
"If we don't do this, we'll be fine in the district," says Schuller.
However, the goal is, like Pirita, Pikkar and Pärnu, to get the Strroom Beach under the international blue bulb quality mark.
"In comparison to Europe there is much more work in Estonia to maintain the beaches," says Schuller.
We have more apples and stones, and it's harder to sniff the sand.
However, there is less garbage on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
As Martin, who lives near the beach of Stroom, is talking about garbage on the beach, is incredibly inclined by the interview of journalists and cleaning workers, bringing up the current bottlenecks of the beach.
There's a dirty picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottlenuts who have dragged garbage bags to the bottom," says Martin.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behavioural habits, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about garbage and, for example, put the covers on them to prevent at least birds from renewing there.
However, in general, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Stromer coast.
It's obvious that the city will take care of it.
It has become more pleasant in children’s fields, enlightened and freshly asphalted roads.
At one time, the rollers were only able to drive on one road,” says Martin.
The discoveries of the treasure hunter in Steros: coins, only coins
The 40 - year - old Dimitri has come to use this morning's diagnostic period, which as a treasured chef combines a beach mark with a metal detector.
He does not believe he will find anything precious today or in the future.
The sea gods aren't generous enough to do that.
"I've been working on this for a year, and I haven't found anything worth it," says Dmitri.
As a horsehunter, there are some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous pounds in Dmitri's treasure bag, which will throw them in the trash later.
It's usually coins.
"The gold, the rings and all that you usually don't exist," says the treasure hat.
Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected from the Bank of England that interest rates will remain at the same level as inefficient growth and inflation reductions have weakened speculations in relation to the increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain southwest, as households' sealed incomes have set up interest rates.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers voted in favour of maintaining the levels of 6:2 at 0.25%, and less members demand a rise this month, as slow economic growth has weakened their support for rising.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 by 1.7% and on its 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household income will remain, as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in autumn.
However, the Bank also indicated that the increase in the rates will be necessary to control the inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years and that a higher expected increase in the lending costs could be required on the financial markets.
Members also voted a year ago in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package which was launched as a result of Brexit.
In February, the Bank will complete a fixed-term financing scheme providing cheap financing for banks, although it said that now it is expected to be 15 billion pounds higher in the framework of this scheme, which is about 115 billion pounds.
In the minutes of the decision taken on the matter, the Bank says: "In the MPC central projection, the gross domestic product (GDP) will remain in force in the near future, as the difficult situation in the actual incomes of households will continue to have an impact on consumption."
As regards the definitions, it was reiterated that it was necessary to mitigate inflation to "reduce some effort in finance policy" and to a "somewhat larger" extent, if market expectations were expected.
The stock exchange is now predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that all kinds of jumps are stepped up and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the forecasts of May by 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast of 1.8% growth in 2018 remained stable.
After this news, the price of pounds fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which have undermined the growing hopes of the rise in GDP in the second quarter of the previous three months from 0.2% to 0.3%.
The Bank says that growth is likely to persist at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it begins to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to welcome the households suffering from rising inflation and a pathetic rise in wages, saying that the situation would get a little worse before recovery.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent the impact on income over the next few years, but a significant wage recovery is expected at the end of the three-year forecast.
As a result of weak pounds, the growing demand for British production also stimulates the economy, which partly compensates for lower consumer costs.
The decision will take place one year after 0,25% of the figures were taken last August after the shocking EU referendum, which led to a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the Bank, it is likely that it will take four years to fully absorb prices and the economy.
Before the bank’s last decision, there was a growing demand for higher rates, since inflation had increased the pressure on households in distress; in July, three policy makers demanded an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell by 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected and the coming months would be expected to rise again.
The Bank said that the excessive increase compared to the 2 % target was due to a completely weak female.
Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco's mortgage broker, said: "In view of the recent decline in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming more competitive because the lenders want to work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions will be completed, since refinancing, often without a fee and a low rate, has become increasingly popular."
The NHS is writing out the HIV drug that caused the conflict to 10,000 people
Since September, patients have been able to access "transformative" HIV preventive treatment after a battle in the Supreme Court on whether NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England reported that public health is now estimated to make 10 000 people available pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablets, which are being administered prior to intermediation and have shown a decrease in the risk of infection by approximately 86% in people at high risk.
NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the Court of Appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year, according to which NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite its own claims that the medicinal product should be financed by local authorities.
Mr Simon Stevens, the Executive Director of NHS England, welcomed this published action on Thursday as a "new extensive intervention", while the National Aids Fund (NAT) described it as a "inverse moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first ones who are about to register people. In October there are additional clinics before the programme is introduced everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is a curb of HIV medicines taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials indicate that PREP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are enough medicines in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicinal products may be taken daily or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Candidates suitable for treatment include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexuals and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not treated.
Clinics identify suitable people who agree to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transsexuals and those whose HIV-induced partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate in the local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The programme will pay 10 million pounds and NHS England signed a contract to obtain the medicinal products this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicinal product is intended and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new extensive intervention should complement and strengthen the broader and increasingly successful fight against HIV distribution.
This is another mylpost in the fight against one of the greatest health problems for mankind over three decades."
Deborah Gold, the NAT executive leader, said, "This is a critical moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is properly targeted to those who need it and belong to the risk group, it offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people with a high HIV risk have access to a powerful new tool, which is individually manageable and is not dependent on negotiating with a partner, thereby improving many lives, through this clinical trial funded by NHS.
We welcome this announcement warmly."
Ian Green, the CEO of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: "It is now essential to ensure that a clinical trial is pushed over the country quickly and that no one in the HIV risk group is missed.
Now that PrEP's clinical trial drug has been acquired, we're on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of getting HIV.
Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: "The beginning of the PREP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delays and the leaning of the government.
The evidence shows how much changes this medicine can lead to the prevention of HIV and its life-changing infection.
This clinical test leads us a step closer to a full understanding of PrEP's advantages.
It is now important that a clinical trial is introduced to the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
Electricity prices increased by 12% in Estonia, while Latvia and Lithuania fell.
In July, the exchange price gap between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.94 compared to EUR 7.71 in June this year, Elering announced.
The main cause of price differential is the failures of the Lithuanian-Sweden Community.
In Estonia, the average exchange price for electricity was EUR 34.33 per megawatt hour last month and the price increased by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent from megawatt hour to EUR 36.27.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the system price of the electricity exchange Nord Pool was EUR 26.37 per megawatt hour.
Prices increased by 12 and 7 per cent respectively.
Electricity between Estonia and Finland moved 75 per cent of the previous month to Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of hours between the two countries did not take place on the next day.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved from Estonia to Latvia for 99 per cent, and 73 per cent of the hours had full transmission capacity.
According to transactions on the Nasdaq OMX market on the last day of July, the electricity exchange price may be approximately EUR 34 and EUR 37 per megawatt hour in September in August.
The cost of carbon dioxide affecting the electricity production price increased last month and transactions took place at EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Elevation - half floor and smart designs have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate newer of real estate, replaced his large Knightsbridge home in 2014 for Earls Court's apartment.
It's on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed up her bags and sold the apartment is a respect for the new design.
"Before I lived on a much bigger surface with my former partner in Knightsbridge," said Joanne.
"I've been looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
They showed me this Earls Court apartment and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-square apartment has undergone complete innovation.
At first, it was a bedroom and a complexed apartment - to reach the bedroom, it had to be walked through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to use high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi Notting Hill from the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to use 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces on each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half floor where you could stand up.
Erfan was supposed to approach it creatively.
"The metall construction is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to reorganize the rooms, so they'd be on each other without having to bow.
It wasn't just the construction of a platform, but we used a steel structure so that the height of both the upper and the lower space would be correct."
This regulation enabled Erfan to create two full-high rooms in the room with a lot of dramatic elements.
From the middle floor, the old-fashioned copper will be opened from the retrovius window to the glamorous living room below the view.
The spiegeled golden furniture, silver details and retro-sparkling Serge Mouille's light highlights the style of the space.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, spaciousness and enlargement.
In both ends of the short corridor, mirrors have been added to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror makes the window open to another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage room for all Joanne's appetizers and glassware.
The living room is added to the charm of closing the kitchen if it is not used, creating an imagination of a more glamorous space.
The kitchens that are convenienced aren't new.
In the kitchen, however, the unique fact is that it is a garage type of lifting door.
"It took a bit of design trouble," explains Erfan from the MDF door with steel support.
"It has a counterweight, so it slips very easily if it pushes it."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage room, Joanne now has 16 additional square meters, an additional bedroom and a better flat plan.
"In the end, the floor surface is what you sell - or what gives value to real estate," says Erfan.
"The real estate broker enters an obsolete form of room and makes calculations based on the surface of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase the floor surface by using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"Materials are the ones you touch, which helps to create emotional connections with your home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical supply in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the heart ring."
It shows that a good design and an increased area helps to make a rather ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even cause a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The main character Dane Jensen is a high-facing bounty hunter in Chicago who competes with a colleague for promotion.
No matter how much money you earned, any ethics are forgotten.
His wife and three children only see him early in the morning and late night.
In the first half of the film, I was thinking that it's the commercial version of the "Card House" world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech manager are similar.
The further the film, the less the element of the frame is left, and the more moralizing intention of the filmmakers is becoming more and more.
A life-changing experience will be the development of cancer for the main character of the son.
Now you have to choose between work and family life.
A son dreaming of the Architects will put his father on walks to large buildings in Chicago to think about real important things, such as faith, goodness, love, not even a twin tower disaster.
After the third scene where the son opens his father’s eyes, it turns out that the filmmakers have come up with the goal of crying the audience, because even the bleacher of the heart can't hold back tears when he sees the suffering of a lovely boy with cancer.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation looks hopeless, the father will fully understand his work of morality and do good to the old man looking for work.
Now, I'm gonna bet on myself -- if the movie has happy self, then I'll premize my perception after the film's coffee, but if I'm wrong, you can thank a scenist for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a suspect that I'm gonna miss coffee... when my husband calls Dane from the hospital, and he's slowing down the hallway to the hall.
In fact, the son is miraculously healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it is positive, because now there is time to deal with the family.
I can feel well, too. I can predict the end of the American drama.
To honor the truth, the film is well designed, all the elements that are necessary for it are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, actresses are good and morally beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure that's gonna make a good movie.
The new Chief of Staff of Trump intends to limit the media consumption of the President.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can handle this, too.
In that case, he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new Head of Staff of the White House intends to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news, in the hope that this will keep the boss in a more smooth water.
Here's a broken reporter from Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met high officials on his first working day, he brought out the key problem of President Donald Trump in the White House, which he planned to solve the fact that the president had found bad information in his hands.
Kelly told the officials that the information should pass through her, whether on paper or at meetings, because the President would make better decisions if good information were to be shared."
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it, and they have failed to control Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television is beyond decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV watch habits haven't disappeared.
"When the candidate Trump was upset about the unfair media delusion, it was worth showing him that he was also honestly reflected in the influenced publications," said Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor in February to Politico.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at that time that "Six former campaign staff said Trump was the key to twitter exercises by ensuring that his personal media consumption also contains a stable vocabulary."
All right.
But the idea that the habits of using Trump Twitter have ever been "in control," is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know that Trump's sprays would have been even more flammable without their interventions.
We'll probably never know about the slippers that Trump didn't post.
When his assistants were able to save him a couple of times from trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from creating disputes consistently.
Part of the problem is that people in the White House of Competitive Clichés are trying to promote their own interests exclusively by transmitting material to Trump, which supports their world visions, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, reflecting the whole story of the story, wrote in May the advisors' tendency to feed the president strategicly questionable information.
One of the examples described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"The shortcomings and the former Trump subordinates say that Trump may respond to negative presses, especially injurious information sheets, blastfully, by obsessing their source of source.
This is what happened at the end of February when someone was happy to give the president a copy of the article on the website GotNews.com, which belonged to Charles C. Johnson, printed to the president, who accused Deputy Staff Commander Katie Walsh of being the source of the White House's "multimum information sheets".
It doesn't matter that Johnson's been permanently blocked from Twitter because of smashed, or that he didn't offer any concrete evidence, or that he's also made false accusations in the past and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and began asking the subordinates about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the former staff chief Reince Priebus and head of the White House office Rob Porter "have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents reaching Trump".
How did it work?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Maybe he's a more effective leader from Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive, and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians coming from abroad to the capital don't get permission to show up bitterly.
In the city centre of Tallinn, a lot of foreigners are singing music.
The people with whom the Evening Magazine was talking admitted to play in the old town without the permit of the municipality.
The first thing we found was three street musicians near the gates of Viru who had taken as many dogs as they had.
It was clear that musicians with racing sticks and cracked clothes were backpackers who could use a shower.
Despite his appearance, the only woman in the company played a story with a fun rhythm at the acordion, while a man along with him in three balls in the jungle and invited the passers closer.
The third man had been sitting next to them on one of the backpacks and smoked a screwed cloth in his heart.
These three dogs weren't allowed to be disturbed by the transient people.
Bob, playing the acordion with Noe and the balls, told me they were musing in the streets for fun and money.
The aim of the Society was to collect ticket money on a ship traveling to Finland the evening of the same day.
Asking if they asked the city for permission to kiss in the old town, shattered Noem and Bob's head.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple and mostly given permits for a month or something.
There's no point in paying for it," explained Bob.
When we got back to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw two women beside musicians and drive them away.
The Society moved with the backpacks and dogs to the Viru Centre cruise for happiness.
Three Polish young men, one of whom played violin, the other a clarnett, and the third had actually carried an electronic piano along the street.
"We are here to offer people entertainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained the trio from the piano Mivosh.
Mivosh says they're aware of the need for a city government permit to perform.
"Normally, we don't have it," he said.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we'll go somewhere else, but we have to try," he added.
In July, Eesti Pank bought bonds for EUR 149 million under the euro area central banks’ public reserve purchase programme, the central bank’s bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank will not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The President of the Estonian Bank, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained, in response to the reconciliation of the members of the Riigikogu, that the Eurosystem central banks' reserve purchase plan covers three different purchasing programmes: financial sector covered bonds (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public bonds (PSPPs).
The central bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
The effects of the purchases will decrease the return on assets with lower risk and will motivate investors to take higher risks.
In general, each central bank purchases its national government bonds within the framework of a public bond purchase programme, and other national bonds are not purchased.
As the Estonian State has not issued the bonds, the Eesti Pank will make substitute purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
Substitutions are also made by central banks in countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank usually purchases European institutions' bonds, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank will purchase bonds as of March 2015 under the Asset Purchase Programme.
In the meantime Elering bonds were also acquired, but from June 2016 Eesti Pank no longer purchases Elering bonds.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, both Elering and Eesti Energia bonds are purchased by the Finnish Central Bank as of June.
Travellers ignore the grave and return to the "millionaire divisions"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have come back to a fierce conflict with determined travellers who have ignored the cravings of the council to win back the field that is away from their wool.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in the fields of a wealthy "millionaire district" near Solihulli Street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children, and trucks after they were kicked out of there in May, without letting themselves get mixed with the crave that was digged by a council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak place at the protection limit by squeezing their vehicles through an unrested part that was left as a pathway.
The rageous residents have crawled into the Solihull Council, saying that the council is "no use to deal with the problem".
One anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night after their expulsion from Bentley Heath, where they smashed the passers with stones.
The Council must be ashamed of them taking action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back.
They came up again last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by getting long barriers to protecting its parks.
I live on the road to the Streetsbrook, and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying the commission tax if the council can't even stop this kind of thing."
One local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: "This is ridiculous. We only saw the last of these travellers left, and there is a new attack.
This time, the number has increased, and the grassland has even been seen to remember a horse."
A representative of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that in the land near the Streetsbrook road there is an unacceptable camp site, and we are working with the Solihull police, and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them to move as soon as possible.
It is very helpful to gather evidence when as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling number 101.
This will help us create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them."
The Weekend Festival is also visited by the Minister of Culture, Indrek Saar, who is pleased to have been able to bring real world top names to Estonia.
The question why Weekend is so important for Estonian festivals is answered by the island that it should be asked to all those who enjoy the three-day talk of the festival in full.
Yet, he realizes that the real workers in Pärnu have arrived.
"In view of the level of artists that can be brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre will be brought home - that is often not happening in our region," says the Minister of Culture.
What festivals, however, are the artists who speak the most about the island?
I think I'm a relatively old man, and for old people like me, I'm sure one of the most experienced artist Armin van Buchen, who stepped up last night.
According to his recording, we've all been swinging ourselves at some point," he says.
But he'll bring out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian makers are also: starting with NOÉP and they can be counted as a whole.
In reality, the concentration of known names is very high," he says.

Audi renews up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of the criticism that hit the car manufacturers
The day prior to Audi’s announcement, BMW said that it offers software completeness for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the president of the BMW, the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the home town of BMW, Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce the emissions of diesel engines.
None of the companies described these operations as a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and in the United States to help comply with the CO2 emission regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide produced by diesel engines is considered to be a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
In addition, the cost of equipment installed to neutralise the emissions of diesel vehicles for automotive companies is increasing, making it difficult to keep car prices competitive.
While German car manufacturers are subject to a thorough investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of despairing powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's errors, who silenced the use of so-called deceptive devices, allowing for the adjustment of the emissions signals to comply with the regulations at the time of the vehicle testing, but withdrawed in normal driving conditions.
A number of Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are on both sides of the Atlantic.
Former head of the thermodynamic sub-committee in Audi, Germany, was arrested last month.
Former President of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from issue and may go to court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation on Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused Audi of installing the system to circumvent the requirements of European emissions levels by extending the investigation that had focused on the United States of America.
The involvement of the Audi in the investigation could be a big blow for Volkswagen by the luxurious car manufacturer to generate a disproportionate proportion of Volkswagen's profits.
European Union flags are purchased for EUR 20 000 for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union to mark the Presidency for Estonian schools by 1 September.
A total of 105x158 centimeters will receive 570 educational institutions on the flag of the European Union.
The flags are intended to be exhibited indoors and must be carried out in high-quality printing indoors with tunnel fixing, the ERR newsportal.
The flagvarda label contains the text: "The gift for Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 tickets is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education, i.e. one flag costs EUR 35.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing danger in Mexico
The workers of the weekly newspaper Riodoce are usually gathering on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, which is embraced by organised crime, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They're told it's important to change their routines.
Two older writers are discussing which seems safer: bringing the children to the office that was targeted by a grenade attack in 2009 or leaving them home.
Security experts have written three words on the table at the top of the room: "Free enemies", "neutral," "United".
They're asking reporters to give the names of each column to provide evidence, not enough to impress and feel.
There is a suspected list of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who make it dangerous to reflect chaos in Mexico.
There are no breathing breaks for violence, and the more bodies are gathered across the country, the majority of them, according to the Journalists' Committee for the Protection of Journalists, are at least 25.589 journalists after the attacks and threats in December 2012 and have been killed by at least seven journalists in seven states.
Last killed include their editor and inspiring source, Javier Valdez Cardena, the accompanying carrier of Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His absence gives a deep sense, although his presence can be perceived anywhere in the Riodoce building fascade hangs a big picture of the middle finger of Valdez with the letter "righteous" and two reporters in the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing the T-shirts with his smiled glass face or his typical panama hat.
Reporters discussing a joint trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a separate state prosecutor was established for the handling of cases by journalists in 2010, only two cases have been taken into account by the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, which reach thousands of people who kill journalists, they rarely come to court.
Riodoce continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the information and justice of the murderers, Ibarra says that the meeting on security is not much good.
"It's a little silly to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
"By the time we don't know why, you're all distracted."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in the capital of Culiacan on May 15th.
He was only able to drive a few blocks before two men stopped him from the Red Toyota Corola, forced to leave the car and shot him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means translated "Twoth River".
The armed man drove out in Valdez's car and accidented in the neighborhood.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left a woman and two grown-up children.
Words spread freely in Culiacan.
However, only quiet is the essence of Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and released to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country since rival clichés are fighting for the execution of the power wax.
It doesn't matter that some or even several people are shot in the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the cemetery is full of double - decorated mausoleums of drug kings, which are larger than many living homes.
For a moment, let us forget that the time of peace indicates that only one cartel is driven by a state of the sea with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite everything and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers associated with his work, Riodoce has been involved and ismail Bojorquez (60) is aware of the enormous guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes helped kill him.
The first was the publication of the interview with Damaso Lopez, the noseman of the cartel competing with the sons of Guzman in the war in February.
This book may have pissed the sons off by suspect gang members, and they bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they arrived in the newspaper kits.
The second mistake was that Valdez did not have to leave the country for its own safety after the attack in another newspaper service that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be there forever.
In 2003, he worked as a veteran reporter at the Noroeste newspaper when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce by selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas was "unavailable to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
In time, the newspaper gathered a reputation with its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish strong research without fear of the censor, and readers were fascinated in a publication that they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the Prestige Maria Moors Cabot prize for its Latin America reflections.
In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Committee (ACK) prize for his courage to follow Mexico’s drug story anywhere it leads to.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said by accepting the AKK prize.
Last October, he said the interview on the TV of Rompevinto TV was that drug trafficking was a lifestyle in Sinaloa.
"You're gonna have to take the task of the journalist's office with another chance to play stupid.
I don't want to be asked what I did when I faced so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
The Riodoce Collective misses Valdez, a funny guy who spilled like a madrus, a friend who kindly shared his embezzlement and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He was always wearing his hat.
He went over the office to the El Guayabo bar and sat at the same table.
Now they ask her if her routine love got her fate.
His death has also led them to question themselves how to do best and survive their work.
"They don't like you hanging out with these women, their children, their legal business, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things were not to be touched," said Bojorquez.
The result is strong self - control and self - control even in the best times.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, said the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa no longer apply, just as they do not apply to the toxic association of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros and other states, which are home to profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is changing all the time.
The room where the workers of Riodice gathered for security training was suddenly no longer allowed for mobile phones; a few days before that, it was revealed that only the spider that was sold to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers in the shadow of the tree looked for relief from the heat of 40 degrees.
The government appointed them to watch Riodoce's office, located in a four-story building in the Middle Class of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered if these police officers belong to the 50 percent police officers whose governor himself has implicitly embraced.
It's been months since the reporters have traveled to mountainous rural areas where control is on de facto drug gangs.
The edition of Riodoce this week dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the former boxing agent Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter away from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was time to be cautious when it was time to write what everyone in town knows the restaurant is a place for both drug dealers and public authorities.
The reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered to the name of a politician who belongs to the institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all political levels almost throughout the previous century.
In recent times, several IRP governors have been accused of widespread reflection in cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous incidents at the same place, including how El Chapo's son, El Chapo's carrier Guzman, escaped from the military.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched for Valdez’s column to get information on kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known already what happened," said the 46-year-old Villarreal, whose dressy bodybuilding has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all the channels of communication have been broken with our sources."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for tags and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and redress workers have become something they never expected activists for the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of tags and headed to the office of the local prosecutor for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michocan.
The body has been found burned, and the officers say it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists have become more pronounced throughout the country and criticise the word "SOS press" as an organised protest on the walkways and buildings.
On that day, President Bojorquez will be gone in Washington, Washington, trying to collect international support in Valdez's case of justice.
The day after Valdez died, Ramirez’s authorities accused journalists of being plagued and murdered by telling the truth.
After that, he asked for him to be distracted from reflecting government activities, worrying that he had an impact on objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "limited" by organised crime, co-sidious state officials and independent society.
In his last book "Narcotic Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs but also done by orders of politicians and security forces, who are in the field of organised crime.
The Media Channel Monitoring Group Articulo 19 allocated more than half of the reporters' attacks to the police and public officials last year.
"In Mexico you're going to die because they want you to shut up," said Ramirez.
The murders are obviously blood-proof.
No one forgets the blog Maria Elizabeth Macias' death in Tamaulipas, the northern border state, six years ago.
His body was found with a letter that was probably signed by a cartel in Los Zetas, "I'm here for my report."
Behind his depressed head, computer cameras and headphones were lying.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in Chihuahua, the northern border state, after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others proceed as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo was murdered by their head in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke to the juarez drug maps in public with the "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists have fled home countries or even the country.
It's a nervous decision.
It's hard to find a job in the exile, and they still have to hide the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they're backed up, as probably happened to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in 2015 in a Mexico apartment three months after leaving Veracruz.
Those who stay still and continue to work will have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who ever wanted to be a poet, admits that she's scared by reflecting the drug business.
"The Mexican is on his way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
On the midnight of a recent Friday, when the latest number was already locked, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and took a beer when suddenly everyone’s phones were vibrating.
In Mazatlan, the coastal Kurt City, 19 people were killed by confirmed fire exchanges between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by several messages left by cartels in the region.
From the side of the sidewalk, reporters put news on the Riodoce website using their mobile phone.
Next day, the front seat needed a change.
Sirens blew over another firefighting in the area.
Bojorquez hired to the police in charge to see if they're on their watch.
Even if they were afraid, at least they didn't show it.
Under the massive portrait of the deceased founder of the newspaper, on which his middle finger is visible to the whole Sinaloa, the workers of Riodoce carried out his tracks.
"How could I even think about closing," said Bojorquez, "when the day Javier was killed, he asked me to send him to the streets for a report?"
Dinosaur used a protective color to prevent enemies.
At first glance, it seems like a shape, though quite scary.
Scientists have now disclosed the first discoveries of the incredibly renown sized creature discovered by the Canadian miner, which has been so well preserved that experts have described it as "dinosaur Mona Lisa".
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered with its spleens was red brown and his past had been somewhat "complex".
The report published in the Journal Current Biology described the nature as "the best preserved panoscosaur that has ever been found" and "one of the best dinosaur positions in the world".
Fossil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the critical period, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation of open scientists who describe it as "really significant".
According to the National Geographic magazine, this bodily-coated vegetarian is best preserved by this type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta in Canada.
He hit something that didn't remind me of the stone around him, and decided to look into it more closely.
Found fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrelli Paleontology Museum.
The next six years were working on digging the animal out of 2500 pounds (1100 pounds) of land.
After all this hard work, the final outcome is now finally ready to bring it to the public.
"If you get a little bit of an eye, you can almost believe he's sleeping," said the leading author Caleb Brown, the researcher at the Royal Tyrrelli Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur positions - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
When investigating his skin, researchers found that the vegetarian, who is covered with the spoons and looks like a walking tank, was likely to be significantly endangered by meat-fed dinosaurs.
This multitude dinosaur used red and white to hide from predators, and applied a eclipse technique called anti-secure, which is also used by many modern animals.
This, according to experts, allowed dinosaurs to better dive around and avoid enemies because the larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This 110 million-year-old nodosaurus family has reached the news for the first time in May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrelli Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now investigated the nature and called it by Mark Mitchell, the Laboratorium of the Boreopeta Markmichelli Museum, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to expose the animal for a hard time.
Thanks to the amazing good survival of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the stems on the body of the animal.
They discovered an antisafety - the protection method used in the animal state, which means that the upper half of the being was darker than the lower.
Although the parachutes are common, findings come as a surprise, because Borealopeta is much larger than the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was sufficiently actively hunted by other meat-fed dinosaurs, that evolution preferred to cover as a survival actor instead of the opposite.
However, most of the animals using today's anti-spraying animals - e.g. horns, sebras or carnations - are much smaller and more vulnerable as harvests, suggesting that nodosaurus had to make real effort to survive.
"The strong hunting of a dinosaur that is so large and richly coated with spleens shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the critical era could be," said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the salts also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists will continue to study the animal to get clues about this life, including the contents of this intestine, to find out what the animal ate for his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell to the river, thus reaching the sea with a flow, where he fell in front of the ocean's bottom.
At that time Alberta was as warm as it was now in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans were probably far beyond the inland as they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable, because it is fully covered with preserved spoon skin, while it has remained three-dimensional, retaining the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the period of criticism.
To reconstruct it, you don't have to use a lot of imagination - it's just enough to rub your eyes and it feels like she's sleeping."
The critical era was the time when huge dinosaurs — the theropods — were traveling on two feet on earth.
Although their all King Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopeta, some of his frightening predecessors could be hunted from this favored dinosaur.
These include Acrocanthosaur, 38 feet (11.5 metres) long and six tons of monsters weighing.
Scientists whose recent discoveries have been published in Current Biology believe that Boreopeta was chopped into the sea after death and it mummified in mummifished mud.
The existence discovered on 21 March 2011 Shawn Funk when he mined the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta in Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved in the world, including the skin and the spoons, and it is from a hollow to a hip.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five metres) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch squirrels came out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this spoon-covered vegetarian was adventured through the current West Canada until a flooded river in this opening.
However, the underwater burial site of dinosaur helped to preserve its spleens in an excellent detail.
The stoned remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains are still covered by the tops of the mygarical spoon plates along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic: "This degree of preservation is as rare as a lotto victory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Stuffed skin residues continue to cover the turbulence plates on the animal’s skull.
The right forefoot lies next to him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
I'll be able to count the spoons on his stable."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Who are the streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was completely shocked.
Only the day after traveling to New York, this one was sitting on a bed hired by a resident of St. Louis via Airbnb, browsing Facebook.
He was posted by his former schoolmate.
It says, "Police just killed a 18-year-old kid and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused why no one else had posted this information into his flow, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The condensed @TheePharaoh user posts were repeatedly distributed in his timeline.
A rapist from St. Louis's region transmitted a real-time pole to Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old blackman who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson in Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street for four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought of himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later the night he saw a reconfiguration that told me about the gathering of people on Canfield Drive this time.
Photos were distributed from police birds and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept the tag in a letter "Ferguson Police just killed my unarmed son!"
He was watching a real-time stream where a policeman stood in front of a group of protestors with a burial dog.
In the second video, another policeman said he was carrying a gun and screaming, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he hit himself, "It's unusual."
"It's not the kind of murder we're used to and what we could call typical."
I was feeling scared at that point.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return flight and traveled home the next day.
After he landed at 11:00, he went to his father for his six - year - old daughter and decided that they would ride Ferguson the next morning alone.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is the central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Who Streets?""), which presents in the cinemas on 11 August.
This is the story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and perseverance of those who live in this community and fulfilling the answers in demanding streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter, who wore a flower dress and had a proper crown on it, they again talked about a topic that they had discussed several times before this morning, about the experiences and living conditions of the black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for his rights?" he reminds himself.
"We're driving Ferguson right now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't take her," said Ferrell later.
"What's happening right now is the culmination of the past.
He needs to know it, see it, and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organisation, and also know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we must do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I succeed in raising him so that he does not experience personal racism, he does not differ from another black girl.
I feel like I'd do her a bear to protect her from this world."
The first stop they were doing at Ferguson was on the way to South Florissant, in a distant location across the police station, which had become a camp site of a kind, where activists were expecting news about Officer Darren Wilson, who was not finally charged with.
There Ferrell and his daughter connected their powers to the local business owner who made lunches.
They put food bags together and helped protestors share them.
For Ferrelli, slowly began to take the shape of a new type of activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he said, stating that when he was a student at Missouri-St. Louis University, he was the president of the Minority Student Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organisational experience.
It's all just shattered."
Weeks later, Ferrell met a film co-director of Sabah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and the film operator, Lucas Alvarado-Farr, were just trying to document what was happening.
The question was, "Do you try to document what's happening or find a story that can be used?"
Such skepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to benefit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson is not being heard, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already hit his hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the region known for activism in connection with sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrelli and six other locals who were watched by the group after Brown was fired for years.
"No one in this documentary speaks for us or us, but we speak ourselves," said Davis.
"It was important to me how these people were represented, because that's how they picture me."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrelli's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not a "rescue guide, but a community meeting," as said Folayan, he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Street?" is documented by surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as love and marriage to his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw a flanking.
"But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people must be accompanied by certain vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrelli’s story highlights and refocuss the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement, who thought in the social media in 2012 after the murder of a black teenager, Trayvon Martin, out of the theme reference #BlackLivesMatter, are homosexual.
"The leading role of black homosexual women is to keep the movement in general," Ferrell said, "and that is just because we have to fight on several fronts continually.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, stating that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women, and many of them are black homosexual women".
At the same time, he claims that "this is not a type of equal opportunities-- Ferrell was not selected as the center of the film because of his identity.
"He was the man from whom the right energy was blown," he said.
"But it's not a coincidence that she was right on the front line, because as a black homosexual woman living in such nodes, there's a lot on the line.
His energy can be perceived through the screen."
At the same time, the news cameras from Ferguson have long gone missing, but the racial links between the community and the police are still fragile.
During the protest, Ferrell's conditional penalty for blocking the road lasts for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy airspace in the area that he calls home, just "small-ass."
However, he still thinks it is important for a mantra that he has eaten in memory since he went to Ferguson’s streets three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
7 buttons to get past the North Pole after Weekend's party
Some of the strongest male boys will find help after a drink of a party.
Or they're coming from the word "out of the buffalo, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a decent fit for health.
What can you do to make you feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow, after the Weekend Trail or other parties, and get over the pohmel as painlessly as possible?
Drink some water.
Alcohol down and on, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid by drinking alcohol, it must be recovered somehow.
With water, minerals are also evacuated from the body, and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after drinking, it is particularly good if it is free of bubbles or only lightly cast.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure it wouldn't cost you to go to Grandma's house to break trees, that could be a fatal false decision.
But a light walk helps the body to remember what it feels like to be alive.
Being lying in the tent and laying out a poop is a more time-consuming way of planning.
Gently and with caution, give the body back energy.
If you're up to vomiting from last night, it's definitely not worth trying to load a large, fat steak to the pasture.
Start, for example, the fresh juice in which the fruit sugars in your body are slowly cultivated.
If you are already suffering from health around the south, you might want to try a puljongi.
And a little later on the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will release your body from the last water.
Like I said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on the painkillers.
If you take a painkiller for the prevention of a bonfire at night, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen and thus lose performance.
This way you ruin your liver even more, and the boars will be worse.
In addition, the painkiller doesn't last much longer in the body anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it with an empty stomach, it'll irritate you with a sober stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, get along with yourself.
It's about the same thing as walking, but walking doesn't get orgasm.
However, avoid excessively active pace and twisted poses during the pohmelli, physical effort should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Make a foolish talk with friends and co-scanners, make simple fools and smile friendlyly about yourself and others (shorts).
A joke and a laugh may not be throwing away, but there's definitely a lot more fun to deal with after-repairs.
One day, the buffalo goes over anyway!
The Northwestern professor and an employee at Oxford University are searched for suspects of murder.
According to the police, there is a national search for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who has become suspicious after finding the body of a man with lethal stabbing wounds in one of Chicago luxurious apartments.
According to the Cook County court records, the arrest warrants were issued on Monday, without the possibility of a warrant, to arrest Wyndham Lathem 42 and the 56-year-old Andrew Warren, charged with the murder of the first-rate murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau because of their alleged link with the death of Trenton.
According to the documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to the warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27th.
The police received a phone call and found the victim on the Grand Plaza's apartment when they arrived, whose body had several incision wounds.
According to the officers, Cornell-Duranleau was recognized as dead at the scene and investigators consider stabbing as murder while the police actively seek two suspects.
Lathem has been a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the University of Public Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now temporarily withdrawn from work and is forbidden to enter the towns of Northwestern University.
"This is now the case of criminal investigation by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates with investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior at the Financial Department of Oxford University.
The university and the representative of the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and ready to help US research agencies in every possible way."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
Anthony Gugliemi, head of the Chicago Police Department communications department, urges suspects to turn themselves up to the authorities.
"Polices have an idea where they are, but we are increasingly involved in defining the exact location," said Guglieme.
According to Gugliels, the local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
Gugliemi said that the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager who had just received a encrypted tip that something was happening at apartment 1008.
According to the police descriptions, it was a magical view.
According to the Gugliels, it is not clear whether the event itself also took place on 27 July.
He said security cameras confirm the presence of Lathem and Warren in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," added Gugliemi.
The Grand Plaza Board sent a letter to the citizens: "The police are currently working on the chronology of events and the victim's background and studying various motives, including the possibility of family disputes."
Stupid companies to help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Ellent wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees in her e-commerce start-up company, but the surveys were ineffective.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some workers did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Egrett, who runs the e-commerce company Madison Reed selling hair care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called out-of-the-art people to help.
A new type of human resources start-up companies are at stake to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licenseing software with a sure aim to measure the involvement of employees, they will enable companies to conduct sudden interviews, target certain teams and demographic groups, provide workers with anonymity and a hot line of complaints, and in some cases allow language carriers to pass through C-level managers and directly to the Bureau.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, the clinic and CEO of Redwood City, Glint, whose software analytics tool is used by companies to measure the involvement of employees.
According to Ellentti, he has received a much better overview of what his employees think and feel over the last three years of his use of Glint.
In addition to sudden research and specific team surveys, it offers a company's thermal map, which will give an overview of the departments in which the most complaints are available and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to identify the reasons.
Companies have come to realize that they need to stay informed of their work culture so that they do not become the next Uber, which has been inclined to scandals since the former employee published a blog post that described the harassing environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For starters such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and alignment could be worth more than $18.7 billion by 2020 according to the Let's Talk Payments website on financial technology statistics.
In Denveris Colorado, a start-up company that helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, this year, Uber’s suspicious reputation showed interest and increased activity.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent will allow companies to send adjusted impulse searches, collect confidential answers in real time and look at the heat maps from the problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous message link that enables workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And if the CEO is involved, the complaints will go directly to the board.
"The public opinion has been adopted by the regulatory authorities," said the founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if the company is found to treat its employees badly or unethically, the company may face serious consequences, such as consumer boycots, leaving workers and cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant with more than 25 000 employees in 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and operations and offer a easy way to communicate with the headquarters of the corporation.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the telephone number or e-mail address of the corporation headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a depressing and uncomfortable process, said the general adviser of Ruby Tuesday, James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor complaints from workers.
However, now that the company uses Convertent, there are possible problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that did not reach the leaders who acted in other towns or state offices, quickly identify and deal with.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360-grade experience of workers," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"And we will protect our shareholders from court disputes with employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and involvement of workers much more seriously in 2002, or after the audit company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations of Enron's scandal.
But only when "social media became mature," companies realized that they could not stop their laundry in public on the web.
"Before the use of technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of risk capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent was funded in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital to raise the value of the capital collected to $47 million.
In November, Glinti invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing from the total enterprise funding to $60 million.
Such investments will not come as a surprise, taking into account the interconnection between companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that modern workers expect more than before from work.
In competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, there are high wages and interesting projects that have just been on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they spend their time on a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, they feel that they are heard and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of the Department of General Benefit and Workers' Experience, LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glinti.
Investors earn income when companies belonging to their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If the analytical tools of the third party allow more commitment and involvement of workers, it is no wonder that they can find support.
The acquisition of data on the involvement of workers, according to professionals in the work culture, is important.
But these data are useless if the company's supervisors don't get anything on them.
In fact, if a company asks its employees for feedback, it can create expectations that changes are expected.
And if changes do not take place fast enough or not at all, it can lead to disappointment and a reduction in the involvement of workers.
"If you ask for 4000 proposals, you must be prepared for 4000 chats," said Kotter International President Russell Raath, who has seen how companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
'Cause if things don't come to the end, the employees will think, 'Have you actually heard me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Ellentti, Madison Reed, who now conducts six studies among employees, has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after obtaining feedback from workers disappointed in decision-making speed and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to address the problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, however, new data on employees are collected and it is hoped that in the long term it will lead to the longer-term commitment of workers in the industry, which is known for its high labour flow.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose clients, you lose companies."
The glorious star of the euro area is Baltice: incomes grow rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have been influenced by the Baltic States, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg, referring to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
There is a low debt burden, a rapid improvement of institutions and a business and free market friendly policy.
"Balt countries, together with Slovakia, are among a small number of euro area countries where real GDP per capita is significantly closer to the EU average," reported the Central Bank.
Although the objective is to ensure that the total production of the economy per capita is equal to the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle.
Low wages have led the Baltics to seek a better pay from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the Latvian and Lithuanian residents appreciated that their economies are doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech and Polish countries, this was somewhat less than the half of the surveyed economies in their countries.
NCAA's decision to cancel twice a day training makes Bruins' days long
It's almost 23 o'clock, when the trolley UCLA footballers stop to chat at the edge of the new training course in the campus of the team.
Some of them have chopped off their shirts by revealing their training camp’s first day effort to sweat the back.
For a large part of the team, these power makers offer a midday break.
Players participating in summer courses are heading back to the campus for final exams after three hours of training before returning to the Wasserman football centre next morning at 6.30 a.m.
"The next three days are a real trial for them," said coach Bruins Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA decision to cancel the exercises twice a day in order to reduce the burden of players, has actually extended their days - at least until the final exams were completed on Friday.
For this reason, the first three trainings were scheduled to start at 19.15 p.m. in order to fit the players in the very tight schedule.
The transition from two trainings per day means more days with one exercise - the beginning of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season and for the first time during Mora's six Westwood seasons, training takes place during summer courses.
They will have 18 exercises until 20 August before official preparation for the opening game against Texas A&M in September begins.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the NCAA rule change, although it adds another agenda point to the close schedules of the players.
"They have a huge burden for three or four days, and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they are breaking through this trial; they are struggling, they are great young.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really good."
Once the camp is finished, UCLA’s training is closed, but it is not a simple task, given a clear view of their squares from the nearby parking lot and the nearby Luskin center, a higher-class hotel that has already been hit by escaped by the protective net around the gateway.
From this weekend, the Bruins players are deploying the hotel, but Mora acknowledged that there could be problems with free rooms during the season.
"We take security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem and it's not too much to think that people can rent a room and film training from there.
If you have a record of your training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we'll use a security team on the eighth parking lot.
We'll do the best we can using what we have.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We have a plan."
For revenge to the Central Party, the Savisaare-Ivanova Election Union, Kristiina Ojuland, and the EKR, which is forced to leave the Reform Party, will be able to show the hopeful election union of businessmen in Tegus Tallinn - it seems that the election association of the parties, created on the initiative of the parties, will participate in the local elections this year at least as many as the parties.
However, the chicks are read in autumn, and the key question is whether they are able to share the disappointed voters enough.
Who's staying with the Savisaar?
If the support group of Edgar Savisaare has declining, it may be expected that the events organised for his electoral union will be considered.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and present environmentalists and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And can the reason why some of the faithful supporters and friends of the Savisaar are being excluded from the candidates in Tallinn seek that the "Saviaar List" of abductors, which is leading to corruption and suspects of corruption crimes, becomes a reality?
The music video filmed on the roof of the municipality, on the Russian-speaking populus, which is the senior part of the town of Lasnamäe; and, in any way, the primitive computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, the main character, must avoid the voices of the 16- and 17-year-old electors who are on the bike - is this the way that the Centre is trying to vote for the first time in election boxes?
We look forward to the idea of other political parties of a youthful electoral campaign.
If the Channel 2 or TV3 viewers are watching a black square from the beginning of August instead of a show of entertainment, there are two options left: accept that the free league will see only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and France24 channels in English or give a tenth of every month to some television operators.
There are probably also those who begin to rejoice publicly about free TV experience, but eventually, although in a reluctant way, pay for television images and advertising.
The appalling music, the noisy people and the garbage left on the streets are some of the unpleasant side effects of every major music festival.
But if you don't want to get a part of the noise, it's worth leaving the country home instead of hurting your head - and sleeping place for a lot of money for the festivals.
Washington changes the green card rules.
The media releases quoted by President Donald Trump, who said that a new US Immigration Plan was planned to change the green card rules.
The plan provides for a reduction of the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year, more stringent rules for the acquisition of temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The draft law will be discussed in two houses of the Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, as it changes the way in which the US gives green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law reduces chain migration and will replace the current programme.
The new application process gives advantage to candidates who speak English and have financial resources for their own support and skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump in the United States media publications.
Siberian seto young people move to town, pensioners return to the country.
Anatoly, Jevsejevi, continues the tradition of the famous gold miners on the Earth River.
He works 140 kilometers from home as the Earth’s additional river at the corner of the images as a golden car driver.
It's a tough job: two months in a row without resting days 12 hours of work, and then only ten days at home and again.
In the three years that was working in Artell, Anatoly has only seen gold once.
"There's a tough order: when you go in, you're thoroughly checked not bringing the vodka, and you're going out to take the gold away," says Anatoli.
Mare Piho is talking to the village of Haida with the local seto Jaan, who has told her a lot about her family memories in Siberia.
Siberian sets still survived arhaic culture will also be influenced by home-sets, as it is just as shocking, thinks the most far-reaching sets investigated by Piho Mare.
From his first exploration to Siberia this year, it will take 30 years.
During that time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How much of the settling were still traveling to Siberia at the end of the 19th and early 20th century to land here?
It's an unresolved question.
I'm saying $8.000.
I figured it out by the stories of the Siberian seto men who have thought about it themselves.
It's hard to say, because at the time, there could be up to 30 people in one group, but the passport was only given to the man.
The passport was given only one, but he had children, sisters, and other female relatives.
Look at the size of this territory here!
It was several times greater than the historical Setoma.
It had to be educated, managed in some way.
Sets came here as farmers, but their lives changed, because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture but also to the river (paying), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Peseter many sets later worked in the classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (when the Soviet power built the uranium plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the sets make the majority of the population in the region at that time?
Yeah, they lived compact.
In addition, the tradition of marriage and childhood survived a long time.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How different was the culture of the Siberian sets and different from that of the mother’s sets?
They're different, though what was brought here was never the same there.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
Then they also made themselves (manifest clothes), but they always made a difference between what was brought and what had been done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of sets, because it's colder here.
Food changed.
For example, Setoma's meat was salted, but it was just frozen here.

The connections with the motherland were spiritually strong, and it was considered very important.
It seems to me that this Setumaa is now starting to give back to it, starting to influence them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Setode delegation who came to visit Haida at the day of the Kingdom of Seto at the beginning of July and lived in homes for four days - J. P.
What's left is amazing.
"It's extremely easy to come and go away, because the city has a great place to stay: the railway knot and the crossing point of the roads," says the operosoist Reigo Tamm from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a city of militia, we have lots of nature, sports and culture, and it gets pizza in every corner.
Kill is the top-top city!
There's a small island near the White River, where the males are used to have a janite party.
"That's a beautiful place that doesn't look like from the train window," Rigo says.
Whoever is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
On river water you can keep a picnic and just make romance - you can look at the flow of the river and think for life and behind.
I've been out there walking with my bridesmaids.
The operasoist Tamm has been practicing between three bridges on the riverside: "Because this place is at the end of the city, no one will be able to resist if his own stories are smuggled."
"On the hill there is a wonderful view of Tachele, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter, and now, for example, discgolf play - a golf course has been made, disks can be rented from the sports center," says Reigo.
Old professors are going there with their disks, but I haven't gotten there to play yet.
Mr Rasmus Kul Kul should probably be invited to visit Tahele because he has experienced discgolf player and has disks.
He's borrowing me!
Reigo and Männikberg were inseparable during the childhood of today’s operaist.
At least during ski hours.
There are many tears, disappointments, and you will win in my sports life.
Not to mention broken snacks and skis.
"The whole city is now full of construction work, all this is changing to unknown," says Reigo.
But killing an old and tired blindhouse is a very attractive place to play summer responses.
I'm glad that in 2012 R.A.A.A.A.M.M. Märt Meos has accepted my idea and came to the summer theater with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with "Aleksei Karenin" just ended, on August 11, the railway station is "Recovery" when the old blind hall building is moving around in the 1980s.
"To August 11th-13th, the days of the city of Tapa, which, apart from the building of the Vassal building, have awakened open home cafes and are taking place for a series of cultural events, including the public's role," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city in those days.
In the small yellow cabin on the May 1, the museum has been on its way since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are a lot of exponents and a huge amount of information," praises Reigo to a place full of the history of Tapa City, most of which focuses on rail and military.
Reigo murmurs that if all the places proposed by Tál go through, the stomach will be empty, but luckily, the small town is full of cafes.
"We have so good restaurants, and when we sit in cafes, we sometimes feel that you are abroad," he describes.
The trained and young soldiers from Tapas spend a lot of time in pubs and caves, so when you sit there, it's a strange feeling that you're in Estonia and your hometown, but there's international company around.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from French or Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tents in Greece
The TV channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who announced that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
On 1 August, the police arrested a group of illegally tents on the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but the investigation is taking place right now.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the television channel bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased the limitation of free camping and already impose severe penalties on all who are caught by resting in a place not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Dogs teach wolves go breaking sheep.
After a year, the Hiiumaa farmers have to give the wolves "training material" from their herd - probably the wolves who taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu county have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leh.
The bubble was only three, a year earlier 124.
There are also data from the Environmental Agency that the Hiiumal wolves were not born and the Hiiumaa Hunting Council information that this year there are two fixed wolves on the island.
On Monday nights, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna and injured 18 survivor sheep.
On Wednesday morning, the wolves broke a sheep in Reheselja’s village, and severely injured the other who had to kill an emergency.
The rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Agriculture sent a draft law on the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and a draft plant protection law.
The amendment of the Law will give rise to the creation of a separate data collection for both the locations of genetically modified crops and operators, and will continue to be used in the plant health register.
In addition, the GM crop operator’s obligation to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in beekeeping in a defined radius is amended.
Although genetically modified crops are currently not cultivated in Estonia, we believe that clear rules are necessary for the coexistence of genetically modified and not transformed crops.
At least until it is decided to declare Estonian GMO free," said Sigmar Suu, head of the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Agriculture.
"It must also be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, account should be taken of the costs and administrative burdens incurred for both the private and public sectors," added Suu.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the data collection and management training of GM crop locations and operators in GM crops in GMOVS, lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and for the start of economic activities.
Specifically for beekeeping, the GM crop farmer has so far been replaced by the obligation to inform the beekeepers of the start of the cultivation of GM crops by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before starting the cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to get to know this in the information system of the drafts and, if they wish to, to present their opinions to the Ministry of Agriculture.
The proposed changes will affect, in particular, persons active in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the Agriculture Agency.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop is allowed - maize MON 810.
Until then, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in cultivating GM crops.
This is due to the facts that there is no maize damage in Estonia, a European varreléd, against which the cornline MON 810 is resistant.
The varieties of this maize line are also cultivated for the southern regions, and this maize is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture has commissioned studies to detect possible GM organisms in the seeds of various suviraps, corn and soy varieties grown in Estonia.
The results of the analyses of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and the study concluded that seeds of rape, maize and soya grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, from the above, it can be concluded that there is no consciously genetically modified crops in Estonia, and it has also been confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of "genius"
Jose Mournho believes that Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Matic in the face of "genius", after the middle player against Sampdoria on Wednesday night made his debut.
For 40 million pounds, the player bought from Chelsea started in the United's last seasonal game in Dublin before Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid in the first row of 2-1 wins on Tuesday, making an impression on the defense, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go to warfare.
However, following the Blues seasonal Asian tour, the Maticul was desperately short of the match form and only lasted for 45 minutes, according to Mourinho, it must be corrected before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a soccer mind," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him reach the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, the Aviva Stadium began in its initial order, the other recruited Victor Lindelo and Romelu Lukaku and Mourinho began quietly to set up their own first men at the beginning of the season.
The Independent published this week that Mourinho still wishes to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club has already made a "great job" by concluding contracts with three of his four priority choices.
"I'm grateful to the club that they were able to make three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four of them, but they've worked hard for me."
Another son of a bitch got on foot on the GSM transmitter on August 1, and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird observer living in the desert, became the first crucifixed Särves, and this nest is already flying around, has left the nest and joined the large pool of Mullutu-Great.
That's because Serves is not a crop field, writes the voice of the islands.
On Tuesday, relatively late to ring the cucumbers, another cucumber boy and that one on the island of Muhu was attached to the escort.
According to Martinson, the installation of escorts is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Mulu was provided with a son of cucumber named Mati GSM transmitter in Särves Türjul.
"She's doings on the Internet are everyone's viewing: how she went to Spain for winter, returning back to the German and Polish border, and then she came to Saaremaa," said Martinson.
The British inventor put a microchip in his body to get into the house and the car with a handclip.
The British inventor became the first person in a country where a microchip was installed so that he could just open his forehead, get into the office and even start the car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam set up a small chip between its thumb and index fingers and now offers this service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier through technology through their own company BioTeq.
He has joined the forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant in the Royal Hospital of the Hampshire County in Winchester, Hans, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
Technology is similar to that of a microchip installed in cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to process.
Northam’s company also replaces the locks of houses and cars so that they can be compatible with the chip, asking for a lock of 300 pounds.
This married one child's father has now installed technology in both home and in his car BMW Z4, which will start when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House expense cost taxpayers thousands
According to the military documents published by TIME, the White House decided to fly a marine helicopter last month for an American production event to the southern court to pay taxpayers up to $24,000.
The green and white colour of Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One on board of the President, was the central attraction of an event in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House, renewed industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
A helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a hunt from Maine, a fire extinguisher from Wisconsin and a strap truck made in Mississippi.
According to the documents of the ESC Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House's war cabin called for a partial order of the helicopter, or FARGO, almost 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern court for the "unconventional" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it was an unusually important event," said HMX-1 commander on the day before the event in e-mail to his chief, the Deputy Officer of the Navy in the field of aviation.
The message noted that the helicopter arrives at the southern court in the morning of July 17, at 7:00 a.m., and remains there until the yard was cleaned between 18 and 21 the same night.
It was added that if the White House had to leave, the return flight would be necessary due to the restrictions on working time to another ecstasy.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, and the eskader security team stayed close to the aircraft during the entire time that it was on the ground.
It was not possible to read from the documents provided to the magazine whether or not another ecstasy was finally needed.
The Hatchi Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
Documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and we were told not to violate," wrote the commander.
"You seem to have no choice," replied the Deputy Chief Officer.
The White House declared the event "made in America" to be an official event, and Hatchi's law wouldn't cover it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The President supported the efforts made by the health reform that was being discussed at that time in the Senate and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in control.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for a politically profitable purpose is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them as a purely photo session is unusual.
Trump was observed in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, rolled into the background of the president's plane, and his Twitter account was filled with messages that complain about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"White House is very pleased with the presentation of "manufactured in America" where the products were represented by all 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said Lindsay Walters, the White House press representative.
HMX-1 teams are often performing tests in the area of Washington and the southern courtyard to train the deportation of the President of the United States to the White House with a centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 in the White House held 58 pilot landings.
According to the official, the flight was considered to be the standard of "flight-made" flight crews that month's training flights.
Eskadar's helicopters flew that day for another 11 hours for "not-to-presidious support missions".
According to the White House, none of the other exponents of this event put a burden on the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky’s representative, the company was not involved in the organisation of exhibiting the helicopter at the southern courtyard.
HMX-1 does not maintain the budget documents for the President's flights and the exact costs of the event are difficult to identify.
But according to the annual prices of the Ministry of Defence for the year 2017, the VH-3D compensation rate is 24 380 dollars per hour of flight.
Eskadar’s documents indicated the length of the flight from its main base base at the Navy Quantico airport in both directions of Virginia for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is far below that amount.
"The calculation of the cost of paying payers on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the RAND study of 2015, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include staff costs, although they cover costs related to fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Sean Spicer, former representative of the White House, protected the use of a helicopter at that time's event.
"The point is to show you this week the stuff made in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security and that there are probably hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe, just like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked hard on.
So, of course, it's right to highlight this."
It's not clear whether Trump was in contact with a helicopter in the southern court of the event, or not, but he was sitting behind a firefighter.
In the White House, Trump called to the representatives of Sikorsky by throwing fun on the media publications about company products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - through tears came peace and joy
In 2011, in Daegus, Šadeiko was hit in the last area, 800 m ran a footstorm, and the stadium was taken out with a portrait.
Shortly before that, he had gained zero in the distance of the universe held in China.
In 2012, the Helsinki EMI broke the damage caused by cheap whiskey, but at the debutolympiad in London, he received a 23nd place in 6013 points.
However, the misfortune continued.
In 2013, the Moscow MM received an opening day after the schedule of the Estonian record a thumb injury in the Estonian distance jump.
Two years later, he received a 15th place at the Beijing MM and met the Olympic standard, but he had wanted more to disappoint the athlete.
Šadeiko’s most severe cable flag was just going through the bubble when at first a letter was not received by the Amsterdam EM in the distance jump.
I'd just like to put together a fair multi-competence one time.
"One time," Šadeiko squeezed.
The worse was ahead: a month later, his Olympic contest in Rio was interrupted at the first stage of the thigh injury.
Time to take off -- can we continue with the seven races at all?
Is the effort of two days still worth it?
She was thinking long, but she found peace in her.
I got my head clean.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I have thought that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and think clean.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pill in the bag yet," said Šadeiko about his self-cleaning.
I could turn a clean page and go on with a new move.
Coach Anne Mägi said it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the caretaker, but he realized that, above all, the athlete himself needs to find out.
I mean, he was so tampered with everybody.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up, and he wants to prove to himself what he was worth," says Berg.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He's doing it for his own joy.
The competition came back in May, when Šadeiko set up a new Estonian record of 6280 points during a multi-competence contest in Götzis.
In a high-level competition, he corrected his personal top-mark bullets by about a metre (13.89) and ran in a record-by-time barrier.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not a ceiling of abilities, but was erased only the primary thirst of competition.
The mountain who guided him for years says that Šadeiko is a model student.
He's a sportsman. He's good at training.
If something's wrong, he's gonna say it right away.
He knows his body and trusts his knowledge.
That's what we have to do.
I can't tell you exactly what to do, and we will follow it.
A new approach has also been found by Šadeiko.
"I'm not the one who's doing the training to the maximum," he says and says, the most important thing is getting the right sensation, because it also guarantees a good result.
The Lappiness of the Nearest Baby Makes You Happy
Happy emotions have also been offered to Šadeiko the happiness of loved ones.
Both her former training partner, Maris Berg and sister Grete, have recently become parents, and the multi-competitor has received support from new citizens.
"It's been very interesting," says Šadeiko.
One alcohol with a drink equal to the brain's "training".
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a wine fan that believes -- with wine, you can train the brain better than with any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neurologist at Yale University.
His words are not about alcohol or the way it affects our feelings and thoughts, but about the "very active" taste process of wine.
By sniffing the glass, rolling the wine in the mouth, enjoying it, and feeling the taste of it, we put our brains on the job to make wine taste.
Sheperd says that wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but it creates the way wine stimulates the brain.
He's bringing a comparison of how the brain's "sees" colors.
"The taste is not in wine, the taste creates the taste of the wine," says Sheperd.
The things that affect the development of wine are, for example, our age, sex, and even the amount of spear that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, advises me that wine isn't to get drunk.
"There must be more in action," he says.
If you take too much, the system is overflowed.
Excessive wine drinking can harm the brain instead of benefiting the brain - according to the 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
On Wednesday, the head of the UN mission to Afghanistan said that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of UN Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are candidates for local Soviet elections, three candidates for Vice President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate by emphasising the importance of women's role," he said in a statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women are fully involved and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections and presidential elections of the Afghan local councils will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has threatened, on its part, the electoral process that falls in line with the transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisable.
The elections of this year mark the first time when the power will be given peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the independent Afghan Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered electorate are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything more enriching for both the big and the small ones.

From the Philippines to the heart of the world, the Oilsack,
Bearded bags are a summer class, which has become a hitt product in recent years, which one of the right souvenirs must even hang on the hand and which, despite its modest origin, traders have been able to weld a hit suitable price tag.
A bag of beards is probably one of those things that have existed once in life and whose possession has not caused any special emotions.
It's just there, and if it's not, there's nothing broken.
But now the sacks have made a real race, and the fashions have changed their delicate designer bags for summer months for simple sacks of shoulders.
This is not just a beach bag, but it is so popular today as a street bag, and the braver women are even walking to the office.
However, first, it is worth clearing whether a summer clue like this still sits for the boss or is worth pushing the wet and the laptop into a slightly more official Sumadian.
However, in the case of faints, women have made a true summer love for their shoulders.
For example, when reading foreign moeblogs, the first thing is that the modegurmans rush on their holidays to the local market as the first thing they can do, and they're gonna get a pair of shoulder bags that they're loyal to for the rest of the holidays, and which go along the beach, the market, and also on the tails of their friends in the city.
Some blogs are so generous that they buy more bags from the market and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
In this regard, it is noteworthy that there is so much demand for sacks among readers that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably attack each other by hand to become a happy owner of a bag.
In some ways, this madness is also understandable, because these rare times are when in the fashion world it is possible to buy something that has risen to a hit for just a few euros.
It is true that clever traders have also discovered a simple possibility of making money in this area and thus sell finer luxurious brands for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably to make sure that the richer clients shouldn't feel like ordinary mortals who promote themselves with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana over a thousand euros.
However, the interpretation of Chanel's shoulder bag can be made up of EUR 6000.
Unlike most of the mohehits, however, the sacks are not derived from some great fashion, but their story began farther.
Iron bags are supposed to come from a far distance from the Philippines where they are carried wide air.
There is, in particular, an exploratory business, and the locals are very often not able to see them.
It is claimed that it originates in the 14th century and is fairly similar to a normal basket burst.
However, since the shoulder bag does not need to be so hard as a basket, they can be embedded with patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and more attractive.
For example, in recent times, there are particularly trendy bags with tinted ribbons or leather strips.
However, a letter of thanks may be sent to an actress, Jane Birkin, who had never been seen before.
By name, he adapted the shoulder bag to all kinds of dressing kits, and he didn't even think it was a lot to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
However, in today’s popularity of bags, the fact that caring for them is a hawk head and, unlike all other sumadans, they do not need to be cared with special means, but also water and wet towels.
As in the case of trends, brands, except for classical appearances, have come out with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can get yourself a fryed bracelet or a tiny shoulder.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes into fashion, but on the shoulder.
But what's the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, such a sack of shoulders, which resembles its style, is open and short, as well as shoulders, are considered classical.

GMB is concerned about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The company expects the managers of the cookie manufacturer McVitie to confirm the long-term production plans in the Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has silenced the Tollcross object on the future of the investment.
In the factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products are produced, more than 500 people work.
The company McVitie's owner in Platis said that they have invested an object of more than 5 million pounds in the last few years.
There were additional employees hired and the trade union's chairs are "the first to hear", if anything changed in the factory's activities.
In a letter sent to the company's director, GMB Scotland called McVitie's company to "release concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines".
The GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot get clear from the head of the object about the business needs of Tollcross and the future investment plan makes our members very concerned.
There have been a number of generations of families, and the workforce is largely composed of the local community and people around Glasgow, a key pillar for ensuring proper employment in a region with high unemployment and social exclusion.
Therefore, Glasgow needs an increased productive company in McVitie, in the light of the rise in housing costs and the chronic decline in production.
Pladis' representative said: "The director of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company responds directly to it because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between employees and representatives of the GMB was held in Tollcross, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the employees that, like all other companies in a highly competitive and unstable economic climate, we are going to look at our activities running - and this applies to all of our companies and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds of Tollcross object, most of it has gone into production lines and improvements in operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production object, and if any changes in the activity of the object are to be made, workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear it."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about the approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt.
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up in its efforts to lure Neymar into their rows, making a offer of 189 million pounds to buy him. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this recording quest?
This horny approach has opened the summer transition window, and Ligue 1 club is ready to crush more than double the current world record of the acquisition, which was established in the last season by Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds.
After the transition has been completed, Neymaris will become the world's most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, who will receive more than 500 000 pounds a week after payment from the PSG.
It is known that Barcelona is angry both because of the approach and the break-up of Neymar, although the source close to the Catalans Board confirms that the club has always cared for a football player since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the president of the PSG warn the soccer world three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in the award of a contract with Blaise Matuda in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who think about recruiting some of the best players in the PSG.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they touch one of our players, we're going to take them and we'll contact them," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to conclude a contract with one of our players, they're gonna have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, since the Spanish club had previously shown interest in Marco Verratt, the middle performer of the PSG, this summer.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave on any condition and that Barcelona could receive a relapse as a result of this interest, losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brex is seriously threatening to strike a wig between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland after his appointment in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from this," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders," he emphasised.
According to the Assetskar, it would prefer Britain to be part of the European Union and, as it is not possible, to become part of the European common market.
This would maintain current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure more smooth would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
As noted that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could definitely have this kind of agreement with Britain."
An alternative to this would be a return to customs points that would declare historical division and political failure.
"Truth to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of the daily life of Northern Ireland.
When visiting Belfast, the Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland.
The Márt Avandi, passed through his first half triathon: Ironman can pass through everyone.
Today, the largest triatlon festival in the Baltic States was held in the winter capital of Otepäla, when the half-long Ironman competition was located in about 1,000 triatles from over thirty countries.
The distance of 70,3 km was 1,9 km from swimming, 90 km from bike and 21,1 km from bike.
Among others, Märt Avandi victoriously finished his life in the first triathlon.
"I thought it would be complicated, and it was finally complicated," said Avandi in the finish.
Despite the complexity, Avandi realized that the triatlon is actually a powerful head for all.
"Not the distance will kill, but the pace will kill," he said, implying that, by the time it was possible, everyone could reach the finishing head.
Except for Ott Sep, "It's okay with the physics, but he can't swim."
The Avandi had been busy training since February.
Starting for 4-5 hours a week, and later for ten hours a week.
In time 05:34:12, he reached 270th place in general accounting.
Although Avandi lost both Raio to the Pirayo (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Lig (time 05:06:37), he won other rivals in the so-called 'prominent class' class.
Last year, Tanel Padar lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
Ironman’s series of Otepäma men’s estimates were crowned by German John Moldan at 3:58:27, the best of Estonians was Ivo the Great Time 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Dane won by Helle Frederiks at 04:24:01, while the Estonians, Maria Jänes, who lost Frederiks in about half an hour and received 04:58:58.
The Avandi passed a swim distance of 1,9 km in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in position 410.
