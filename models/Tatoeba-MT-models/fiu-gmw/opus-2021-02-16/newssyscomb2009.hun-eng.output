The victory of the right-hand popularists in Austria, total 29%
The two parties of the so-called major coalition have felt a weakening and a significant increase in the right-hand populist parties has been achieved in the first preliminary results of the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, has suffered a serious loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Alliance for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Jörg Haider, Head of the Provinces of Karintia, intends to return to national politics.
On the basis of the preliminary results, the strongest party in the country remains the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, but the latest 2006 elections have lost 5.5% of the votes.
The ÖVP, which loses nearly nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results that have been achieved so far in the history of both major parties after the war in Austria, and, in particular, in the People's Party who produce the forthcoming elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
At the beginning of July, when the UVP Coalition exited, the People's Party had a significant advantage before SPÖ, according to public opinion surveys.
However, the electorates obviously punished him because they let the government fail.
In the first responses to the results, speculations were made of the possible resignation of Vice-President Wilhelm Molterer and the current alpine cellar.
The observers believe that this can be done on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Parliamentary Board.
This development would probably facilitate the increasingly likely way out of the electoral outcome, i.e. the renewing of the SPÖ and the ÖVP major coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-hand Populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) in advance, 18% of the votes and 11% of the votes received by BZÖ - however, the Social Democrats expressed their fear of the recurrence of 1999, when the People's Party agreed to joint government with the Popularists (the FPÖ was still uniform in 2005, the BZÖ was replaced by the BZÖ), which even brought sanctions on behalf of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with any of the parties, and I assume he can return to Vienna for national politics, is obviously counting on this solution.
The Green Party also reached Parliament, which, however, has been somewhat lost from its popularity and has fallen from the third place between the Austrian political parties to the fifth.
None of the other parties crossed the four-pronged border and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian Relations Can Cold
If it fails to solve the problem of the Czech scientists declared for illegal collection of bugs, the Czech Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that there could be some confusion in the Czech-India relations.
The Minister published this in New York after meeting with Pranab Mukherdsji, an Indian partner today.
"If this was not resolved, yes, there would be a certain deterioration," he said after the meeting, which was made by the Czech incentive.
After the trial, Mukherdji told me that the executive power would be difficult to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that, in the case of Petr Švácha, the central government may negotiate with the local leadership in Darjeeling, which is subject to the law.
"Her problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherdji, the three-year prison sentenced Emil Kučera, it would be best to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Then you could apply for immunity against bail and wait for judgment, he explained.
Schwarzenberg proved that his partner expressed himself similarly during the trial.
"The supreme court offered a appeal, then it would be possible to save him," said the Czech diplomatic chief.
The only way to intervene in the whole case is by the Czech party, the convicted is to provide "competitive legal support", mentioned the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian party has already provided them with such assistance.
"We have a major interest in maintaining the best relationships with India with many years of tradition.
The Indians also acknowledge this," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he told the ČTK, his partner stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"In fact, we think that the arrest and prosecution of these Czech scientists is a serious mistake," he declared.
The question is whether the Indian party has made a promise to deal with the case, the Minister has been able to take the answer.
"I've received a relatively many promise," he noted.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
It's on the wall's electronic map where Australia and the neighbouring sea areas are visible.
But he doesn't care about the continent, but it's a point in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and the neighbouring seabed with it.
The territory is as large as the continent itself," says Luigi Santoszand, Italian lawyer, who belongs to the 30-member working groups of UN Division Ocean and Maritime Law.
Chief, Václav Mikulka Czech lawyer, Director of Division, is monitoring the explanation, which is sometimes complementary.
Work stimulus and enthusiasm prevail here.
The seabed hides a world rich in natural resources that is barely known so far.
There may be oil, minerals and other minerals, but also unknown living organisms, such as the key to developing a cure for cancer.
Seabeds greater than land
The coastal states nowadays are actively seeking new submarine areas.
According to the United Nations Convention, their rights are exercised, which were agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Japan.
It is primarily about the area of the so-called continental ceiling, which often extends a few hundred kilometers from the coasts of that country.
Such a country has the exclusive right to all sources of the continental plaque under the Convention.
"Simplified, we keep the part of the seabed and the bottom layer of the continental ceiling, which is the natural continuation of the underwater continent.
It goes beyond the coastal sea borders, often 200 nautical miles, solely beyond the economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by that country to the Committee which designates the external borders of the Continental Treasury shall be supplemented by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is legal and professional assistance to the committee.
The Committee has so far negotiated five requests for Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far only the last three countries have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
In the world, the success of Australia has recently triggered a resonance, which, firstly, significantly extended its underwater country.
But New Zealand has also won - the area of the seabed for the committee is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which means six times larger in its territory.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits resulting from the future use of the seabed are hoped to be invaluable.
Other countries continue to submit their applications.
They can do that within ten years of the moment of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the Continental Statue ends, the area of the ocean floor declared by the Convention as a common heritage of humanity begins.
There is no country here who has an exclusive position.
The right to extract in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not Klondike," says by overriding Director Mikulka by "some areas are legally clearly surrounded and their regime is set in the contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the seabed is now in the Czech Republic.
This former Eastern Block shares with other countries in the framework of the joint "Interoceanmetal" organization.
This organisation, under the Convention, received the status of a "trainer investor" in 1991, similar to the investors in some other countries.
It was entitled to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific.
The area examined by the investigator is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom of the sea was there, it's a copy of the Tatra under the sea.
"A total of 75 000 square kilometres of this area can be produced.
The area is a rich location of polymethalic cobalts containing nickel, ret, cobalt and manganese," mentions another lawyer, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Robert Sandev, a co-worker of the division mazedon, presents another example of a competition.
It reminds me of a potato or a little fantasy of the Golem with his life-inspiring magic words.
German special forces were present in the liberation of hostages
The Egyptian government requested assistance from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis, and the experts came.
When the situation became complex, the special units were ready, but they did not perform.
There are growing details of the release of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to information from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, special German forces were involved in the rescue.
In addition to the German Federal Army experts, the GSG 9, the German Federal Police Flight and the Federal Crime Agency, as well as experts from the German Technical Service, were also at the liberation site.
However, according to information from ministers on Monday nights, German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and then fled when they recognized signs of violent hostages.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as a support force on the ground.
"That was fortunately not done," said the spokesman of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
On September 19, the attackers abducted a group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian accompanyers in the southern part of Egypt.
After the kidnapping in the South Egyptian desert area, the hostages were dragged here and there in the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages remains unclear until now, as is the details of the liberation of the hostages or the possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the survivors arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier told me that the liberated hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't comment on the details of his release.
In Berlin, no information has yet been provided on when they return to Germany.
According to "Bild" newspaper, the five tourists and special forces arrive on Tuesday at the German Air Warriors Airbus.
The U.S. House refuses the rescue package.
The underhouse of the United States Congress, with a small majority, failed the proposed rescue package of $700 billion for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell deep.
The US Assembly rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets with 227 votes against 206 votes.
In spite of the calls made by President George W. Bush and the politicians of both parties, the programme, with which they wanted to stop the chaos on the financial markets.
The supporters desperately tried to convince critics during a dramatic action about the need for a $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Presidents of the Democratic Party, called to support the MEPs, even if the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn't even occurred," he confessed.
Dow Jones still fell by more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
The investors were concerned that the state rescue package could fail.
The index rose briefly before the end of the vote, so that the failure to publicise again.
Experts report further serious turbulences on international financial markets.
The implementation of the programme requires approval by both the Assembly and the Senate.
The directors are registering more and more reservations.
Good winter promises to German travelers.
According to a study, the turnover of the bookings for the next few months has increased considerably compared to the previous year - over 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak conjunctural prospects, the Germans’ travel interest was not reduced according to the study.
In the summer season bookings, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in traffic compared to the previous year – presented on Monday in Berlin the German Travel Association (DRV).
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of reservations for the autumn months is already higher.
The traffic of the travel agencies in October exceeded 11 per cent in October 2007, reported by the DRV.
These results are based on GfK data, which assesses the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates to the full market.
The Institute took into account the travel booked by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar price, travels to the United States are particularly searched for - said the DRV.
Here the bookings increased by one-third of the round.
In addition, the German destinations are particularly popular in Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as in domestic countries.
Mostly organised roads were searched," said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRC.
As a result of rising energy and food costs, organised roads "costs can be better calculated for passengers than for individually organised travels".
Among other things, passengers can save money by booking discounts or all inclusive offers – added Laepple.
The booking rate of the summer months was also very good, so there will be again an increase in traffic compared to the previous year - although another study suggests that less German tourists are engaged in travels compared to the previous year.
My first October painting
Without a stop, recurrence ballermann slags, litres of horns and design dirndile celebrities.
It's a debut on Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really compare much to each other.
She's blond, she's a TV showman, and she's got a size-address.
My hair is dark, I'm a student girl, and I bought my clothes in the turquoise.
But one thing connects us: We've barely been on Wiesen for three minutes, we're already running for photographers and filling up their memory cards - very flattering, and this is all on my first visit to Wiesen.
That's how we can make friends.
Looks like the cheap dirt's going to meet his purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist north of a white sausage trainer, my communion is still bound by the folklore.
But when she arrived at Theresienwies, it's not so bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears dirnd or leather pants; no one's looking squirrelly or embarrassed - everything's perfectly fine.
Strange sights at the chocolate banana stand are just my dirdly bribe.
A woman in Mönchen draws my attention that I did wrongly tie the bond, "You're free, you're in the middle, you're a virgin, right-handed, widow in the back."
In secret, I crossed the wrist from behind to the left.
"That's good," he says, and he laughs.
Others are getting less applauded around fine flirting techniques, and they wear a simple filthy base with the sign "I'm too drunk to dress up" and unquestionably display their naked backs.
The young man with exhibitionistic features is called Bob, and he also visited the October festival first.
Which you find very fantastic, extending the "aaaaaaaaaaaa" in a long time.
After all this, he'll tell me he's got rid of the contents of his earlier drinks.
Right next to one of the firefighters everyone thinks it's garbage.
So Bob's one of the famous "surfs in silence."
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol.
At 8:00 a.m., the paramedics go through the scene and take care of the poor couples.
Patient nurses always appear in a team - four at the same time carry a covered tent into a tent.
This works as for most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure plunged.
It doesn't look like who's lying in the alcohol cabbage under the carpet.
"These are those who are completely ready" cried out to me by one of the sanitaries on my question and then in the screen.
The police named the victim.
The police named the 63-year-old lady who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
The guy in Brentwood, Chelsford Road, Carole Paulson, had an accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in town.
He was transported to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later he died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of reckless driving.
He's been released against bail ever since.
Turkey's plumbing diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey intends to join the European Union, the European powers burned from the desire to deepen their entry into the Turkish backland.
On the east side of the Bosporus, perhaps only 20 steps from the European border, is one of the greatest relics of the failed empire ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a neorenessan style.
At least that's what the guidebooks write.
The building is surrounded by the end of the perrons, with one tower in each front corner, and it looks like a German rural town hall.
The stone's dirty.
The whole building's a little dilated.
However, in view of the inside of the store's tickets, it is obvious that the large-scale enterprise had its western gateway.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, with the help of the train that leads to Saudi Arabia from Damascus to Bagdad today, wanted to achieve its ambitions to take the Middle East.
During World War I, the German conquests collapsed.
His railway lines were attacked by the Arab Lawrence and the Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, disappeared.
The British colonial army has withdrawn from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestinian and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station wasn't even better.
In 1917, a ammunition train exploded and destroyed the well-developed top of the building.
According to Turkish sources, there's been a sabotage operation.
Since then, he's slowly ruined, and it's been a long way beyond history.
At the same time today, as the railway gate to Analtia and the entire eastern region, at least symbolically, serves as the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The Party of Justice and Development in the Government - the ACP - developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, disappeared.
The new policy is characterised by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Hamas and Fatah Palestinian groups, with Iraq, Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I got on a night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish MEP, Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of burst, which gave the famous documentary "The Night Mail" rhythm of the old world, I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is devoted to the new symbol of the world state, which turns its back on the past.
However, the ACP paradigm exchange with islamic roots represents the Turkish consensus.
This has caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a cab to the ACP office, a ultra-modern, stone and steel building, specifically designed for this purpose, which is located in a developing suburb, half-finished shopping centres and coffee houses. The latter meets the suited middle managers - men and women - to make business early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have included a right-hand politician in any other European country.
She wore a suit, a tie, and I'm sure she had a Blackberry.
"The objective of the Party's foreign policy is to help Turkey reintegrate in its immediate environment.
The Cold War blew up the order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from the back country.
He had to go east and west at the same time today.
He couldn't choose from the two.
He had to open both directions.
"But it's possible that you're forced to choose sooner or later?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to go ahead."
After that, he stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here has said almost mechanically: Turkey's relations with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea serve the same advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
It is as if the message was to be communicated that, in an overriding sense, the whole of Europe and Turkey can reach Asia and the Middle East on those eastern roads.
When I was back at Hydarpasha Station, after another night, mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemans who watched the rebuilding of this decorative building 100 years ago.
That they would have admired if they found out that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now mostly in Turkey's hands.
And as soon as I waited for the ferry to take me back to the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was called "a sick man of Europe".
At least then there was no question of which land to apply for this exciting country.
Reminded Lifeways: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes this: since 1962, as the Guildford Music Director Vernon "Tod" Handley (nekróg, sept. 11) led the Guildford Philharmonic Musician Music and Chor.
Based on his musical plans for the part of the city, he founded his wonderful youth choir, the Proteus.
They were only 21 years old, but when the Proteus sang his finale in 1979 - many of us were in the end of our 20s - we were simply not willing to take off the choir.
The name "Proteus" (name of the mitological transformer) was in line with the determination and ability of the choir to deal with any bag they put before - whether the bird or a piece of the Messiah; without escort or with a great orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young choir was often fascinating and always exciting, and we owed the man whose inspiration for music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod tell us, "We'll let the music speak from itself."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the bag.
So sing it."
Carmeter's technique was always completely understandable and accurate, but it's never typical or overreacting.
Whatever the music level was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about him:
If he ever lived a chaperone who was supposed to be a knight, Vernon Handley was.
I was familiar with him in the two decades he was conducting the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
In the past 40 years, I wrote criticisms about more than 100 concerts, but never, never disappointed, and often inspired them.
Tod Handley had the size and modestness together, which is very rare.
He hated those craftsmen who, alive with his words, simply "with some well-known battles all over the world."
Many of us will miss you.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your William Woodruff (September 25) necrology, he continued his economic history studies in Oxford in 1946, and in 1950 he became a scholarship of the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while he was constantly prepared to obtain his basic diploma, master's degree and PhD title."
It's from the author notes of Woodruff's work "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
From 1946 to 1953, he completed PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry under Professor J. D. Chambers, which he then issued in 1958 on the British rubber industry.
In 1950-51, he was actually in the United States with a Houblin-Norman scholarship and in the summer of 1952 at Illinois, New York and Harvard.
He left Nottingham for good in 1953 and moved to Illinois.
You can't know why Woodruff was so beautiful about his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Savior's Army
"J. Vicente Resino "Flamenco and life", I recommend his exhibition because the photos of black and white, documentary style are fascinating.
Their dependent simplicity and strength and respect for the people on the photographs have attracted my attention.
This exhibition is emotional.
"Resino understands the magic moments."
Second sales record at Honda
In November, Honda is starting to market the second generation Jazz.
It is true that your predecessor has already had enough passenger space, but the development of the new model's internal areas is even wider.
All of this is coupled with refined mechanicals, which make driving more comfortable and increase fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
That's how the second-generation Honda Jazz looks.
Although he was very similar to his predecessor in the new Jazz sight, he was made with a number of internal changes.
These include innovative designs, new carosseries, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before we turn to a detailed description of the new model, we need to tell you that the new Jazz came up six years after the first generation was thrown on the market.
So first of all, we can say that Honda has managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is less known in Europe, he decides on sales records on other markets.
For example, Japan, where 2002 and then this year Jazz was the most visited car brand.
In Japan, for example, almost a million pieces of Jazz have been sold since they went to the market.
The second market was the Old Continent with almost half a million examples sold in six years.
However, Honda would like to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
As the Japanese company sold 83.000 Jazz in 2007, estimates for the sale of 100.000 cars are set for 2009, which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda sold 8000 pieces of Jazzt on the Spanish market, representing 6.7% of the total turnover of Honda in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the Spanish subsidiaries are computing the 2000 examples sold during one year's rotation.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly reduce the decline in Honda’s turnover in Spain.
The company's representatives are predicting 22.000 copies sold by the end of this year, which represents a decrease of 4000 lower than in 2007, i.e. 16%.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1.6% last year to 1.8%.
I would also like to increase this rate by 2010 to 2%.
The Honda hopes you can achieve this by introducing a new model.
It would be Insight, a five - door - 4370 mm long hybrid, from which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 pieces worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the market distribution of Insight would be made by the United States, while the remaining proportion would be distributed between the Old Continental and Japan.
The introduction of Insight's trade after the formal Valencia presentation scheduled for January is due in the first months of the year.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become wider from all perspectives.
The length reaches 3900 mm (five centimeter longer), the width of 1690 mm (two centimeter wide) and the axle distance increased by five centimeter, i.e. 2500 mm.
Height, on the contrary, 1520 mm.
In addition to the sizes, the passenger space has become wider.
The larger internal space is guaranteed by the new carossery and the fuel tank in the middle - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, it has increased the full load of a double floor tank, currently 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres above the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes that these dimensions apply to the type equipped with a engine of 1,4, because the packing of the 1,2 Honda Jazz is 379 litres.
Some external modifications can also be discovered, such as rear-end lamps or optional panorama glass roof as well as easier access to rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors to the rear seats has been raised to 80 degrees compared to the opening angle of the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The second-generation Jazz engines are new.
At the beginning of its shift, this small model can be ordered by two engines of 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both resources is more favourable than the previous model, and it is characterised by lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while the engine provides high performance in all respects.
The output of 1,2 litres is 90 horsepower at a speed of 6000 and the maximum speed of 114 Nm 4900.
This engine, which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5,3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
And the other engine, which produces 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100 horsepower Jazz consumes 5,4 litres on average and the issue is 128 grams of CO2.
The crashing "while car"
In order to develop accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspiration from nature this time, quite precisely from the world of bees to its new invention.
The Japanese company designed a robot that avoids accidents following the bees' fly.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or the BR23C instrument may be the first step to develop impact prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. University of Technology have built this little robot in Japan, in cooperation with the research centre for Science and Technology of the well-known University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuciro Doi, the Technological PR and Research Director of Marks, BR23C is a further extension of the four-level safety guard cover in Nissan.
The robot will make the company's products more capable of avoiding impacts.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan security guard.
However, its role is much more important than that of the complex eye of the bee, with which he sees in all directions in an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers designed a so-called laser telemetry (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument shall identify barriers within a distance of up to 2 metres in the 180 degrees of vision before the BR23C, calculates their distance and send a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an operation to prevent impact.
"As soon as the barrier is detected, the small robot immediately changes the direction by moving wheels in a smaller or more angle to avoid impact.
The system is mainly distinguished from the instruments currently available, that in this case the avoidance maneuver is fully automatically performed.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the project's main engineer.
By way of derogation from the bees, the avoidance maneuver must not be directed upwards or downwards, and can not pass through only in two dimensions and only in the direction of the rotation of wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and in the way that happens in the bees.
That is why Nissan used a rotation function in the robot not only to accelerate and slow down, but also to avoid impacts.
"This device has to process data only every few seconds and react to them.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can operate with only a few dozen KB memory without interruption.
It may sound surprising, but it's not really gigabyte, but it's not even about megabyte memory.
This is the first step to develop the technology for immediate impact prevention, which, according to Nissan's estimates, can be involved in cars of serial production within 10 years.
The robot operates with lithium polymer accumulators which are easier and lasting than lithium ion.
In the future, the combination of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system may be an additional application option to allow the car to reach the end goal by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of Hypothesis
We have to admit that the US Fair Department has a lot of money that can be invested, and they have no sense of negligence.
Since the crisis in their necks and so that Americans don't get into the drivers of suspicious mortgage banks, they created a fun and informative online game of "Bad Credit Hotel".
It's the "Creasure Loans" hotel, i.e. the Galibas.
The accommodation and, in particular, the image of the reception chasmor suggests that we should consider again, twice, and even, three times, is the time of borrowing really just now.
And especially where to apply for credit, because it's probably the purpose of this thing.
The information available on the website is really useful, but it is little detailed.
It's more of a gangster than a public.
But what would happen if we added the game?
For example, a room of our dreams would appear in the hotel.
Actually, it's something, because we don't dream about buying a place...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital for the MUFG.
Morgan Stanley announced that it would provide a share in its capital to the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay 9 billion dollars for 21% of the company's capital after the price of Morgan Stanley shares has fallen high on the stock exchange.
A week after the preliminary agreement was released, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock shares at a unit price of 25.25 dollars, i.e. for a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price remains more than 19% of the book value of the securities on 31 August.
The MUFG invests further 6 billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities that provide a 10% return and their conversion rate is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley reported that the global transaction is based on a average rate of 29 dollars, which is 28% higher than the current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's share price fell by 6.79% around 17 hours in the medium term and closed by $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to speed up the transformation of bankholding into a company," explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week to diversify his activities, while being controlled by the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis calls for even greater caution from the companies registered on Wall Street.
By the way, the terms announced on Monday indicate that the agreement was amended in the last few days: last Monday, Morgan only reported that he would sell 20% of his shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
"One week ago, we thought that the share would be of general shares as a whole," explained Toshihiide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and prevent potential risks.
On the basis of the weighted average price, the MUFG pays 7% more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return on a single share will decrease by around 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG may convert half of its priority shares into capital shares after one year if the trade rate of the latter exceeds the conversion rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. up to approximately 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley will thus ensure that the funds from MUFG can make use of its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquid resources.
However, the group's spokesperson did not want to provide accurate information on its two new allies' strategic plans.
After mergering the MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase Tier I's solvency rate by approximately 15%, which will be one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan said that his balance was "definitely" improved since the end of August.
Over the past few weeks, the group has been faced with a major challenge, since the rate of its shares fell to half, while the cost of guaranteeing the risk of non-payments has fled into the sky.
This cost decreased on Monday, but remained high at about 12%.
One of the big investors' banks was left with the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This Goldman Sachs, which announced last week, was $15 billion, some of which came from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's company group.
Rafael Correa's statement on Monday, Quito
Reconstruction of the Republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
It's a common plan for Hugo Chavez, Bolivien Evo Morales and Ecuador's Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the pattern of his presidents and friends, Correa explained her ideas about the new Constitution.
It succeeded because 64% of the voters voted in favour of the referendum according to the official results of 80% of the votes.
Thus, 28% of the population voted against no, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were unexplained by voters.
The adoption of the draft Constitution required 50% + 1 vote.
On Sunday, both the two surveys carried out at the entrance of the voting offices and the calculation by a civil organisation demonstrated the vast majority of 'yes' votes with 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa, by the way, spoke about the victory of the constitutional draft from Sunday to Monday night.
"The Constitution has won a stunning victory," he said, "and he thanked the Ecuadorians 280 kilometers south of Quito, in Guayaquil, the Governor's headquarters.
As well known, Mr Chavez, Mr Morales and President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet congratulated.
According to the observation mission of the United States of America (OAS), the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. The main topic was a 444-facing text which summarised the principles of "new socialism" protected by the President.
The proposed Constitution places the state power in the service of the economy, keeping the state the right to "designing development" for a country that is essentially in possession of oil extraction by foreign companies and of the foreign currency sent by migrants.
The draft Constitution of Correa, elected in 2006, also confirms the powers of the Head of State, who may obtain mandates for up to two consecutive periods and is entitled to dissolution of the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that she wished to live with this option, and in February 2009 she will reconciliate for the Head of State mandate.
The President has already started introducing it in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population living under the minimum living.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian facility as a base for anti-drug measures.
Released 19 hostages in Chad
An Egyptian commander hit him on the kidnappers, who hostaged 11 tourists and eight of them ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days, from where they were transported to Egyptian capital on Monday afternoons.
The hostages were released during the morning in Chad by an Egyptian commander.
They appeared to be in a good condition, about 4:30 a.m., aeroplane arrived at the Al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to the international airport in Kairo.
The hostages were banned to report to the press and immediately moved to a hospital in Mád, the suburbs of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers have "not paid a ransom" - said Zoheir Garanna Minister for Tourism in Egypt at the airport.
The hostages were captured on September 19th at the foot of the Ouanat mountain in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where Safari in the field was attended. The group was then dragged from one of the 35 unknown hostages to the other.
The group had 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and a Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tourists, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Agypto travel agency organising the safari.
According to an Egyptian security manager, a 30-member special commander arrived on two helicopters to the scene where he was captured directly before the flow at the hostages.
"There was a firefight between the troops. Half the kidnappers were killed, the others escaped," said the leader asking for the silence of his name.
He also stated that a total of 150 people were sent from the Egyptian Flash brigade to Sudan, where German and Italian commanders were added.
The Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We must recognise that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service people and action groups," he said, without further details.
He also denied that the hostages were paid a ransom.
On the last day, the Sudanese Army announced that a SUV was arrested during patrol and that the kidnappers had travelled. Six of them (including the Chad leader) were killed and two were arrested.
According to the Army, the hostages were in contact with a Darfur rebel organization, the Soedan Liberation Movement (SLA-U) which was immediately defyed by the organisation concerned.
Lettres - The quiet majority of culture
The debate on the financing of culture is currently at the heart of newspaper news and election campaigns.
That's all we can do.
But they're still forgetting a piece of our cultural life.
Who will raise his word to illustrate the ridiculous amounts of small museums, archives, archaeological digestions and national historical monuments on the end of hunger death?
Which politician sea reminds the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and the buildings that are part of the cultural heritage?
Or the fact that neither in Quebec nor in Canada there are laws that really ensure effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of the castle in the Loire valley?
And the constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture and that this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Federation of Historical Societys in Quebec, 211 history, cultural heritage, archives and genealogics, more than 40 000 volunteers are involved in research into history and maintaining a large number of private archives and archaeological records.
These organizations often protect our legacy with my teeth and protest with the last power of the drowning, when real estate developers and decision-makers direct their bulldozers to our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will anyone stand up to protect the historical and cultural heritage?
Disassemble some of the Fortis Bank's Benelux Governments
The Benelux States will help with partial publicisation because of the impact of the American credit market crisis - as the first European - on the Belgian Dutch bank, Fortison: the three countries will support a financial and insurance institution with Hungarian interests with a total of 11.2 billion euros.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch governments have agreed at the highest level at the end of the week, involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition responsibility.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in Fortis Bank is the international money market crisis that has been ringing over a year and decisions on the bank can therefore be considered a precedent in a certain sense.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three States purchase their existing property in almost half (49 percent).
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including in particular the Dutch ABN Amro, last year - mainly insurance activities.
Fortis's shares started a steep fall last week, and in the second half of the week, there were serious crises at the Institute.
However, the MEPs agree that with an employee of 85 000 people, the bank is too large to be allowed to bankrupt.
The company's papers were only about 12 percent down on Friday, 14 years old.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the corporate managers, this is not realistic.
By the way, corporate governance was caused by market uncertainties about the adoption of the $700 billion American package plan overseas for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers were slightly rising.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed a new CEO for the bank.
The financial institution has also been looking for private customers, but no one has received a valuable offer so far.
The Belgian Government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry, they do not lose their money.
The bank's clients have not developed panic, but the accounts have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate account and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fowls in chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to conclude insurance contracts with the applicant based on information on the purchase of medicinal products.
Data protection professionals are afraid that the data market will become uncontrolled.
"There is a data protection programme which, in all cases, binds the use of prescription data to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be independently handed, otherwise we trust the steak of the chicken," quotes Richard Dick, the developer of the program that can follow the prescriptions of the medicine, Washington Post.
Insurers shall make the insurance premium and the amount to be incurred in the event of damages dependent on the health status of the applicant customer, and if the risk is considered too high, they will not be bound by insurance.
The person used to be sent for medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the light of the results of the investigation.
Dick came up with a much cheaper procedure for ten years: the pharmacy has easily obtained from the customer's identification number that he bought the medicines he's been buying over the last half of the year, and this is why the program itself concludes what disease and health condition he suffers.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol lowering, it suggests that your blood fat levels are virtually untreated, which are listed as a higher risk category.
Several versions of the programme are on the market, some also define a risk multiplier number, so the insuranceer is not in a position to do other than paperwork, although small difficulties arise.
Some medicines can be used for several purposes, such as certain compounds can be used against migraine or heat waves, but are also effective against depression.
The latter is considered to be a significant risk-raising factor for business insurers, not those above.
There have been separate companies for requesting and processing data, and before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacy, the patient will be asked for the consent of the patient.
They are now under the obligation of the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure to do so.
Some companies are now working on the results of laboratory tests and linking them to drug consumption data so that they can provide a more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and monitoring of use will be increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate health data protection law, but it applies only to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
Before the Congress, there is a proposal for a law that also confers control powers on companies specialising in reporting to the authorities.
Mr Richard acknowledges that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his programme, which would be linked to the explicit consent of the person concerned to the transmission of the data.
Another question is that the person concerned may deny the contribution, otherwise the insurance undertakings do not conclude a contract with it.
So the chickens are still referring to the goodwill of the fox.
Global Marseille menu
Dual trade between the European Union and India
Since the European Union and India are mutually leading trading partners, the agenda of the ninth Summit has been dominated by the other, mostly global problems.
Today there will also be a French-India summit, where mostly nuclear cooperation will be involved.
The European Union acknowledges that India is a rising democratic power that should be given greater attention to international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to reach a common nominator to support the permanent membership of Newdelhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was thus not cheeked at Marseille last night, and now the ninth summit.
Nicolas Sarkozy, French President of the Union, and President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Mr Solana, took the Prime Minister of Manmohan Singh, who was agreed to double it in five years, which means that they would increase trade to a hundred billion euros.
Given the rise in trade between 2000 and 2007 from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an excessively ambitious objective.
In view of this, the 20 bilateral civil aviation conventions with India have been summarised in legal terms, i.e. air traffic may be flying in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the consultation.
The objective is to balance the fact that, while the EU's first trade partner in India, Newdelhi is only the ninth place in the EU's line of partners.
The summit has given attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism - the latter in both parts - were condemned and acceded to the UN conference.
They also called for the completion of the Doha Trade Round, although both of them have a large part of their failure so far.
The EU has confirmed that it maintains its energy and climate programme, which means that it wants to reduce its emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
In addition, India agreed that a global deal should be concluded at the climate conference for the future, and that the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 % by 2050.
I would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and support the call for an international meeting for a review of the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Head of Government is going to the capital of France, where the bilateral meeting is about to make a deal about the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, French companies will be assigned 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors in India.
According to the intelligence authorities, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
Over 300 Italian books in Frankfurt
Italian publishers are represented with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting at Buchmesse's 60th.
The International Book Fair in Frankfurt this year awaits 7.000 exhibitors from 101 countries, 171.790 square metres, where more than 403.000 books are presented.
At the Italian Pavilon opening party, Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Culture Java and Activities, represents an exhibition area of 264 square meters by setting up a single Italia Point.
The celebrating opening will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Strucur" "Buchmesse 5.0 Pavilion", where there is an opportunity to present data, trends and prospects on the situation of the Italian book edition.
According to the data, the proportion of foreign authors in the Italian publishers market, especially in adult and youth publications, is continuously diminishing.
They found the plane of the missing billionaire Steve Fossett one year ago.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, who disappeared over the Nevada desert on 3 September 2007.
The wrecks were found on a 3000-metre high surface, near Mammoth Lakes in Sierra Nevada on the border of California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, the sheriff of Madera County, all the doubts that exist: "After the situation of the plane, we sent out a team, and now we can be sure it's about the plane that Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The US Transport Safety Office (NTSB) reported that a few hours after discovering the wreck, a study committee was invited to identify the machine and to determine that it is really the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on 3 September 2007 on the day Fossett started on a trip from Yerington in Nevada.
Yesterday, too, in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some personal belongings of Fosset near Mammoth Lakes' home.
Two IDs on Fosset's name, issued by Illinois Federal Aviation Control, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was filed one month after he disappeared.
The billionaire set up a number of peaks to put himself in history.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he first managed to fly around the earth with a balloon: two weeks alone flying.
Three years later, he was passing the land with a plane without landing.
A number of records include flights above the Andes at a height of 15/445 metres, executed by a second pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual, however original and firm-world hobbit ship with large surfaces and cleaned corners.
A few words so much for the Mercedes-Benz's latest "compact trainer" with which the German car factory tried to bring fresh stimulus to the market.
This is precisely the reason why the launch campaign of SUV GLK in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition halls from 17 October will be surprising and unusual.
For the ad campaign accompanying the introduction of a new vehicle, he lives with a media communication device that has not yet been known to this day, including by utopic 3D posters that have not yet been used by car brands in Italy.
The giant poster action, which consists of three stages, will dominate Milan's central shopping street, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first stage of this new type of media communication begins with a car's spatial presentation, whereby the new SUV, with special glasses distributed around Corso Como, will be visible in almost real sizes and threedimensional forms.
The image viewer will feel like the car's getting out of the poster.
Then, through the innovative Elamina8 technology, all the details of the new GLK will be visible at one time, and then it will become a common way.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotype advertising world of the automotive industry.
Will this raise the interest of future customers?
We'll show you who the Italian football puzzles are.
They're probably being excluded from the careers in Triveneto.
But who is this 150-200 boys and girls who are now being ashamed of all Italy? Members of the Ultras Italia group, who has been following the selection for years, and which, in truth, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They've never confronted the opponent's fans.
The group's core is right.
The main organizers are coming from Trivento.
Also from Verona, Padova, Triest and Udin.
These were joined by small groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact only a few units).
Italian flags were swept on which the hometown of the surfers was marked: they were removed on Saturday in order not to be identified.
They're following the example of the English scurfers.
In Bulgaria, you were faced with a real Nazi cheerleader, the Levski druckers.
The Italian Football Association provided 144 tickets to the Italian surfers. These were names-name tickets, so it was easier to control the cheerleader team.
The Ministry of Interior also checked everyone: there was no trial between those preparing for Sofia, no one who would have been banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian cheerleaders with a football record have refused tickets and exits.
At present, the Ministry of Interior is waiting for protocols from the sophisticated police and will then take the necessary measures: those who have been arrested or identified during the confusion may also be subjected to five years of banning.
It is an international ban, not only for visits to all the stages of Italy, but also for Europe.
So, our football players can't put their legs on any football course.
Fortunately.
However, we must also fear that the Huligans will be found followers — that is, that there are others joining these few hundred and fifty people.
"You have to choke this fire immediately, you mustn't excuse the one who behaves like this," said the Ministry of Interior.
So it's better to keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday's selected match day is approaching Lecca.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports Italian ultras.
Tomorrow, the observer service will meet, and on Tuesday, the Committee on the Security of Sports events, which may be counted on one of the sections of the Home Security Service, on the Secret Service on Supractical behaviour.
"Scanning the Duce-Duce and flying arm under the Italian hymnus?
This thought was expressed in a rather unfortunate way, Domenico Mazzilli, appointed a few weeks ago as the head of the Home Affairs observer (the post was taken by Francesco Tagliante and before Felice Ferlitzi).
Mazzilli was formerly chief of police officer Tries, the city where he has been active since 2002 in a cell that supports the Ultras Italian group.
What Mazzilli says is true, in Bulgaria, it is not forbidden to feed the Duce, but the behavior of that 150-200 cheerleader was disgraceful.
I'm not a sociologist, he added the first man of the observation service, but crimes must be judged in the country where the crime is taking place.
Until now, this group has not caused any trouble, we need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to go on.
But let's talk a little bit about the Italian hymnus whispering: it's not a crime, but, if I should say that, it's not even a good parent..."
