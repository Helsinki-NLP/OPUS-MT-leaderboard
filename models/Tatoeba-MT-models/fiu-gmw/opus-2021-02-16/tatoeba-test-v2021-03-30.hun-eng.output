Tom's got an addictive personality.
He was so curious that he opened the box.

It's May 5th today.
That makes me sad.
The film got mixed criticisms.
After work, it's cute to rest.
Tom filled himself another cup of coffee.
Take off the lights!
This is unbelievable.

You look exhausted.
It shouldn't be that hard.
Actually, he doesn't know anything about this.
Tom deserves to be free.
I'll come if the weather lets you.
He's got two dogs.
Innocence is a nice thing.
I barely know Tom.
There's no point comparing them.
You don't even know how important this meeting is.
We were both safe.

I think that would explain everything.
He went to eat.
Say and act isn't the same.
Talk to me.
This boy is Fisher Tomi.
It's going to last right now.
He was tennis yesterday.
Hello, how are you?
It's a beautiful suit.

Would you do that again?
When I forgot my promise, she got really angry.
I don't understand either.
Tom's drowning.
What time are you going to school?
Tom lives near us.
I was hoping she would recover.
I still can't tell you why.
He went there personally.
That's not too much.
He called me this morning.
No, no, it's up to me.
I have no intention of being selfish.
If I were you, I'd think twice about choosing this path.
I don't know which kid's yours.
One of my pockets is holed.

Never talk to strangers.
Are you sure?
Tom's a French teacher now.
I'm not home yet.
I'd trust my life.
It was hard at first.
I'm embarrassed about what he said.
I don't know if it matters.
How did the traffic accident happen?
I think Tamás wants to do it tomorrow.
Go ahead.

It cost a lot more than I expected.
My apartment is more comfortable than yours.
Science is important in our lives.
We love each other, but we don't live a sex life anymore.

We're planning on climbing the mountain.
They're the same age.
It's a crime.

I want to look different.
I was the happiest man in the world.

He walked before breakfast.
I got cold yesterday.

We had enough to eat.
Intelligent.
Did you know that?

I don't want to believe that.
You're not dead.
One of my kids is sick.
Listen to me, please.

He particularly insisted on it.
I don't think I understand you.
The options are coming, they're going.
I heard a scream.

Are you excited?
Try some.
He gave him all the details.
It was really great food.
The drivers must leave at least one metre wide band when they pass by the bikes.
Tom always tells Mari he loves her.
Everyone's been messing around.
Sit down and tell me how you got out of that scary gap alive.
Why did you come here?
I could have done it alone, I guess.
I'm surprised you didn't bring Tom with you.
We were all very happy.
I don't like it, even if he loves me.
Tom usually helps me do my homework.
Tom's sick.
You should throw this out.

Would you like to answer some questions?
How long does this stand there?
There are many big cities in Brazil.
Thank you for your answer.
That's very nice of you.

Why should we be interested in that?

That's pretty serious.
Dear.
I bought a new charger.
Your phone's off.
You can come tomorrow.
We should finish this.

You'll have to tell me the whole story.
Everyone's been touched unexpectedly.
I should have been there sooner.
I'm a town resident.
I suggest you let Tom go.
Can I get the curtain off?
The iron consumes a lot of power.

Go, but don't count on me.
They're paying me enough.
I was born in Athens, 1956.
That's an excellent idea.
It wasn't interesting.
Why should you be so sad?
Tom was robotic all night and night.
It didn't work at Tatoe.
Don't call Tom now.
I think I'm stupid?
Are you bored?
Are these library books?

Tom, you drive!
I'm here.

I have high-level education.
Hello, Tamás.
Tom's been working all day without a break.
Tom has many enemies.
What did you tell them?
Cars are expensive.
Where?
I want to learn history.
Jealousy is not the same as jealousy.
You're gonna help me, aren't you?
Oh, I miss you so much.
Who made this cake?
I don't understand the question.
Honey, are you all right?
Is that normal?
How did you like the movie?
Robi can't handle you.
Make sure Tom told you everything.
I'm telling you the truth now.
I hope I'm not interrupting you.
When was this church built?
Tomi needs you.
This squirrel has a nut allergy.
I'd do it if I had more time.

Fear was going through all of my knives.
Don't act like you've been shocked.
Let me explain.
Look what Tom found under the bed.
He gave her food.
The elephant is a very big animal.
Whatever I do, he says I can do better.
Because when I saw you, the whole room got beautiful.
Every writer suffers from inspiration from time to time.
Thank you for everything.
Go through the orange door.

You sure?
I want to change.

I hope you understand what I mean.
What do you want?

You know how to cheer me up.
As they fell, the courtyard was all dark, and the summer leaves whispered around him.
It's not a horse; it's a devil!
Tom's very lucky.
Looks like the bus was late.
Watch out for pocket thieves.
Let me tell you.
Tom lied about his testimony before the court.
Five plus two is seven.
No one saw fear but me.
We all liked Tom.
She's out of smoking.
Do you have enough time?
Pray for us.
Everything hurts him.
He stabbed himself with a needle.
Wash me.
My parents are both home now.
I asked him to date me, but he said no.
It's illegal.
I like to watch football games.
The best defense is the attack.
I finally got you.
When are you coming?
Tom's not stupid, he's just lazy.
It's a pretty big cocktail.
It is important that parents stand on the same side when child rearing takes place.
There's another reason.
They saw him go through the street.
I'm interested in Japan's history.
Please don't talk about it.
They know I know.
Tom told me.
Even though we're engaged, he didn't want me to kiss him.
You don't have to work today.
Don't ask me that much.
It's snowing here.
You can make a difference.
Yeah, and here's a photo of the farm where the cows are headed.
Education made me what I am.
The accident happened two hours ago.
You'd have better come with a boat.
He blew his ears.
Tom's hyperventilating.
I hate arguing.
He told the police about the traffic accident.
You don't live here, do you?
Our team is ready.
I feel better.
Tom's both uncles live in Boston.
Did you know his name?
Take care of yourself.
We have to get out of here.
Tomi, why don't you go to your room?
Tom translated the French letter into German.
You can buy stamps in any post office.
He likes cooking for his family.
You can't escape.
I hate fanatics.
He swore to stop drinking.
The quality of the translation has improved.
It won't be easy.
Don't think of me like a normal person.
Bob, please help me carry your luggage to the big room.
It doesn't make sense to get bored in the past.
Is this my place or your place?
Just in time!
No hope.
Same.
I want to be a guitar.
Do your job.
Don't look.
We don't have a minute to waste.
If you're around your house, what landscape and what buildings can you see?
How much money does he have?
Yeah, why not?
You have to forgive me.
Double or nothing?
I didn't sleep.
It's often raining on these days.
You want to tell me something, Tom?
Tell us what this is.
Which judge investigated the case?
I don't think he'd fly.
I live in Riga.
I'm meeting her today.
Hello, old friend.
Anybody home?
Sleeping is essential to health.
I'll make you a sandwich if you want.
Only one who lives here knows what's cold.
It's snowing.
He met a wolf.
It's the past.
I'm trying to control myself.
The dust was swept.
The cost of this dress is favourable.
He gave up on him to go abroad.
It's a very old book.
He always asks for your opinion.
It's ugly, rotten yellow, and it's not harmonized, but at least they don't gase in the dark.
It's a wise choice.
It's not that far.
There's a lot of schools in this town.
This town has a big TV station.
Ice bears are good swimmers.
I haven't had anything since this morning.
I'm still thirsty.
Do you know his name?
We should try harder.
Have you ever seen a shark greater than three metres?
Who escaped?
Let's ask them.
Please give me your papers by the end of the month.
It's unreasonable.
Tom's rude.
Do you have grandchildren?
Turn around, please.
I love her so much.
I was there earlier to get a good place.
Give me your passport number and date of birth.
I can never thank you enough.
It's a big bet.
Tomi showed Mari the way.
I need coffee.
Tomi's holding up with his question.
Tom put Mari on the shovel.
Tell him to hurry.
They were very happy when we arrived.
What are you cooking?
It's a grey stone building.
I found it in the attic.
Tom was waiting.
Look at you.
It's time to rest.
He explained the rule to me.
I'm resting.
This old building shouldn't be tatarized.
We can't get any more.
I took my shoes off.
Everyone's fine.
He needs this.
Tom's useless.
Hanni and Nanni twins.
Mary was wearing a pink blouse.
They're home.
That white building is a hospital.
Next year, Tamás and I are going to Boston.
You have a nice skin.
The snake's snake.
That was the only thing I had to do.
No speed limit.
Where's my parachute?
One of them is lying.
You have to do it.
My mother wouldn't let me wear a mini skirt.
For me, things are important to me than you do.
When was the last time you had grenades?
Tom didn't have much to say.
These are all mine.
He's not here yet.
She took her socks over.
Lift isn't in the building, I can't stand up and I can barely do it because of my painful knees.
That's enough!
I locked the door.
Death is one of two things. Or destruction, and the dead are not aware of anything; or, as they say to us, a real change: the migration of the soul from this place to another.
Don't freak out.
That was a stupid question.
If you read the book, can you borrow it to me?
If you finish saying not to be nervous, I'd probably not be so nervous.
Of course.
What are you doing?
I'll put my passport back in the vault.
Tom felt it was a waste of time to translate the letter to Mari.
He almost doesn't know anything about that animal.
Take care.
When Tom woke up, Mari was in the shower.
Get your ass out of here!
Everybody's steep on me.
The show's a success.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
Is he sick or doctor?
Tom was a nervous child.
The leaves become red within two or three weeks.
No one can live for 200 years.
He's still calling me from time to time.
Something's not right.
Don't be delusional.
I need a room close to the elevator.
He's probably asleep.
His fever's slowed down.
She must be Tom's brother.
It was you, wasn't it?
Can you tell me the name of this man?
I'm looking for someone.
You can't see the woods from the tree.
Can you talk a little slower, please?
I like green tea.
That was a tragic accident.
I don't count.
The rich will become more and more rich.
I don't have much time.
I have to go in the garden.
Do you think she knows that I love her?
I lived in Boston.
When were you there?
They're making typewriters.
The bahais' faith is very cool.
270 years ago, February 18th, 1745, Alessandro Volta was born in Como, Italy.
Your new boyfriend's black.
It's never a precision.
I tried to warn him.
Are these all the same?
I found it!
It's a big, fat lie.
They've been busy for hours.
She was born to be editor.
I was trying to forget.
Let's pay the bill for half.

What are you gonna do there?
That's totally normal.
What else?

Can you help me, please?
She saw Tomi smile.
You're in a hurry to reach the eight-hour train.

How old are you?
We're going to the classroom.
Tom's busy.
There are people that can be easily influenced.
I don't understand why I shouldn't do that.

I feel severe chest pain.
I'm willing to risk it.
How can you say that?

Stop yelling!
Time will depend pretty quickly if you read something.

Have you ever eaten in that restaurant where Tom works?
I hope it's gonna work.
I'm here to bring my dog.
Are they teaching French in your school?
You're poor.
Push yourself.

I must have heard that voice somewhere.
The doctor told her to go to the hospital.
I'll have breakfast.

It's late.
Back face!

Go on with what you did.
Eat some.
We'll take care of it later.
I'm Israeli.
They stepped into the woods.
How the hell can you wait to pay me for this?
Tom asked Mary where John was living.
If it hadn't been the map, I'd be lost.
I think he's coming.
It's a day for tomorrow.
Tamás left-handed?
Can you tell me exactly what you really want?
My wife left me.
We don't want anything from you.
You know where the problem comes from.
What are you looking at?
It's unlikely that Tom knows where Mari lives.
Three ice creams, please.
Tom's in his pyjamas.
I was waiting for you.
Tom's greedy.
No one lives in this house.
As far as English is concerned, no one can pep.
Spongy on it!
You're not gonna die.

No one sees my tears.
She was born in Mohamed Mecca.
Tom and Mary twins.
Mark words you don't understand.
Who's the smartest man you know?
I want it to be all right at this time tomorrow.

Keep this thing away from me.
Why didn't Tom take the bus?
The dress can be enlarged.
He's gonna shower ten times a day.
This is very white.
They left last night.
We've never had a concert in Boston.
Tom may not know why Mary isn't here.
Don't worry.
Good-looking people look good, no matter what they wear.
You compare apples with circles.
Tom's on the table now.
It's dangerous here.
I can't stand this noise.
It's really nice to meet you.
Tom doesn't trust anyone.
Tomi is rich, but Mari isn't.
We should probably go.
I like coffee.
You know who Tom is?
I'm willing to buy it for you.
We're meaningful.
It's gonna be a new day tomorrow.

Here's the sun.
What are you gonna do?
Tom was in charge of the attack.
Tom almost never eats cucumbers.
No, it's not my house.
I live in New York.
We're out of coffee.
Let's have a beer.
What would you do if this was your child?
My kids don't lie to me.
I'm not proud of my daughter.
This will never end.
They're both laughing.
I wish you didn't do that right now.
I was trying to help Tom.
Your soul is degraded to hell.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
I'm starting to get in.
Throw this down.
He won his love.
He missed a class.
Can you give me that cup?
In my opinion, Twitter is just a waste of time.
Come on, touch it.
Tom asked Mary the same thing that she asked me.
The moon belongs to no one.
We were born for a reason for this world.
I helped Tomi get his Christmas tree.
I forgot to buy flowers for Eve.
It's not why we did it.
She could have kissed me as a goodbye, but she didn't, she just walked away.
We're not that poor.
He's working for the salary, not because he's enjoying it.
I know who's hurt.
I'm an addict.
By the evening, the shadow of the tree reached the wall.
He's a good friend.
He made a serious scientific discovery.
Tom's computer has a secret file that stores hundreds of gigabytes of hermelin videos.
Why are you so tired today?
I've lost my appetite.
How many people do you think we should invite to the party?

I have doubts about whether it's gonna work.
Let's go wash.
He's not in love with sports, just like I do.
I have a phone.
Tom went back to the hotel.
Do you have a TV?
What do I do with Tom?
I feel better every day.
I feel cold.
What do the doctors say?
I forgot his last name.
Please, help me.
He didn't say anything.
Why are you apologizing?
Tom's afraid he's being deceived.
Did you know Tom left home?
He likes trains.
We're home today.
I saw Tom dancing with another girl.
No one was in the room.
Tom threw his girlfriend's photos in the fire.
I'll go tell everyone.
Step forward.
You're hypocrites.
It reminds me of a girl I've ever known.
I was on the list.
Give me my book back.
Although we've done everything we can, we know we're not going to win.
He was close to suicide.
That was my finger.
My mother didn't say that.
Tom didn't know his water heater was holed until he got a huge water bill.
This will be our secret.
Why are you restless?
I'm sorry, but I didn't fully understand what you said.
Last night there was a fire near us.
We better go, Tom.
You'll probably all need some sleep.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't eat this.
It's only a matter of time for Tom to get in trouble again.
I got on the plane.
Are you home?
Clouds are going around the mountain.
That's my problem.
How can I make you understand?
She's in the kitchen.
I should have done that with you.
I don't want to eat the same again today.
I assume Tamás was right.
Here's my membership card.
I'm the only one who made Tamás help.
Tom stayed outside.
One of my bike wheels is defective.
I don't often have lunch with Tamas.
It's over, isn't it?
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I'll keep him warm.
That sentence has not yet been translated.
Tom's expecting too much.
It's very depressed.
You don't come from the monkey, except for some.
We're fine.
Tom wants to learn to surf.
It's a tough day today.
Here's your bag!
It's an intelligent man who discovered something that's more interesting than sex.
Tom wears a squirrel costume.
He loved both of them, and they both loved him.
I can't stop laughing at him.
Try someone else.
Remember what you said.
Blow your hair off.
Tamás drinks just bottled water.
Personally, I find sucking more enjoyable than conventional sex.
This is unbelievable.
After a short wait, he started to shave stupid things.
I need volunteers.
Tom and I know the truth.
That's a crime.
Tom's gonna cook.
Do you have an e-mail address?
You got it, you're not ready.
Tomi knew where Mary put her car.
You should be asleep now.
Tom and Mary don't live in the same state.
Look!
Don't keep your bike in the barn.
Sometimes I go to a movie.
Tamás never lived in Boston.
Don't criticize me.
He was looking for something in the dark.
I'm not gonna throw Tom out.
Tom took a 20-dollar out of his pocket.
I didn't want to tell you that.
I'm not going to Boston either.
Tom should have gone home early.
Prices go up.
Clear the garbage.
I didn't buy the car.
How much is the bus ticket?
You don't do anything!
Is the French accent hard?
I see a house.
Just so you know, this is a very bad joke.

Thank you for being me.
They have everything they need.
He's always on my side.
Nobody likes a hanger.
He's comfortable.
It's all right, it's over.
The police arrested the intruder.
I like things like that.
It's up to you to go there or not.
Why did you become a lawyer?
I made a decision.
You shouldn't wait long.
Tom seems to enjoy the party.
Why doesn't Tom want to come with us?
What a mess!
How annoying!
Tom packed the boxes at the wall.
It's commonly known that bear likes honey.
We're winning.
Don't get tired of waking up.
I'll see you soon.
Did you ask them to wait?
I fell in, I was late for school.
Where's the phone book?
I'm fine.
Cats get mice.
He parked his car on an empty tent.
This is his Christmas present.
You know?
It's never too late to learn.

What a wonderful place!
I wish we could do something for Tom.
I'll keep that in mind.

We're happy to accept your offer.
I was walking.
It wasn't Tom.
Why don't we go out for dinner tonight?
Dreams have come true.
Don't fool yourself.

Can I ask you?
Guess what I found.
I'm a marine.
There's a lot of giant chickens breeding in Florida.
Tom's too young for him, isn't he?
Tommy, can you hear me?
I couldn't take the wedding ring off my finger.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
Tom's ready to come home.
He was like a father to me.
You're gonna regret it.
Help's on the way.
Do you speak French in Canada?
I wish I could do it.
Keep watching.
I hope you don't mind if I leave early.
Come as you are.
I expect you to join us.
You woke me up.
I'm looking for my phone.
He's hanging up.
No one can stop me anymore.
Who did you see?

I need a translator.
You understand the language of women.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
Attention, please.
I'm ready to help you anytime.
We'll figure it out.
The battery's dead.
He found a good seat for me.
Sooner or later, we all die.
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?
Have you ever pooped?

We tried to warn you.
I found their voltage very complicated, contrary to the esperant, which is very simple.
You better watch out.

It's washing today.
This is so wrong.
Tomi touched my hand.
Who brought this?
There's a floor full of glass shales.
These bananas aren't mature.
Let's hide behind the curtain.
But I don't have one.
I think you were right.
Where was the wedding?
I'm swimming in the river.
It wasn't the first time they did this.
The water is cold.
It was a beautiful summer day.
Sometimes I feel stupid.
This is a good hiding place.
Do you have any questions?
It's sabotage.
Have fun all night, distortion in the morning.
When are the elections held?
Tom's a supporter.

Which half won?
Tom's at home.
Tom cut off a piece of meat and put it on his plate.

The decision was neglected.
That's never happened to me before.

He told her to quit smoking, but he wouldn't listen.
Pack your clothes.
