Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, diagnosis to be mentally ill, and now she's doing art on the subject, "Man should have the right to his own body"
There are tens of patients reports hanging from the roof of the Project Room Gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts.
Every one of them says Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multiannual story about how outsiders have written up their interpretation of Auer and its identity.
They decided for him who he was.
"I wanted to tell a person about my moderate treatment history so that the violence of the process can be seen," says Auer.
At the process, he's referring to the sex correction process.
It is often a year-long study period involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will be launched on a transmission to diagnostic studies carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before that, he had used the estrogen he ordered via the Internet and was still very long in his own repair process.
He experienced being a woman, but according to the Finnish law, a person has to go through the repair process so that the sex can also be corrected legally.
Translaki, i.e. the law on the strengthening of the gender of the transsek sual (563/2002) obliges transsessive people to forced sterilisation, for example, to obtain the right sex in the population register centre and passport.
At the moment, each gender repairer is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of reproductive incapacity.
You have the right to decide on your own body.
"This situation is inadmissible and infringes human rights," says Auer.
Translate reform has been mentioned in Finland for a long time.
The UNHRHR Council has given eight remarks to the law and the European Court of Justice has a preliminary ruling which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to exercise the sovereignty.
The previous Finnish Government prepared a change to the law under the direction of the Minister of Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovise.
The elections came and the main Finns rose to the government.
Now the change of law is still stuck.
It is internal political disputes that are not even related to this law.
"Government does not want to raise it on the table because there are differences within the government with the amendment of the law," says Frank Johansson, Director of the Finnish Department of Amnesty.
Two major installations are in control of the front of the exhibition.
One of them is packs and instructions for use by Auer.
In the patient report, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the psychologist of the transpole of the University Hospital in Tampere in Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote on this basis a report that should be defined for the treatment of Auer's court and for the benefit of assistance.
The consciousness of the perceived reality is exposed to deterioration.
The perception of the investigator of himself appears to be fragmented in a borderline manner, and the instability associated with personality becomes emphasised.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these photographs.
"I was shocked to hear that I was diagnosed to be mentally ill," says Auer.
Even more shocking was when Auer was not given gender correction.
According to the nursing staff, his resources were insufficient to initiate the process.
He was banned from his identity.
Then, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpole's waiting arrow on TV.
Later, a work of that television was created by the Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflexed his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person designated as a woman can increase his breast, but to remove the breasts, he needs a diagnosis," says Auer.
Your body is not yours if you experience no other than the number of your sexes determined by the birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not his only quality.
The gender correction process is harder for many spiritual reasons than for purely medical operations.
The people who pass through it meet dozens of people who need to be justified by their own existence and the right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment, insisting that their resources are not sufficient," says Auer.
Many applicants have psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible harassment experience.
In this respect, the medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
"The prevention of care and assistance can cause a person to become even worse than what it was before the process started," says Auer.
Auer's own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: “I have had self-destructive thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something that people are usually hard to melt.”
Depression has been treated with drugs, and when Auer started using hormones, it made it easier.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in childhood and teenage.
Why the wide chin didn't seem to fit in his own body, and why the breast had to be rounded instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer was that there are people near him who see him.
It's a basic need to be seen.
"In fact, you have to justify so much by speaking, dressing, acting sound and moving," he says.
Today, Auer is already experiencing sight, he exists as a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, the spontaneous comments of close ones may have hurt a lot.
It's the most hurting thing when a loved one is wrong.
"They should know, and they know who I am, but they don't agree or are able to intercept it," he continues.
However, not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body culture, i.e. body conflict, where the body or parts of it may cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long research process, it is not possible to obtain official confirmation for its own sexes.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," says Auer.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for recognising legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right of self-determination with regard to legal sex.
A full-age applicant shall submit a written application for a new identity indicating that he is experiencing another sex.
After a period of six months of consideration, the applicant shall confirm its application in writing and the Ministry shall give the applicant a new identity.
This right of self-determination is also required for Finland and the exhibition of Auer is also crystallised.
It has not been a therapy experience for an artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art is still a priority and that it can bring about political changes at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Rights Organization gave a travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP, the African Civil Liberties Organisation, has issued a travel warning for Missouri, which is due to the discriminatory practices of the State and the racist attacks there.
"NAACP’s travel release for Missouri will enter into force on 28 August 2017, calling on African tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to pay extreme caution when travelling to a state where a number of recent events on the basis of questionable races have occurred", states the organisation’s report.
The recent law in Missouri hinders the export of cases of discrimination to the law, and the enforcement of state laws is disproportionately affecting minorities, according to the NAACP, led to the provision of a travel warning.
People's citizens' rights are being violated.
They are stopped on the basis of skin color and being abused or killed," said Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri, to Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of one of the many cases in a short time."
The travel document for Missouri is the first warning of the organisation for the United States of America.
The organization mentioned examples of racist comments against African students at Missouri University and the death of the 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in a questionable situation earlier this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and Missouri's police arrested him even though he wasn't charged with a crime.
The travel report also referred to Missouri's Minister of Justice, saying that the police will stop a black driver by 75% more likely than a white driver.
"The purpose of the travel notice is to urge people to be careful and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"Mens must prepare, for example, by taking money to pay guarantees or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in 2015, there were 100 acts of hate crimes in Missouri, the sixteen most of the United States.
Travel warning is also an answer to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for companies to challenge justice for discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACLU, which defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws which oblige the police to arrest people for immigration violations.
In general, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs publishes travel warnings, and they concern other countries, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Upper: Lintilä asked Finnair to report on the supplementary pension of the CEO
Mika Lintila, Minister of Economic Affairs, responsible for the management of the State, has requested Finnair to report on the supplementary pension fee received by Pekka Vauramo, CEO of the airline, according to Yle.
According to the Minister, it is inconsistent with the state's will.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 received by the Vauramo was raised this week when the Helsinki Sanomat news about the development of the remuneration of the heads of the stock exchange companies.
The Finnish Photo Paper news about the supplementary pension of Vauramo in February.
Finnair said that he would give up the additional pensions in 2013.
The State has ordered that no additional pensions would be used to reward.
The state owns more than half Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the policy decision on the management of the owners last year.
The sanctions immediately intensified the speeches
A while ago, it seemed that the relations between the United States and Russia are on their way from cold to warm.
The United States President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia appeared to have a great deal with each other in connection with the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
Since then, the atmosphere has become considerably cold.
New economic sanctions adopted by the United States Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were reacted smoothly in Russia.
The most shocking response has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, according to which Trump's signature is a "full-scale trade war".
Even if Russian reactions were only to be part of political rhetoric, the aggression between the United States and Russia is a fact after the short month after the election of Trump.
In the United States, the transit of the Sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
However, the Congress accepted the law with considerable unanimity, but the adoption of the law to the President was, according to what has been said, considerably more difficult.
Trump criticizes the law he signed for "significant deficiencies".
President Trump's frustration must have been due, in particular, to Russia, although it must have been disgusting to adopt a law restricting his own rights.
As well known, an investigation is being conducted in the United States on the possible involvement of Russia in the presidential elections as well as on the connections of the Trump campaign to Russia.
The aggravating between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short month of cheerleading.
Once the staff of the White House has shifted tightly and various scandalous reverses have almost been revealed to update, it seems more and more clear that foreign policy is not done in the United States under the leadership of the President, but despite the President.
Such a situation is certainly not desirable.
If the Russian relationship is a riot in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's nuclear area also exacerbates relations.
The EU has clearly demonstrated the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained at least unified in its Russia policy, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State that trades a lot with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real problem.
The impact of the new US Sanctions Act is still unclear.
The EU has been afraid that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, the impact may be felt in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant.
In Europe, acidity has been caused by the exclusion of sanctions, for example, of liquid natural gas lng, which is important to the US economy.
Commercial sanctions are a means of provocation in world politics.
However, economic sanctions must be very considerate and precision.
Otherwise, they are easily more damaging than benefiting.
Isn't anything holy anymore?
The White House of Trump is now aimed at the Freedom Statue
Missing the stains is a sure sign of a change of power.
The Americans know that as well as others: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, destroyed Saddam Hussein's statue in the Firdo Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideas of Trump's administration, knew well what he was doing in a struggling debate with Jim Acosta on CNN. The patrol of liberty became targeted by Miller in a vocabulary of the President's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by the huge flocks of cruisers and imitating characters of the Freedom Patty.
His attack was the significance of the statue, especially the fact that in 1903 Emma Lazarus’ poem was added to the statue — 17 years after the statue was completed.
So Miller sets out Acosta: "I don't want to go to its history now, but the Pate of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem was added later, and it is not part of the original freedom patriot."
Miller was not wrong on his own, but it's not just about history, as he said himself.
Essentials are Lazarus' touching words, the only quality in which the state calls not only immigrants but "the poorest": "Your tired, your por, / Your huddled masses yearning to break free, / The wretched refuse of your making shore."
The poem is now more timely than ever.
Miller did not practise literature criticism and made it clear that the poorest are not welcome to the United States of Trump.
The debate on the importance of the freedom patriot is part of a broader political and cultural debate on the importance of the United States.
Lazarus’ friends campaigned after his death for the poem to be attached to his statue and knew well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to display the links between the French and the American Republic with a classic symbol, the female corpsification of freedom.
Lazarus changed the meaning of that: In his poetry, a female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the deported.
The imagination of poetry was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nationality.
Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, and the right body has long wanted to turn it back into its original.
In 2010, Rush Limbaugh, a programmer that can now be considered as a prophesying sign of Trump, claimed that the Freedom Patt will not be called to anyone, but that is the early foreman of the New Conservatives who will take the U.S. to the darkness to cover the world: "Lady Liberty will come out.
He'll take the freedom to the rest of the world from the United States.
"The call doesn't show a way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The importance of the freedom patriarch depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but wishful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and challenging journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His path of freedom comforts him by giving hope and by welcome.
And that's what Miller and Trump never want.
Their tone does not show the way, but the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Sports Championship 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the British Country Team
Elidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scotches got into the British country team.
Neil Black, CEO of the United Kingdom General Sports Association, says that the 16 Scott members of the World Championship team are "significant confirmation".
A record of Scottish athletes has been selected for the global sports competitions in London on Friday.
Black says that in Scotland there is something special that UK general sports must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for so long that we understand what it is about," says Black.
"I worked with the representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they thought it was related to the activities of the Institute.
And the Scottish Alliance believes that it is related to the activities of the Alliance,
and the United Kingdom General Sports Association believes that it is behind their activities.
And a regular streetist thinks he's got something to do with it.
However, this is something very awesome, which is why it is."
Many scots athletes compete seriously in London for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah on a 5,000-metre run.
"Elidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was amazing," says Black.
"The investigators were proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, irrespective of where to live and practice.
"Elidh's words had real feelings and passion for sports."
Eilish Doyle is the silver mitalist of the Championships of the People's Community in the 400-metre fence, and these are his fifth world championship competition. He thinks it's "unfaithful" that there are 16 Scots in the country team.
The previous record was from seven years 1983 and 2015.
The midway runner Laura Muir has been running five UK and two European recorders during the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London, and it's also worth keeping an eye on him: a man has a great season behind him, including profits in the UK MM and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championship contest, when the only scotch of the country team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the country team says he's "excellently proud" that there are so many scotches involved, some of which are seriously competing for final spots and medals.
"Access to Captains is a great honour, but it is even more special because the team members voted for the captain," says Doyle.
"I am, of course, very proud of all the scots that got into the country team.
It shows how far we've been.
They are acquainted as athletics who are competing for awarders.
The captain's speech?
I thought it went well.
I concentrated on how lucky we are when we have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the public at home and that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there, and I know that the atmosphere is going to be amazing."
Prevention of critics on Facebook: Do not qualify for public service if you do not tolerate criticism
Our country's father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but soon the newspapers began to criticize him for every possible domestic policy of his political principles.
The criticism must have annoyed,
But he didn't shut down his critics.
"If the freedom of speech is abolished, we may be led stupid and quiet as to slaughter sheep," said Washington in 1783.
That's how we get to Maryland's governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented their performers.
The United States Civil Rights Union brought Hogan before this week.
His staff regarded the challenge as unfounded, and it was also degrading online.
"What difference does it make? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters.
especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the amazing popular Republican governor of the state of democracy.
He has received the second best estimates of his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to the hot tub.
He's driven the state firmly and firmly in line with the principles.
He has also been able to use Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and published a picture of the clamored out of chemotherapy.
Therefore, preventing users from entering the Governor’s Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor’s page is a public and official forum that his staff maintains with tax assets.
Hogan's mediator, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor in his interview with Washington Post, who said it was just a moderation of comments.
However, stamping commentators into trolls, spies or haters is a too easy solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users that were prevented by Hogan on Facebook.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to discuss with the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors.
They said that their comments were respectful, kind and appropriate.
In his comment, the priest quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan’s Catholic belief.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Maryland's Bowie was not hostile, but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I was politely disappointed that Hogan had not taken a position on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in the Washington Post news comments.
"I cannot accept the fact that, once more people comment on the same thing, they will be seen as an organisational force in some way, and the citizens who are concerned as a large group will be ignored."
The Governor's staff called comments "a central attack", someone else could call them to promote the most important things.
In the Facebook era, communication is easy to control by preventing critics or removing critical comment.
Earlier, the staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical main papers, or to arrest and silence protesters.
However, it is actually the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official who has been accused of linking Facebook and other social media channels.
The Twitter users who stopped President Trump have sued him.
The first important decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to James C. Cacheris, the Alexandria Supreme Court judge, the Loudoun County Government violated the first increase in the US Constitution by preventing the voter from being elected on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Liberties Alliance held a discussion with the Republican Governor of Kentucky Matt Bevin on Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
During Washington’s time, the cost of postal charges was similar to that of the Internet today.
The number of newspapers was fourfolded from 1776 to 1800, and the anonymous writers rubbed Washington.
There were already trolls.
Marks Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers where they complained about Washington's decisions.
The president's office was filled with petitions that criticised Jay's agreement, the cooperation, trade and maritime agreements between the United States and the United Kingdom, and this is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion are the fundamental stones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
Avian summer meal should be stopped immediately.
The samples have come from about ten places, plus online announcements of couples, three.
Most of them have become Southern and Varsinais-Suome, but then the individuals from Haapavede and the Wall River, special investigator Marja Isomursu Evira.
The green wings have died of a glow of tricomonosis.
It's caused by a scientist called Trichomonas Gallinae, a primitive animal.
It has previously been known to hit the ducks, especially on the lips.
However, in the 21st century, the disease was also detected in pelvic pelvics.
In 2009, he's gotten a pretty good look.
At that time, tricomonosis caused a major collapse in Finland’s green pot, and since then the species’ strains have recovered.
There have been sick green beads now, but at least not at the large scale, the museum master Juha Honkala of the University of Helsinki (Luomus) tells us.
It is fearable that the previous epidemic of green bishops will recur unless anything is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: to stop the summer meal of birds immediately.
More about the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field at the Renaissance Club
The former European first player, Ronan Rafferty, hopes to benefit from the home field for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organises the 25th Senior Open in Scotland.
Rafferty, a Northern Irelander, led to the tournament held in Archerfield Links, next year, before the last round, but eventually lost Paul Eales. Rafferty has enjoyed a new place and acts as an ambassador for the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will be able to complete its gloriousness," Rafferty says.
"The players see the field at their best, and it's in great condition.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's an enthusiastic ambassador of the game, and he's proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great show for this field."
The English Eales is defending the championship for the first time, even though he has won a 32-year-old career for both Europe's tour and a European challenge tour.
"This feels like a really special opportunity," says the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend Extremadura Open's victory because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's wonderful to get back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back to mind: the tournament victory was a wonderful thing for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a great time we'll always remember."
Gary Orr comes back to real work on his own soil, and he went on tour after 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first event in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Toying at home is always more meaningful than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing games again, and I've played pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The triangle will be followed by the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Sensors' Major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
There are six Scottish tournaments: Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmair and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Parking a car costs five pounds if only a driver is in the car, and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK Cancer Cancer.
The barrack solved potential internal air problems.
At least no internal air problems have been found so far in the Pori Brigade in the barrack building, which was reported on Thursday.
Internal air studies will continue.
The investigations began when the man who stopped his armoring service for health reasons assumed that his health was deteriorated because of the poor inner air of the barrack.
According to Colonel Mika Holma, the head of the Pori Brigade, there are no problems in the health situation of other guards.
It turns out that this was a case, and no other servants in that unit have had health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clear this matter thoroughly.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any internal air problem, says Holma.
The press release of the Brigade said that because of the arrival lot in July, goods had to be moved to the barracks, which may have resulted in an immediate increase in dust.
That may have made the air seem intact, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use her food.
He's only rarely using the rooftop, too.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital city of the region of Pania, located in the restless Papua province of Indonesia. When he prepares a meal, he usually puts a bata – locally "nota" – directly into his fire.
In half an hour, the burned batate will be eaten harshly with naked, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Dege’s home, and he sits on a dirty painter, where he usually carries out his daily wool, such as washing in the same water that washed up from a nearby swamp.
The office of the hill will be delivered by the emmer in an obscure room.
Degei is the youngest of the four wives of his husband, and there is no land for him to be treated.
Much marriages are common here.
Too late work can be dangerous: most of the village's men are unemployed, and many drink a lot, and the soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one is afraid to walk into the village after five in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare clutch on the top of Papua, the former Holland colony, which was attached to Indonesia in 1969. The accession was preceded by a controversial referendum, where 1.026 village fairs were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupants.
The Dutch autonomy industry, which opposed the Dutch power, quickly turned its hatred to Jakarta's government, which has strict control of the region and prevents the access of foreign journalists and human rights observers.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua-New Guinea.
The Enarothal is a remote and a coin. The journey starts on an hour and a half from the capital of the province to Jayapura to Nabire and continues on a 5-hour driveway on a rental car.
There's no public traffic here.
In the city of about 19 000 inhabitants there are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo trees, whose wavelengths have been painted as clock browns.
Only few Indonesians have visited here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papua Mee Pago tribes worshiped the God of Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have these clothes," Degei says. He means his colorful, hand-wrapped hair, dark skirt and bright blouse.
"Before we had only leaves covered by our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, and 28 percent of its inhabitants live below the poverty limit, and child mortality and incomparableness are the highest in Asia.
But it's also the gold country of Indonesia.
The Paniai is about the top of New Jersey, with 153 000 inhabitants. Only about 100 km from Panama is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company with its residence in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine produced gold and copper worth $ 3.1 billion for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated 78 billion dollars of wood.
However, these riches bring evil to the priests, for they mean the repressive presence of the strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid almost $20 million to local military personnel and local military units in 1998-2004.
The demands of the Papua for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are silenced.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has since 1969 killed over 500 000 priests and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass deaths in the top of Papua tribes in the 1970s received the dimensions of genocide.
Last year, more than 3,900 people were arrested in peaceful demonstrations by the Indonesian police.
The Brisbane Archbishop report We Will Lose Everything from 2016 contains reports of the cruelty of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture — rapes and electric attacks are particularly popular means — and inferior attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"The number of victors is difficult to calculate, because there are weeks of cases," says Andreas Harsono, a Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch.
The body has been blackmailed when Papua's natural resources attract immigrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the Province, 83 percent are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing when the Indonesian populated islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes move Muslims to the region in the hope of a better livelihood.
The Japanese warung dishes sell baked chickens and gado-gado vegetables in peanut sauce.
It's hard for the locals to compete.
"Moderns have started selling chickens and vegetables on the market cheaper than locals," says Abeth You, 24 years old, who is from Panama and moved to the capital of the province for work.
"The local women lost their clients."
In his 2014 electoral campaign, President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, promised to intervene in the injustices and violations of human rights in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 areas, including in Panama, on his way to the President's castle of Jakarta.
But only a little has changed on Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts broke because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we expected him to meet our wishes and restore justice," says You.
There was only two months after Jokowin’s postures on some kind of wavebed in the pania.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs along the fire at Enarotal on December 7, 2014 when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use the headlights.
One of the soldiers didn't like the remarks, according to the local pastor Yavedt Teba, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and Witnesses, the drunken soldiers captured the children and assaulted them with a rifle.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was in a coma as a result of an assault.
A few hours later, the building of the National Election Board located near the scene was on fire, and the following day began to happen.
About a thousand Papuas — young men, women, and children — gathered in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They had hunting lines for celebrations, and they began to play the traditional waita dance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe, where they dance in a circle and track the song of birds.
Some of the protesters began to rock up the police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere became hot, the soldiers were commanded in the internal radio system: "If more than three times the crowds are making resistance, shoot them dead." The information is based on an official document seen by the TIME magazine, which has not been published to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto region, invented the situation from the hands of a devastation and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot at the left wrist," he told the Times on the porch of his bright-colored wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from soldiers' rows.
"A lot of shots were shot in the trunk."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I drank to him and made sure it really was him," said Yohanes to the magazine in a sad way. Like many Indonesians, he would use only one name.
"I saw that he was dead, I kissed him."
The police officer Yotje Mende in Papua told the reporters that the police were just protecting the police station because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, the police reporter of Papua in 2015.
"So it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many were injured.
The following day, the information about the deaths came into Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi held an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing his sympathy with the families of the victims and promised that the violence of Papua would be dealt with.
"I want the case investigated immediately so that it never happens again."
In October 2016, Minister of Security, Wiranto said that he would launch reports on human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he began to cancel immediately.
" Most of the offences happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 21st century.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but that requires certain processes," he said.
In the interview of the TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he was not going to start his studies on Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he told me.
The UN blames Wiranto on "criminal crime against humanity". Criminals relate to the death of more than a thousand people in the bloody vote on independence in East Timor in 1999, Wiranto said to the TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Panama.
The families of the victims of the Paniam have a vague disloyal view of the claims.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired of this."
He says that he is still living in fear, even though it has been years.
"Yes, I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army's gonna arrest me, and I'm afraid I'm gonna be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panics are afraid to discuss the event.
He tells me that the soldiers had abused him when he had helped me bury four of the victims.
"Sotians are looking for me after the burial of the victims," he says.
The shootings aren't over.
Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbourhood of Pania in Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between villagers and the head of the construction company, which began when the director refused to take the man who lost consciousness to the hospital.
The man who needed medical treatment was the 24 - year - old Ravianus Douw who had been forced to fish in a nearby river and died on his way to the hospital.
The hostile villagers showed their minds on the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned cops that responded with warning shots.
According to the locals, however, the paramilitary police force in Indonesia opened fire to the crowd, when one villager died.
"We're terrified, we're afraid of revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded people brought to the treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the police shooting and the displacement of a mobile police unit.
Paniai has always been the problem of the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development contributes to dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in Papua's middle hills.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), the Rebel Army, who claims to defend the rights of the Papuas by random attacks and the kidnapping of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Panama, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by randomly arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Panama in the name of "procurement of national sovereignty".
Some of the arrested people will never return.
Among the Papuas, Paniai is known as a "destructive, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is only a small amount of rice to be sold in Enarotal, and it is too expensive for locals, too.
like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly batates and some fruits and leaf vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five potato fields.
Most of the harvest is to the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten batches only cost 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the differences in the income of local and migrants have increased and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened to Nabire airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to better trained and wealthier migrants than locals.
Only a few beans have sufficient capital and skills to run their own business competitively.
"Youths do not want to stay in the village because there is no work and no money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Council.
It's the world's narrowly paying attention to the wild beans.
Furthermore, the restrictions on international news continue to be strict.
In the past this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were banned from Papua, although they had been granted a rare description permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, Deputy Director of the Human Rights Watch, he has not held his electoral promises; he has not increased transparency and has not promoted development by removing the restrictions on news.
"Indonesia's restless eastern provinces from Papua and Western Papua have new risks: the refusal of visas and the entry into the black list," Kine stated in its opinion.
The lack of freedom of action in the press means that the Government of Indonesia is only pressured by the neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to examine the 'multicular and widespread infringements' of Papua, including the Panic shooting scene.
These countries have traditionally also supported the liberalisation movement in Papua.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a mediator of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, disputed the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations".
The locals want the governments of the external authorities to be involved.
When the official Dutch delegation, led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4.5.2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says that the meeting was an anonymously maintained source.
There are presidential elections in Indonesia 2019, but the Papuas say that they are not likely to vote for Jokowi anymore.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who have been involved in the Paniatian shooting," says Gobai Chairman of the Council.
He wants Jokowin to know the situation of the Panics: they live under greed and unpredictable army power in lack and poverty, practically without health care and training opportunities.
According to Goba, the Panics, like the others of Papua, consider the votes they gave to Yokow as a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the people of the victims of the attack on Paniah showed opposition again symbolically: they buried one of the victims in the country opposite the police station and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says his head was wrestled.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora is barking about Robert Helenius's relaunch: "Even if his own fans don't want to see."
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisoran, the heavy boxers of the series, were meant to fight on May 27 in the Hartwall Arena.
However, the fight was canceled for commercial reasons.
Chisora plays a new interview with IFL TV about the reason for flopping the replay on Helen's shoulders.
My fight in Finland floped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he sucks, Chisora boring.
Helenius and Chisora first met in the full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the fight with a controversial score.
In May, Nisse Sauerland, its promotor, told the Italian-Sanom that the match had been transferred to the fall.
There's never been anything new from the fight.
However, the withdrawal is no longer bad for Chisora.
The fight would have probably been canceled after Chisora became ill.
Thursday, three days before the game, I woke up with heavy pain.
My bitch was exploding.
At the hospital, they said I had to be cut, Chisora tells me.
Britt says he's in about 45% condition right now.
He's not interested in a replay with Helenius, he's targeting Dillian Whyte.
Chisora was defeated in December.
Fire once again in the Torch Cloud in Dubai.
The flames conquered the world’s highest numbered residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee a building of 337 metres high at 79 floors.
This was a second fire in two years in a building called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied, and no one knew was injured, and the reason for the fire was no idea immediately after the event.
"We were sleeping and awakened in the voice of the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran the stairs down from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes," said the guy named George told Reuters.
According to Dubai’s rescue authorities, fire extinguished at 4:00 a.m. local time and left to cool down the building.
The government announced that they would arrange accommodation for the people who left their homes.
The case may raise questions about the safety of materials used in the outer surfaces of high buildings throughout the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Torch building board carried out a study in which it found that the plates used to contain and isolate the most damaged.
In Britain, the police believe that the insulation and curtaining plates of the Grenfel Tower in London could contribute to the rapid progress of the flames in a fire where 80 people died in June.

In the United States, more than 20% of air travellers take out prohibited objects, reveals a survey
A survey conducted by air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had exported prohibited objects informedly or unknownly to aeroplanes past the inspection points of the United States Transport Safety Agency (TSA). At least six per cent of the passengers had knifes or other steel objects that they knew were not banned.
Less than 1 percent reported that they had only later known that they had carried weapons, ammunition or explosives in error.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the survey, and it was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules.
19,7 per cent of passengers informedly violated the TSA rules were representatives of the Y generation and less than 15 per cent belonged to the X-Generation.
Most commonly, the rules were broken by taking food and liquids into the plane.
More than three per cent admitted consciously taking steel objects into the aeroplane, and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported that they had taken the prohibited drugs informedly to the aeroplane.
Travellers from across the United States participated in the survey. The survey company wanted to find out how many of them had accidentally taken the smuggling goods past the security check and how many had done so informedly.
It is not surprising that most travellers are also most likely to pass the security check – consciously or without knowing.
But, as the company that asked, TSA's instructions are quite complicated and confusing.
Passengers often don't know what liquids they can take into the plane and how much.
So it's not surprising that most of the TSA's imprisonments are liquids.
For some time, there was also the idea that you shouldn't take books to the plane.
We can take the liquids to homeland flights, but not to international flights.
Scott Pruitt, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, decided to delay the decisions taken during Obama period to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states had challenged Scott Pruitt, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, with the exception of Pruitt, withdrawed his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce the emissions of the EPA during the Obama regime.
According to the Pruit, the change shows that the agency which it has chaired takes better account of the needs of the environmental decision-makers in the States.
Pruitt did not mention a plea which had been brought against his former decision in the Federal petition court.
States should begin to comply with the level of ground ozone level 2015 as from 1.10.
In June, Mr Pruitt announced that he would move the implementation of decisions for a year forward so that his agency would have more time to learn about the plan, as the Agency did not want to intervene in local decision-making or harm economic growth.
Pruitt was the public prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as the leader of the EPA, known as the opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions taken by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden change in mind of the median week is the latest drawback on Pruitti’s plan to mitigate the provisions.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington adopted a decision that the Director of the EPA exceeded his mandate in attempting to delay the implementation of the Obama Government Decision on oil and gas companies, which obliges companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In its mid-week opinion Pruitt argued that his full translation of ozone provisions would only strengthen the cooperation of the EPA with the States in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"In the past administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines, and then waited for the activist groups and others to challenge it to the right to reach an agreement on timetables," Pruitt said. In his previous action, he challenged the Agency for the environment more than ten times.
"We do not believe in regulation through courts and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take the regulation on our activities and the powers that it gives us."
However, the opinion of the EPA noted that Pruitt could continue to exercise its powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers in order to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
The Republicans are conducting a broader change in the ozone provisions in the Congress.
The legislative initiative adopted last month aims at delaying the implementation of 2015 decisions for at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The general prosecutor of the state of New York, who brought the EPA into court this week, said Eric Schneiderman, that the group intends to continue the pressure.
"The change of the EPA’s minds as a result of our complaints is a significant profit for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and for over 115 million Americans exposed to the direct effects of the smoke trap in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia were involved.
Earth surface ozone occurs when emissions from cars, power plants, oil processing plants and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This can cause serious respiratory difficulties for vulnerable groups and is also part of thousands of premature deaths annually.
Public health promoters and environmental protectors rejoiced in Pruitti’s surprising change in direction.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required for the guy responsible for our breathing atmosphere to use sound sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the center of Biological Diversity.
"We must fight against Trump's administration, because its ideological objective is to act under the conditions of contaminants and other groups of their own interests."
The supercar manufacturer's becoming a street racket, "the Ferrari style is happening"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to keep its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it happens in Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said about the plans of the information meeting on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News news.
All cases of East Savo mast vaccines of the same virus type
Coastal occlusion is the same virus type as in the previous cases of East Savo, to be reported by THL.
The virology laboratory of the Institute of Health and Welfare has ensured that the fifth vaccination of East Savo is the same virus strain as previous infections.
The THL has ensured that the vaccination of ashtrays confirmed on Friday 28 July is the same virus type as the previous cases of East Savo.
On the basis of this information, all infections in East Savo are linked to the first vaccine found in June in the region.
The news is good, because it means that we have not shown any other types of mushroom vaccine.
However, it is possible that the fifth-year-old person may still have new penetrations until mid-August, and the epidemic is not yet over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, a doctor responsible for the infectious diseases of the basic health care of Soster.
No new ashtrays or suspicions have been revealed since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that each person ensures the up-to-date protection of his own vaccines, Erkkilä reminds us.
More on the subject: In Pirkanmaa, three new pest infections were confirmed - "Other infections or epidemics are very unlikely"
Finland prepares for a permit to make a squeeze
They didn't even think about the soup to be legalized.
Based on the basis of the fact that the process produces, alongside alcohol, methanol, which is toxic.
It's legal to make a pile at home next year, but it's not even considered to legalize the pony soup.
The shield is made on a walkway, and the squirrel is distilled again.
The basis for the regulation of distillation is that the process, alongside alcohol, produces methanol, which is toxic.
It has not shown the political will to regulate the soup for all men's rights, Mr Ismo Thomas from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared a reform of the alcohol law, the distillation of the ponny was not considered to be legalised.
It was also not brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, Mr Outi Mäkelä (Kok.) notes.
He is in the negotiating group of parliamentary groups, who took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
In the future, a permit for distillation at home can not even be granted on application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain authorised.
Importing tells us that a simple rule for the home making of alcoholic beverages is to be made by way of go home.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can now make lawfully scream at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law removes the requirements of flavouring and aromatic substances and enables the sparkling production of the Root to be specified.
The production must still be carried out so that the raw materials or flavouring substances resulting from their use are clearly detectable in the drinking process.
According to the new law, drinks should be prepared as much as you want, and self - making alcohol can be given as a gift.
It must still not be put on sale.
The work of Kiló is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Introducing believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol presentation is now being checked by the Ministry of Justice.
Alcoholism comes to the Parliament as soon as the September season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9 p.m.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It's like the Parliament has already taken a stand, and the mountain is happy.
Oscar Pistorius was sent to the hospital by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered chest pain, was admitted to a South African hospital for heart attacks.
Pistorius's already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is in prison in Atteridgeville.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison mediator confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for investigations.
The spokesman of the Pistorius family told me that the former top-sporter was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-fold paralympic gold militant for six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Literated telephone discussions reveal that Trump pressured Mexico to build a border wall
The litres of telephone discussions between President Donald Trump and the heads of Mexico and Australia have been leaked to Washington Post.
Trump called on President Enrique Peña Nieto, in a telephone discussion on 27 January 2017, to stop his public speech that he was not planning to pay the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called Nieto to the public that it had crushed the wall project. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall at the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published the literation of Trump's first call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on the way to Australia is "screaming", "dead" and "typer". Trump said that a contract negotiated during Obama would make him look like an "idiotic" because he had proposed a ban on the reside of refugees in the United States.
Trump stopped the call by saying to Turnbull, "This was the most unpleasant call all day."
Georgia's massacre: Activists re-introduced in the hope of the racist lynching justice
The Ford Mercury car passes a crowd in Monroe’s small town in Georgia's countryside and continues on its way to the small Moore's Ford bridge.
There's four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and four armed men block the road before they get to the bridge.
The leader of the crowd, the middle-aged man dressed in a stripe suit, takes a deep breath of his cigar and twists through the windscreen.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" man blows.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a re-exploitation presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the stings of shock are real when the hanging eye is stuck in the neck of the Roger.
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to re-introduce the events of 1946. At that time Ku Klux Klan lynnked two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with murders.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though murderers live among us and many must know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who will assist in re-entermination arrangements.
"It's a disgrace of history, but above all, it's a burden that weighs our soul."
Brooks is an 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia Congressman.
For him re-entry is a shocking invitation to action, and it also reminds Monroe's residents of the fact that the injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the perpetrators to be brought to justice, and we want things to be finally concluded, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but above all we want justice," says Brooks.
"We can't recover and reconciliate before we get justice."
The death investigation covers the body of the victim who died in Georgia's massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI documents received by NBC news, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
But no one was accused of murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, the activists believe that the motives of lynching have been all the time known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the black people of the state of Georgia had the highest right to vote for the first time in the presidential elections. The Supreme Court adopted its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident at the time of the election, where the black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently touched Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the city was rumored that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was waiting for it.
According to the FBI's information, Loy Harrison, a powerful white landowner, paid a $600 guarantee from Malcom, against which he was released from prison.
On their way home, they were with Malcom and Dorothy, their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and arranged murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities, and the authorities were involved in murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the Witnesses."
Brooks is more profound.
"It was a voter's murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to tell the black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing Georgia's massacre for almost a decade.
The performance is extremely realistic and imprisoned, and it is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe already in the United States of America.
It's hard to watch the show, but it's even harder not to see what Greene thinks it is.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we'd have to face our own dark sides," says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
On the first day, about 30 actors — a dozen blacks and 20 whites — gathered together to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is an assistant manager for Greene.
He has been presenting the head of the local Ku Klux Klan in the re-envelopment for years, but the role is always as difficult and disgusting.
"I'm gonna feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"It is important, however, that this side of history is also presented so that it will never happen again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona are practicing Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom yells and pushes Hester, and he's pissed off that Hester's had a relationship with Dorothy.
Didn't you hear me?
Rascona, or Hester, will answer.
Then we're going to hit.
And then all (at least all black actresses) will laugh.
Greene laughs harder.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene's going to shit.
"I just don't think the whites used the word n--u at that time."
"Yes," another black actor confirms it.
"It's a slange, you have to use a longer version."
The subject of the show is unpleasant, but the room's power is a friend's spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the show, but for respecting the memory of those who have died.
The scene starts from the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are shaking.
No one laughs.
Reproduction ends rapidly and violently.
Crying, shots — and silence.
A woman dressed for a black funeral stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holidayn Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks every other word.
A few ten metres away, fifty watchers wipe out sweat and tears in their eyes.
Almost half of the audience are black and half white.
There's a couple in the group who's come to watch a show from Ithaca, New York State, but most of them are local.
They have visited the victims' graves of Brooks in the moisture of Georgia.
Murder has become true from the story, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song show, Greene's calling a crowd to check the bodies.
Children are able to look at artificial blood and unmobilised bodies and whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutes like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actresses who were performing the lynches take off their hints and wipe the tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actresses and then breaks out with tears after a tough show.
"Don't worry," the woman in the show comforts me.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and the actors will meet for a dinner together.
A white couple from Altanta discusses the performance with the black couple she just met.
Denise Duplinski is also difficult to find words when he describes the feelings that are raised by the performance.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and to look at the terrible things they say and do, people who look like you - just because they look like you," he says.
"My performance made me realize that the lynches are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
Brooks, on the other side of the room, recalls the development of civil rights for audiences sitting on the same table.
He says he's already started planning the next year's performance.
"Recovery is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also a teaching experience," Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
Breeding crops in shops is burst: This is what it really saves by removing "extra parts"
Is it allowed to remove the flower cabbage leaves already in the store before we weigh?
And to take out the big hat out of the ananas, it weighs how much, right?
The answers give a strong share of opinions: to one, it is an expression of the extreme snare, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that are not used and which, however, go home to trash.
They'll identify the scene in the stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket of the Helsingle Gulf, for example, because many will rip off the leaf parts of the flower cabbage.
The leaves from the box are sold to biowaste.
According to the news published by the economic news, squirreling with vegetables is a miracle for traders.
But how much does the removal of extra parts of vegetables really save money before weighing?
How important is the method of sniffing really?
We women tested how the price changes when taking the leaves or stocks off the ananas, latva-artisoke, delicious mushrooms, broccoli and floral.
Flower cabbage: EUR 2.10 paid for the price of the flower cabbage amounted to EUR 1.80 when all the leaves were removed from it.
Ananas: the total price of an ananas paid by EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its position turned away.
The price of EUR 2.60 became 2.40 when the short-term stock was removed.
Delicious piglets: Two delicious pigs paid a total of 75 cents.
Without the boards, 60 cents came to the price.
Parsakal: A medium-sized parsakal paid 1 euro and without a bear of 80 cents.
Final result: If the leaves and stocks start to lick off, it saves a few tens of cents at best for one vegetables.
As a percentage, the cost of vegetables fell by up to 20%.
These purchases would therefore have saved a total of EUR 1.20!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - the Brazilian star signed a five-year agreement with the PSG
The Brazilianist Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, reports the news agency AFP.
On Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona in the Spanish league.
The sum of the transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the Manchester United had a record that cost EUR 105 million last summer for Paul Pogba, French.
Spain too slowed the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment company of Neymar’s representatives.
According to the rules of the League, the company who buys can not pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player himself must buy out his contract, which happens by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, the PSG has paid an amount to Neymar and its representatives who provided the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is supposed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
He may be presented to the new home audience in the opening of the PSG season against Amish on Saturday.
Uefa is investigating the details
In addition, Barcelona reported in its communication that it provided information on the payment to Uefa of the European Football Union so that it could determine the disciplinary measures that may result from the case.
Among other things, Javier Tebas, president of the Spanish league, has suspected that the PSG's use of money would break the rules of Uepha's economic fair game.
Uefa may be punished for a company that will make over EUR 30 million losses over a period of three years.
According to Uepha, Neymar's transfer does not automatically violate its economic rule.
Neymar’s transfer to PSG affects the company’s economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, the PSG may sell a number of players with significant sums, Ufaa was informed.
The PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatar Company Qatar Sports Investment.
The company is chaired by a former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaif, Qatari.
Ten shirts for Neymar
Austin, 21, we got a burner lightning hit on the airplane, a lightning flash recorded in my airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was making regular work arrangements for a plane at the international airport of South-Florida with a couple of workmates, suddenly hit the lightning from the rain of the sky to the plane.
The power of the Flash threw the plane into the land of Dunn near its wings.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had a third degree of fire all over his body.
My father called me and said he had an electric shock and he's in the hospital.
I just asked him if he was alive, says Austin's sister Autumn.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and brain bleed.
The experience was hard on the whole family.
There's no way to expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn tells me.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was in place at the time of the case and the transport industry itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and restores business dividend by cutting
The British Training Group Pearson announced that it would reduce 3 000 jobs on Friday and cut dividend by 72% in response to the new restructuring programme’s business pressures.
According to Managing Director John Fallon, job reductions are mainly made at the end of 2018 and early 2019.
Pearson announced that it would cut costs again by 300 million pounds in May as part of its third savings programme to revitalise business deteriorated as a result of rapid digitisation.

An attack on the contaminant in Kabul: A NATO soldier died in a suicide attack
A suicide bomber hit a military consignee in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul, according to the authorities, a NATO soldier was killed and several others were injured.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and a translator were injured.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians also died in the attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday 30 people were killed in a mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, two people died of a suicide bomber at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, the Thursday night explosion occurred when the Nato and Afghan Army patrol became targeted by the attack on the "person by means of an autonomous explosive device".
The opinion reported that all injured were stable and treated at the US Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the confirmation of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are important concerns for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% were killed in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, where mostly chiamuslims live.
Taliban reported himself behind the attack.
On the last day of May, in the centre of Kabul, more than 150 people died in a bombing attack that was the most devastating militant group attack in the country after the United States commanded forces attacked the Taliban in 2001.
Violence underlines the insecure situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and the police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul over the past few weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
The EPA is evacuating its decision to postpone the implementation of the provisions on smoke swabs
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decided to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce the emissions of smoke pollutants during Obama’s administration the day after 15 states had challenged the Agency’s law.
The EPA announced its decision on the late Wednesday implementation of the so-called ‘Ozone Determinations’ 2015, which, according to the Agency, shows its commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the States," said Director Scott Pruitt in the opinion of the Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year to October 2018. According to the definitions, the smoke-suspension rate is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with the stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the Agency sued 15 mainly by Democrats ruled state, including District of Columbia, that the postponement of implementation was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought ways to mitigate the environmental provisions of Barack Obama, which says the measures are part of a broader programme for economic growth.
The Trump measures have been opposed by the Democrats and environmental protectors, who are concerned about the effects of increasing emissions on health.
According to EPA websites, the air inhalation of ozone-containing air can "absorb lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as as as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person who was headed by Isis had also sent a bomb to Sydney.
According to suspects, the bomb was intended to be taken into a plane on July 15, but the company interrupted before the security inspection.
The police won't tell me exactly why the company broke down.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a device for the release of toxic colourless gas and to take the device to a spotful public place, such as a public transport device.
Michael Phelan, Federal Deputy Commissioner for Australia, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans that have ever been made in Australia.
Because of the terrorist plans of the suspects, four men were captured in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews will continue.
Liquid Managing Director: Renewable fuels worked well
The result of Nestee, the oil refiner, fell before taxes, but hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Managing Director Matti Lievosen, the company made a good result in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products increased to the record level and the marketing & Services segment's operating profits were in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profits improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievos, the operating profits of renewable products remained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and our growth projects, and we will be able to complete the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017, Lievonen said in the newsletter.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatchenko discuss the possible fight at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatchenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at a collision course for the most interesting boxing game in the near future of a series of less than 66.7 kilos, encountered each other on Thursday for the first time.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel offices in Los Angeles until the WBC's invincible lighthouse master Mikey Garcia walked along the hall to greet Lomašenko, WBO's superior feather master.
On Saturday, Garcia won on Showtime by the unanimous decision of the former four world champions Adrien Broner, and since then Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the five best of the different weight classes on a comparative list of boxers.
Garcia handed her right hand and asked, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck with the fight!"
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN channel at 7:00 a.m. on Saturday.
When the twin posed for photographers, the manager of Lomachenko Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between men would be "full for sizes".
"I'm a former feathery," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved a series above [63.5 pounds] for the Bronner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small size of 63.5 pounds.
I want to go back to the light show.
He's gotta get up to the lightshare [61.2 pounds], and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let us fulfill their wishes."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Nervous needs this fight."
Klimas asked whether the match should be organised on the pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomatchenko, according to which Lomachenko debytoi later this year and will fight against Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 winners). Garcia would also be interested to face the winner of the battle between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell are fighting in the light line in Forum on 23 September.
"The fight could be on the pay channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that she was ready to fight on a channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else is getting as much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we get a deal..."
Garcia said she appreciated Lomachenko as a "unfaithful fighter" and maybe she was going to go see the Saturday game.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's hill and said that this three-class champion from Riverside seemed like "too slow, sorry, Mike... but you needed that knock-out."
Garcia said that she was focused first on showing the force and then on boxing.
Men said they felt that the fight between them was to be more and stronger.
"This is the fight they're waiting for.
No other match is as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he was expecting to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Average salary 5 300 euros, education what happens - the situation of investment counselling was "wild and free"
The quality of investment counselling has been talking a lot lately.
Last told the Helsinki Sanomat about Ritva, 68, to whom the banking investor spoke about a full bunny when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisers and sales of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
They are based on the new Financial Market Directive, which will start to apply from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the skills of investment advisers and workers selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
No knowledge requirements are defined in the law.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service carry out its own APV1 or APV2 studies.
The financial sector has accredited the organisation of qualifications for an APV investment research firm called Oy, whose degree group is a member of the Financial Supervisory Board (Fiva), experts from universities and industry.
The studies have a range of 12-15 study points, and their tents are compiled by Aalto EE, the Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management development services.
Its website tells us that, in general, both tents are "very wide in terms of requirements".
The educational material includes 10-15 books and a number of other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Research Oy, reports that the percentage of progress is roughly estimated at about 70.
APV1 or APV2 have been carried out by most of the staff of the largest banks, as their performance is mandatory according to the corporate rules.
Then there are smaller banking movements without mentioning names whose staff seem to have mapped the performance of qualifications, Saviko says.
He said that these kinds of banking business are "change."
According to kaviko, the APV1 study has been conducted since 2000 by 13 000 to 14 000 persons and approximate APV2 qualifications recommended to investors.
Some banking movements consider the performance of the qualification to be an advantage.
In many other sectors there are much more knowledge requirements.
The proposal in the financial sector calls for the completion of APV degrees, as the investment sector's expertise will then be ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors averagely earn several thousand euros per month, including commissions, natural benefits and income premiums.
The average period of regular working hours for the monthly wages is approximately EUR 5 300.
The average monthly earnings for skilled men is over EUR 5 900 and women are over EUR 4 500 respectively.
On average, the ten of most earnings deserves about EUR 8 100.
The ten of most earning men deserves more than EUR 9 000 a month or more, a tenth of the most earnings earnings EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Service Act can only be provided by an authorised company.
Up to now, self-regulation has been reliant on the level of employees and tasks.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out was against individual cases where the expertise and qualifications of the investor were not sufficient on the basis of the conduct of the adviser.
Investment products can also be sold in principle even if professional skills and qualifications are at a hep level.
Basically, the situation has been wild and free in this respect.
Several other sectors have much more knowledge requirements, says Savikko.
According to kaviko, from the beginning of next year, there will be tightening of this by the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
This requires that each company is responsible for the staff providing investment services with sufficient expertise.
Financial control should be empowered to determine what needs to be done.
According to Fiva's market supervisor, Marko Hovi, one of the clear changes to the current situation is the legislation on the requirements for the knowledge and experience of investment advisers and investment products sellers.
According to the Court, the new requirements concern both the own staff of investment firms and related agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
According to the presentation of the Government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva should be empowered to determine knowledge and experience.
What they are precisely is decided with these visions during the autumn.
The company shall also continue to ensure the necessary training and, where appropriate, monitoring and further training.
All of this must be documented, and the company is obliged to demonstrate that this has been done.
The court states that, in practice, the company must, for example, map the activities of staff at individual level.
Depending on whether it comes to investment advice or to the sale of products, there will certainly be a number of requirements.
According to the Court, there is also a new requirement to work with someone more experienced during the deadline if the knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
So if the company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the specified criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, the rules will become more enlarged and concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be intensified at the beginning of 2018.

Imatra's stable coastal schools don't wait for rain or sun breeze - Iines Kaikkonen's polshardly with the help of a bathtub
Ianes, I've gotten a good move, Taina Itkonen followed.
The beach schools of Imatra are running on Liette and Lempuka this and next week.
Even though it rains and then shines again, young swimmers are not screwed up, Taina Itkonen, who is the leader of the swimming schools.
In swimming schools this week, a total of 13 children, next week a dozen.
The coming week’s number of children was affected by the fact that it begins school and escar, ittane estimates.
The project is combined with the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, the beach of Liettee had a nice atmosphere.
The sun shined and the young swim schools practiced to stay on the surface with swimming pools, someone even without.
The smaller sisters also enjoyed the water.
Iones of the Cake, 5 first thought the way deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged her to squeeze towards the beach.
You're doing great!
Ianes Kaikkonen told me he was in a lot of swimming this summer.
He's got a good bathtub.
In the way of Iines Kaikkus, the swimming village was closely trained, Vili Huhtainen, 5.
You too will be satisfied with the achievements of this day, the swim school praised.
Jami Kallio, four, once in a while, he wanted to go to the water wars.
Her daughter Anna Vilberg, 6 swims from the beach, Ilona Vilberg, considers the beach swimming school a good start for studying swimming.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna's liked to go here every day.
Sometimes we had to warm up.
Swimming schools added to the pier.
The boys had plenty of time with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkanen, 3 and Anna Vilberg spread to the pier towels, snatched fruits, and lit the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but there was no rush on the pier.
It's like that when it doesn't belong in summer.
With an unknown soldier, they sell toilet showers, "There's this kind of combining story."
You see a lot of things.
The cleaning product Blue product drew up a series of unknown military products a few days ago.
I mean dishwashers and washing sticks and "wc-brush" on the crossbrush.
An unidentified soldier refers to a movie that's getting his first night in the fall and the marketing of a movie.
Yet there is something special in the combination, and the products have been mocked in social media: When will Unknown health bonds come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is about.
What does Aino Määtta, Vice-President of Blue Product, say?
We're the partner of the movie.
We're supporting this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, says Määtta.
According to him, the products will be specialized in movements, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn't there something a little funny about this, often when you think that the products and the related stories would have something in common?
Yes, this is a similar combining story that we are a Finnish player and these are Finnish products, says Määtta.
According to him, his company supports the same Finnish basic values that are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown soldier.
And cleaning isn't a stranger to the military culture.
Other partners in the unknown military film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
For example, Hartwall's vichys have been introduced to the market so far, which are found by the names Rokka, Hietane and Koskela.
Unrecognised products have already been reckoned by Suomen Magazine Blogist Kalle Kinnunen
There are also coffee and watches available.
Kinnunen points out there's still time for the first night of the film, so there's still a chance to continue.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their military products, for example, Valio, Processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnune writes.
The new results of the Swedish age tests for asylum seekers were published
The latest results of Sweden's medical age tests for asylum seekers have been published. The results of the tests carried out in the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years old, but not all of them are reliable.
The Swedish National Medicines Agency started testing earlier this year.
The tests can assess the age of the asylum seeker more closely than before. A new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for its failure to determine the actual age of applicants claiming to be minor.
To date, the Finnish Immigration Agency has carried out 6 880 tests, and the Agency has now published the results of 2 481 tests.
80% of the subjects tested, i.e. 2002, were identified as over 18 years of age, and 25 cases were identified by the Judicial Institute that the test was "possibly 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, the result was that the asylum seeker is "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests were only performed in cases where there were grounds for suspicion of the age reported by the applicant.
Johan Göransson of the Judicial Institute reports that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent. There are large differences in statistics from previous months," he told The Local.
Although most of the applicants were identified to be over 18 years old, this does not necessarily mean that applicants had been lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and announced that 442 cases had "references that the study was 18 years old or older".
When Svenska Dagblade examined the same results, it was apparent that in 243 cases the applicant was openly informed that he would complete this year for 18 years.
The medical method used for testing the age assessment takes X-rays of the wisdom tooth and the magnetic image of the knee joint, and then dental doctors and radiologs analyse the images.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinen Institute, whose work is part of an assessment of human biological maturity.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't definitely determine the age, we should not pretend we can do it," he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Judicial Institute, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of determining the child as an adult is small.
The risk is the greatest in a situation where you will soon be tested for 18 years, and then the risk will be about 10%."
Ilonen collapsed 30 locations in Scotland
Five over par results in the third round spent a 30-point score of Mikko Ilose on the downward golf tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left on a place divided by Saturday 11th, but at the end of the round, they found a position of 41.
There was a double bog in the troubled skulls of three bogs.
The rest of them had a hard time too.
Ian Poulter, England, rose up to share the top place in one under par, even though he told me that there was enough work in the length of the parachute.
The side was rough, but I hanged along and finally was a good day, Poulter's mind.
He's sharing the headline with his landlord Callum Shinkwin and the Australian Andrew Dodd.
The Governor of Western Virginia is changing the party
Jim Justice, Democratic Governor of Western Virginia, announced on Thursday night at Trump's campaign event that he would change the party.
"Democrates simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you, after many prayers and thorough considerations, today I will tell the Western Virginias that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience broke out of horrific applause.
"To be a member of the Republican Party registered in the morning," Justice added.
"As coach, I'd say it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised that a significant announcement would be made at the Western Virginia campaign.
Trump won in West Virginia at 42 points because Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. Forbes says he's the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited his father's mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
The value of his assets is about $1,59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republics (RNC) published the opinion that "the political exchange of Governor Justice is another strike for a democratic party that is more likely to build obstacles than better America."
"Democrates have only 15 governors and less states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the most recent assault on a party with no kind of leadership and is unable to find a positive, human-integrating message," said RNC representative Ronna McDaniel in his statement to the CBS news.
The lightning sown damage from Thursday comes even the very thunderday of the summer
From the end of the week, more thunders are also obtained in Southern Finland.
During the past week, there has been thundering, especially in the middle and northern parts of the country and in the area of Warsaw.
In the night between the middle week and Thursday, lightning attacks lit many fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may be a very thunderous day of the summer.
The dwarfs have finally found Finland too.
During the past week, there has been lightning, especially in the middle and northern parts of the country and in the area of Varsinais-Finland.
At the table, the lightning hit the line house's electrical center, causing a small fire.
The rescue facility received an announcement of the fire at about 15 minutes until midnight on Wednesday.
The electric center was located in the sauna room at the end of the line house.
The rescue plant unloaded the roof and wall to find fire bursts and blew off the fire.
Eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal damage was avoided.
On the hill, the lightning set off the outer building in Harjulanti before midnight.
When the rescue facility arrived, the building was already at the full fire stage, and the rescue facility could not be more than to prevent the spread of the fire.
A building of about 50 square feet [50 m] wide burned down.
In the direction of the Kuopion, the lightning hit the home house again.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a magnificent lightning attack.
The rescue facility went down to check the case, but this time, the lightning didn't get a fire, just a few of the fences exploded.
In traffic, the thunder caused problems on the train track between the Wall River and the Vaasa when lightning damaged the system of traffic control.
Information on the defect was received on Thursday morning between 8 and 9 a.m., after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem could only be corrected a little before five afternoons.
Since then, the train traffic has been able to continue normally also by the thundering part of the train.
The lightnings have sown the destruction across Finland.
But the lightning has been very small this summer.
These thunderings of this summer have been so deadly! estimates the meteorologist Jari Tuvinen, a meteorologist of the Air Science Facility.
On the middle of the week and on Thursday, the thunderstorms have mostly been moderate in their strength, but because of the small lightning salt of the summer, they seem to be even powerful.
This may seem like a very stubborn thunder, but that's what it has been, compared to the thunders of this summer, Thomas says.
On Wednesday, the terrain rabbed 1,700 times, and on Thursday, it has had potential even to the hardest day of the summer: around 16 p.m., the poster had 1,790 landscapes.
If the lightning continues to continue on the beginning of the evening, then you can get to over two thousand lightnings, Thomas predicts.
The previous record of the thunder year was experienced in 2015, when the year’s lightning rate was about 30 000 copies.
By Wednesday, the lightning rate of this year had risen to 18 386 lightning.
So there is still something to be attached to so that this year does not break the "record" of two years ago.
However, the blind skir may expect to continue.
According to the present, Finland will also remain warm and moist in the end of the week, which is an acceptable birth environment for thunders.
The main weight of the dwarfs is likely to be moving on Saturday from the northern parts of the country to the south, where some 2,000 lightning days can be obtained on Saturday and Sunday.
In the middle parts of the earth, there is a more uniform rainfall.
That's the kind of thing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Coe praises Russia's "offensive" apology for doping scandal
The World General Sports Boss Sebastian Coe praised the openly described apology made by Russia on Thursday due to the doping scandal, but Coe added that it was not time to stop the Russian ban.
The Russian general sports director Dmitri Shljathin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday, the World War on the World War on Thursday, that the Russian ban is appropriate and he intends to fight strongly against doping.
He said that he was sorry for the "all the athletes that were taken from the competitions of gold or silver medal".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the continuation of the ban. Russia was excluded from the general sports competitions in November 2015 after evidence of the state-funded doping in Russia was presented in the WADA report.
"I believe that his response today was very straightforward; it was a very open presentation," IAAF President Coe told the journalists.
"The whole Council and the Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian Alliance for Alliance for Sports admitted that the country had been through difficult times and announced that they would do everything they could to reorganise their activities."
Mr Coe also said that he was "become" that Russia accepted the conditions for the decision to terminate the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress, but the Congress supports the group's recommendation that it is not the time to stop the Russian ban," Coe said.
"We must do everything we can to normalise the situation in the coming months.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes are competing at the neutral athletes in London at the global sports World Competitions on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of IAAF.
On Monday, the Head of the IAAF Working Group, Mr Andersen, said that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before it can be restored.
"The test is still insufficient, and the coaches who have been banned continue to act freely," he told the IAAF Council on Friday after his presentation in London.
The production company disappointed the weak success of the Tom of Finland film
The Tom of Finland film did not become as successful as the authors wanted, says Yle.
If honestly said, I am disappointed, acknowledge that the film was produced by the Helsinki Film CEO of Annika Sucksdorff Yle's interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems it is.
The film was first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had sought a fair 100 000 viewers, which is about five million euros in the film budget, compared with little.
This was not a lotto win, but now it's important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been better in the country, they'd already have their money.
Now we have to wait for little bites of foreign distribution, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film driven by Dome Karukokske.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The rules restricting the use of European football clubs do not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Spain from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, France, which is the most expensive player transfer ever in the world.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by the European football regulator UEFA, which can prevent the participation of teams in the renowned Master League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the financial rules for a fair game, according to which the PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar’s transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million for the closure of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's annual salary in the new company moves to tens of millions of dollars.
Neymar's transfer to France is linked to a variety of economic aspects.
The PSG has no difficulty in paying the amount of Neymar's transfer and attaching him to its astronomer card, as it will finance the ruler family rich with Qatar's oil.
The clubs are allowed to use large sums for the purchase of players, but they must be balanced with actual sources of income so that football business is not loss-making.
The financial rules for fair game were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platin, who was elected to chair UEFA in 2007.
As a former football player, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by making debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners pulled their support.
In 2011, the priority of fair game economic rules was shifted from clubs' liabilities to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the first business model used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly difficult to implement. Abramovich bought a promising team, used huge sums for player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year assessment period of fair game economic rules will last until 2018. During this period, the clubs will be allowed to make up to EUR 30 million losses.
Although Platini had to leave the functions of UEFA president scandalically in 2015, his successor, Alexander Cefer, also wishes to control the reckless spending of the clubs.
"The rules of fair game are still in use, and we will also apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, responsible for the fair game's financial rules in UEFA, told the Associated Press News Office last week.
Although the PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a single compensation, it may distribute the amount in the accounting of his new contract for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual cost of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
On the basis of fair game's economic rules, the first sanctions were allocated in 2014 to the PSG and the Manchester City funded by Abu Dhabi.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the company was ordered to limit its group of champions to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
The UEFA will monitor the euros that may try to circumvent its financial rules by increasing their income through companies associated with company owners.
If, for example, the qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA does not calculate the aid as the actual result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatar Tourism Authority for PSG was overweight.
It has also been shown that a part of Neymar’s earnings in the PSG could be funded by payments made available by Qatar from the MM Competition Committee for football in 2022.
However, the PSG and the Arrangement Commission have denied that Neymar would be made by the Embassy of the MM competitions, which would be very easy to reveal such a arrangement.
Due to the past sanctions of PSG, the UEFA will follow even more closely the rules on companies.
On Thursday, the sources of the situation reported that the UEFA has not negotiated with PSG on Neymar's transfer.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press News Office on condition that their identity is not revealed because they have no powers to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the latest published accounts, the net sales of PSG during the period 2015-2016 amounted to EUR 542,4 million and operating profits above EUR 10 million.
The last season's financial statements have not yet been published.
The PSG expects Neymar to be attracted to new sponsors and to increase sales of the following products and toys.
The Society estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent with the Neymar Agreement.
Spain was clearly upset by the departure of the best player in the world, too, trying to make it difficult for Neymar to move. It was alleged to break the financial rules of the fair game.
"This is a clear economic doping case, both for society and for the state," said Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish league, to the Spanish AS newspaper, and he referred to the qatarian ownership of the PSG.
Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger also reserves the state's funding for the activities of the football club. Arsenal owns the American sports club.
"The outcome is the result of ownership, which has changed the operating environment of football in the last 15 years", says Wenger on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with fair game's economic rules. There are so many kinds of interests that relate to the fact that the famous player represents the state."
Now it's urgent: In Finland's world sports coach stuck in Helsinki
Arttu Pajulahti and triangle coach Kristiina Mäkelä Coach Suren Ghazarya is stuck in Helsinki, even though she should train general sports at the MM races in London.
As Christian Mäkele may have to compete without the advice of his coach.
The Pajulahti competes tomorrow in a long-distance hop and on Saturday, in a triple-drie-square evacuation.
However, the Twin Coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa for Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this without the results of the British embassy.
The coach has an invitation from the MM race organisers as a document, but it has not been suitable for obtaining a visa.
Wonder if this is the first of Brexit’s symptoms, or what, coachman Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always handled visa matters successfully, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Association SUL for years.
It doesn't mean so much.
As long as someone at the stadium looks at the step marks, Arttu Pajulahti said that his coach would be gone.
The MM medal of Finland in London requires a miracle
The MM competitions of general sport start in London today Friday and last at the end of a fair week on Sunday 13 August.
The species of general sport, terrain, and hockey are the species that Finnish banking athletes can passionately view from year to year, whether they have success or not.
In the hearts of bench sportsmen, success is measured in medals.
Of course there are other instruments.
Less attention is given to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from valuable races to another, where experience is gaining the performance of an athlete to the level that the MM medal of adults is truly possible.
Now there are no such young sportsmen and, however, no cocaines in Finland's small MM team.
The MM medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the fascination and surprise of sports is that wonders can happen.
It draws banking sports around the television screen and glue to follow the races, even though London’s medals are solved because of the time difference at night.
In 2015 Finland received one of the previous MM races in general sports bronsimitol.
It was brought by the spear thrower, Tero Langmäki.
The dazzles are waiting for a long medal even now, even though one tells the results of his and other throwers in recent times and the fallout of the Long Lakes in the value races of last summer.
In any case, Lääämäki stays in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
Access to the final competition for other Finnish sportsmen or to make their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and believe in the realistic medaly of Finland’s general sports in the coming years will give a good success in the international value races of young people this summer.
The processing of young talents and the financial support of its work is more important than maintaining a small group of representative sports elites.
Success will not come shortly, but it will require years of sweaty work from athletes and patience both for training and for bench sportsmen.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, London’s races will remain in history as the races of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of the fears of terrorism or the poor attacks.

It feels good and it's good, but I'm sorry that the last jump didn't go all right.
From now on, I'm going to try it again on the races, the Sea of the Ruka.
In the snowboarding Big Air, the competitor jumps from a hyppyr made for the species.
Viking Linen's new fast-ship hit the port in Helsinki
Viking's new high-speed ship, FSTR, is very late for the schedule.
The high-speed ship had to leave Helsinki at 6:00 p.m. to Tallinn.
The ship was loaded in eight countries.
The ship's already late for Helsinki.
At least an hour and a half, I've been waiting for you to get to the ship.
Now the car line moves a bit, John Rebane, a Estonian who awaits access to the ship at the Helsinki port, told us at 19.30 p.m.
The fox thought that the new ship had a technical fault.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought water bottles waiting for access to the ship in its cars.
The Viking Communication Manager, Christa Grönlund, says to the I.S., that there was a technical fault.
It was repaired at the Helsinki port.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship is too late for a couple of hours from returning to Tallinn.
The ship had to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.
A 42-metre special transport interferes with traffic on the Sixth Thursday night
42 metres of special transport from Moomo to the Port of Mustola during Thursday night.
Shipping from nine should arrive by 11 o'clock in the morning.
The police are running traffic on the Sixth, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
Traffic from the side of the pelvis is moving on 13 routes to the Port of Mustola.
Small district nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story shines both the days of the 80s and the grunge of the 90s (since David Wain and Michael Showalter made a glorious "The State" series for MTV) and its own time – 2001 – before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series switched to bigger things in their career.
As a cultural product, it is both a barode and a description of the continuous memorial to which we are bound during the Facebook period.
As a commercial product, it seems to have been alive.
First Day of Camp was surprisingly good, and not just because of his absurd humor (including the background of H. Jon Benjamin’s speech).
The essence of the joke is that middle-aged actresses are playing lustful teenagers approaching the age of full-time, which makes it a part of the inability to pursue the past.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotionally-based, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodises, for example, stalker movies from the '90s, such as a horror image of the Hand that is ringing.
On one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline skates and "move stuff from 1991".
A lot of stories are the same as before.
Goodhearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has still not been over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And a crazy plot includes Ronald Reagan (such as Michael Showalter) as a criminal partner, George H. W. Bush (who plays Michael Ian Black).
Like always in these series, the best is sidewalks.
It's especially fun to see the young Paul Rudd, who has a barbitupsu under the lower lips, or Matt Dillon's "soul batch" film in Singles. Rudd playd by Andy, camp's shoes, starting to be an old man.
The moments of accidental insanity may trigger this series as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Tweenty Years Later. In its last scene, a group of friends will go from the first night of the Wet Hot American Summer film.
The Amazon Comrade Detective series again appeals to the other kind of nostalgia: The Americans Series of Cold War, the Atomic Blonde film and even the GLOW series, where the east meets the West.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and led by Rhys Thomas. It is made Romanian police drama in the 1980s, where Bucharest cops fight for truth, atheism and marxism-lenism.
The majority of the hard-faced Gregorina and the idealist Iosefina are seen as Florin Piersic Jr and Cornelius Ulici. They have doubled in English Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (polices spend time watching TV chess the same way Americans view football).
There are a number of famous speakers, including Jenny Slate, Nick Oferman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
Comrade Detective, however, is too trapped in the simulation of the socialist drama of the clumsy – such as the murderer hiding behind the Reagan mask. Therefore, the series is often starting to feel like a clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough and not overwhelming.
A tightened series might work better as a agitprop satire, even when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. embassy and the lobby are always two fat men in hamburgers.
The message to the imaginated Communist audience is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: as a tour of our own close history and their history.
The Kouvolan Toni Taurus rises into the circle in Macau on Saturday, against the former UFC player.
Toni Taurus wants to keep the fight up.
In Macau, Toni Taurus gets a hard bone, because last year, the Brazilian Leandro Issa was still fighting in the UFC organization.
The Brazilian has also a jujut’s black belt and a world championship of the species.
One day, I'm gonna fight my parents.
That's funny. The 32-year-old Taurus tells me.
The Kouvolan was supposed to get into the ring last Saturday in Indonesia.
The fight was canceled because of logistical problems, but three struggles were made in a quick schedule for China's autonomous region in Macao.
Taurus has never met before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It irritated me because it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
However, the fighter is pleased that there was a new time for the struggle.
The waiting of the week has little effect on preparing.
The transfer doesn't work, because it doesn't get better a week.
It can get worse if you practice too much now.
In the last few struggles, Taurus has encountered opponents whose strengths are in the marching process.
This time, the situation is different.
Issa is described as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I'm guessing he'll come on hard in the first round and try to take me to the mat.
He's won the jujude world championship, so he can wrestle.
The previous match of the Kouvolan didn't go as planned.
The Philippines Kevin Belingon hit Taurus badly in the eye, and the Philippines had a victory.
I've never had a fight so much, especially on the top: he's never been hit.
When I left to pour, he hit my eye angle.
It was a very long time ago.
New motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some rise in the ring more often.
For example, the future opponent Issa fought the last time in September.
The Taurus had three fights last year.
The second struggle of the current year is now ahead.
Sometimes the pace has become pregnant.
I've been training in the last few years, and I've been in good condition all the time.
But I've only fought for fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the future meeting, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was training in Espoo, and I got the joy of doing it back.
We got really good training when a guy from Sweden was involved.
Practice was a great help, for on Saturday the Koulian has to prepare for physical struggles.
I've been able to train against the same size of opponents and practice the opera fight.
You know, fighting up is the main act of 32-year-olds.
I have to hit you rationally.
If there's a chance, I'll go to the property myself.
Lower exports should not be given free of charge because they consume most.
Macao's attracted to a Taurus fight in China before.
He said it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, great evening ahead of you.
The Bank of England maintains interest at 0.25%.
The Bank of England is expected to report that it maintains interest rates when economic growth has been paceless and the slowdown of inflation has stopped speculations from interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth would continue slowly, and the Bank transferred interest rates due to the increased pressure on family income.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided to hold interest at 0.25%. In this month, the interest rate received even less support because economic growth has been unthinkable.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank dropped its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%, and also warned that there would be more pressure on household income, as inflation is expected to continue to rise by almost 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rates are needed in the coming years to reduce the inflation rate that Brex has been accelerated, and the Bank also reported that the cost of the loan may need to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package, which was started a year ago in the post-decision of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide cheap funding to banks by means of the programme, more than 15 million pounds, i.e. a total of 115 million.
The Protocol on the Bank interest rate decision states: "The slow development of GDP is forecast by the Committee responsible for money policy in the coming years, as the real income decreases in households reduces consumption."
As regards interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for "increasing some degrees of money policy" market expectations to curb inflation.
The market currently predicts the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that the possible increases were "assettled" and "limited".
In May, the bank predicted an increase of 1.9% for this year and an increase of 1.7% for next year.
It now maintained its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The punta weakened in relation to the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the weight fell by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31, which decreased by 0.4 per cent compared to the euro and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to maintain interest rates was taken as a result of the weaker growth rates expected weakening the increased expectations of interest rates, with an increase of 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects the growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but a little rising at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation report gave little hope to households suffering from accelerating inflation and poor wage increases, and the Bank believes that the situation will worsen even before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "can't prevent" the decline in income in the coming years, but it expects that wage developments will be "significant" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong increase in the demand for British products as a result of a weak pound, which will repeal some of the effects of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the rate was calculated to 0.25 per cent of the shocked outcome of the EU referendum, which put the pound down.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be seen in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Before the latest decision of the Central Bank, interest rates had started to be demanded more and more louder, as inflation tightened the pressure on households, and three decision-makers demanded a interest rate of 0.5% in July.
In the last month, inflation slowed to 2.6% of 2.9% of June, but according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation is again intensified in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the crossing of its target of 2% was due to the weak pound.
"In view of the recent drop in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market would seem to increase further when creditors are looking for hot customers and want to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"Markkins look particularly good for those who have ended the current loan agreement; they are increasingly popular, their interest rates are low and there are also cost-effective alternatives."
NHS sets up 10 000 controversial HIV medicines
As of September, patients may be assigned a "reverse" anti-HIV drug. The highest law concluded a dispute on the financing of the medicinal product in the UK public health system (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10 000 people during the first three-year trial.
NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the court of the Supreme Court held the judgment of the last year, which states that NHS would be able to pay the PrEP, even though it claims that it should be financed by the local authorities.
The head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, called the decision declared on Thursday as a "significant new intervention", and the national AIDS organisation described it as "a critical moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will begin first to receive registrations for a experiment that will expand in October to other clinics. The experiment will reach its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention therapy (PrEP) should be taken prior to intercourse with HIV, which reduces the risk of infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV in risk groups.
Before intercourse, the medicine that you take means that you have enough drugs in your body during the intercourse that prevent HIV infection.
You can take the medicine daily or two hours before sex.
The target group includes gay men, bisexual men and trans-sex and people with HIV-positive partner who are not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics choose the conditions for the experiment to meet the conditions for male, female and trans-sex and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral therapy for its disease.
People who live in England and have registered general medical care can also apply for a trial in their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs 10 million pounds, and the UK NHS signed this week a contract for medicinal products after the international invitation to tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and the implementation of treatment.
"This important new intervention should complement and enhance the diversified and more effective ways already exist to prevent HIV," says Stevens.
"That is another significant achievement in the battle of over 30 years to solve the greatest health challenge of mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, Head of the National AIDS Organisation.
"If PREP is properly targeted to those who need it and belong to the risk groups, it may have a reversal effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, the risk group will receive a drug funded by the NHS, which they will be able to use independently without the need to negotiate with the partner, which will have an effective impact that will have to improve the lives of a large number of people.
This was a welcome news.
"Now it is most important to ensure that experiments are launched quickly throughout the country and no one in the risk group will be excluded," says Ian Green, Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP medicine used in the experiment has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people in risk groups from HIV infection."
"The beginning of the PREP experiment is a welcome event that has been overdue for several months because of the slowness of the government," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the Shadow Government.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a reversal effect on our work that we are doing to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
Experience will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get another step closer to the situation in which the spread of HIV in society has been able to stop."
Quality of living: Interior and smart decoration solutions have made a spacious home from Earl's Court's apartment
The former banker Joanne Leigh, who was enthusiastic in the renovation of real estates, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The house is on the first floor of the house of Queen Anna's time, and the success of the renovation tells us that Joanne has not yet packed her camps and moved.
"I used to live with my ex in a much bigger apartment in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price class.
I went to the apartment show and noticed that the rooms were as high as my apartment that night.
I was in love right away, and I made an offer on the same day."
Since then, about 90 square apartments have experienced a complete change in shape.
It was a twin where the bedroom only got into the kitchen, and Joanne wanted more storage space and a space to make use of the room height.
"I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands," he says.
He hired a job from the Duck & Shed design agency in Erfan Azadin Notting Hill. Erfan was assigned to exploit the room space of almost four metres high and to create a dwelling that would not just be a place of repair and sale but a home.
The room height was not enough for two double spaces, so the challenge was to build a interior where it could stand.
The solution required a creative thinking from Erfan.
"The rigid structures are kind of complicated.
The premises had to be duplicated in such a way that they did not need to be clawed.
The structures had to be transformed so that the height was just suitable on and below them."
Erfan was able to invest in the space in duplication of two full-high rooms with fascinating details.
The middle floor opens the copper-crossed window of Retrouvius to the stylish place of residence.
The mirrored furniture, silver power and the vintage lights of Serge Mouille create a distinct style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, the sense of the state and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor allow the corridor to look further.
A mirror in the space of the kitchen is like a window that opens a view to another room.
Indoor mirrored furniture has a storage space for Joanne’s meals and glassware.
More stylishness is that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
Kitchens equipped with skill doors are not a new solution,
But in Joanne's kitchen, the unique thing is that the door is lifted up the same way as the garage door.
"It demanded a little design," Erfan says about the steel-strong MDF door.
"It's balanced, which means it slips very easily when it lifts up."
Due to the sound use of the space and the design of the storage space, Joanne received 16 extra squares, another bedroom and a better basic solution.
"When you sell the place, the area will solve – or the value of the property," Erfan says.
"In the event, the real estate broker walks into the apartment and lowers the price based on the surface area."
In Joanne’s apartment, the area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the farm.
"The person is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional link to the dwelling is partly created on the basis of them," Erfan says.
"No one touches the electrical cables on the walls.
They're important, too, but not in the same way."
Joanne’s apartment is an example that good design and supplementary features can make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
There may also be such a possibility that no longer wants to move out of the apartment.
The Pregnant Princess Sofia radiated in her summer lounge
Princess Sofia's costume choice hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before she was born.
For sustainable Tomorrow dinner, the princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sofia represented the occasion with a smile.
The Swedish Princess Sofia has visited Sweden in Båstad this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a beautiful blue body apparel, which was wonderfully dressed at last as a pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue settlement.
This is the last mission in which Sofia represents before his birth.
His time counted is in September.
Sofia had picked up a beautiful pastel blue dress for dinner, which landed wonderfully.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastellinish dressed a fine princess.
Sofia has been on a mission trip to the Swedish Båstad this week.
Sofia fills her living with a little bag.
Sofia was actually irradiating in her delicate summer voyage.
Sofia was inclined to even talk to photographers at the event.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said laughing and referring to her end of trouble.
He grows us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, there appeared at the Lahti market, where Thai food was sold.
They were afraid not to taste it, they walked by.
At home, the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among the familiars of Panja.
He did not know much Finnish, and the Finns did not yet know Thai at that time.
Because the people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastes.
That's how he taught the salads to eat Thai food, and to snack at a time.
Try some, he said.
I got caught from the valley.
I went more and more and more, finally, every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai food area at the Lahde Chamber of Commerce.
There were two small tables, and I think there were fewer than 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food but also to sit next to the stranger.
When you are hungry and are restricted, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
In a little while, we got to know each other, and we became friends.
Finally, I sat at the plate with a dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went to the commercial hall, but then the restaurant had to change because the spices made themselves were said to be too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the end of the mall.
There's room.
Now, we prospers are allowed to sit on our own tables again, only in the most busy times, we have to be shy to ask the guests if there is room next door.
The bank knows her client.
He'll be told what he belongs to, where he's been and who he's seen.
He knows what food each one eats.
He's seen how customers' life stages vary and the food society changes.
He remembers what I went to eat with a man named my first cherry.
He remembers me as thin and fat, and remembers what I was when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than others, to sit at my place next to the kitchen door, and change the belongings with the Pan who leans on the dishes.
Food is not the most important thing he can get.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our taste, he has opened our minds and hearts.
Today, many people speak to him Thai... thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's been having a hard time, he's always been kind.
He's a hard man.
He goes to the restaurant work in the mushroom and the blueberry.
Last week at the restaurant was celebrating the trouble of two decades.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this remarkable day went by work.
The discovery of the underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists willing to attack in Europe
From the beginning of the year, security authorities received an important list of anti-terrorism work.
The list contains more than 170 Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt, there are 173 persons in total and the document also contains images of each individual, not only of their personal data.
Of the people mentioned in the list, more than 130 are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also involved.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Afternoon-words told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now, the location of the list and the information contained there have been improved.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi army Special Forces found a list of terrorists' personal data and images in search of the underground base of the terrorist organization in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities evaluated the authenticity of the papers and sent them forward to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The background was the fear that something big and serious would be planned in Western countries by terrorists after Isisi fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, not only the names and images of all persons, but also the date of birth, the subsidiaries invented, and information about the country of the person's home.
The list also identifies the specialities of terrorists.
For example, Sami J., a 27-year-old German on the list, says the war name Abu Assid al-Almani, or German.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later through Turkey to join the Isisi rows.
There's a suicide bomber written next to his picture.
There's no more accurate information on the man's destiny.
There have been some 6 000 fighters in Isisi's rows from Europe, whose destiny is unconfirmed.
The man fell underneath the surface in Tokoin, Helsinki
On the basis of the rescue interviews, the man wanted to show him how to swim.
A freak can save a drowning life, too.
On Thursday, a person underwater was rescued in the Tokoinrain of Helsinki.
According to Ville Estlander, the firefighter of the Helsinki rescue facility, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under water for about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The rescue diving found him underneath the surface, says Estlander.
The rescue facility received an announcement after half four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the first treatment.
Estlander says it was a man about 50 years old.
The interviews made him want to show you how to swim.
The situation in Tokoinra is over.
Estlander congratulates the cooperation of the authorities with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
The local residents also gave excellent guidance to divings.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars crashed in the Eura cars with nine people, three seriously injured.
There were nine people in the cars, and the rest of them had milder injury, says the Oxera fireman.
Among the injured are men and women.
The accident occurred at the crossing of three roads at four o’clock.
The crash happened when another car turned to three of the warns behind the other car, says the warrior.
According to the rescue facility, there is a limit of 80 kilometres per hour in the crossing area.
Brothers fight for more than $500 million property.
Two of the brothers are arguing about Victoria's largest real estate empire, worth over $500 million, which is related to their Italian family 40 years ago to a family business.
The former president of the Carlton football club and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Torak value area only three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the highest court to dispute the distribution of property and business property between brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but a bitter dispute is being held about the divorce.
The brothers and their mother, Anna, together own 38 properties with a value of more than half a billion dollars. The family began to collect assets when they bought a trade on the Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans store that extended 160 movements into a chain.
The trade chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, property building areas in Brunswick and Sorrento and apartments in Gold Coast and in Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in pre-town areas.
According to the agreement with the father of the family, Colin owns about two thirds of the company and Paul about a third of its assets. Paul describes his father as "the strong and central body of the family".
According to legal documents, the relationship between property and property means that Colin owns real estates about $316 million and Paul's worth of about $176 million.
Paul's not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin's proposal left the best properties for himself," Paul wrote in his first jury certificate in 2015.
Last Friday, the case was dealt with for the first time in the Supreme Court after several conciliation companies.
The brothers are also arguing about who controls the existing business, Paul claims that Colin has shut him out of business.
Colin says that the claim is not true, but that he blames Paul for the bad management of some real estates.
Colin, together, writes from his first illusions that he would like to get a solution.
"In line with our Italian traditions, the family is my priority," said Colin in his statement.
There are hundreds of pages of informal statements, e-mails and reports. The case is being examined by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her deceased husband, Luigi, were Italian migrants who set up milk bars and delicious shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a trade in Brunswick.
They were used as a guarantee to buy a family from Collingwood a property where Colin founded the family’s first jeans store.
Colin says that he founded a trade "in the last few years of the class, when Paul was still a child (approximately 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the property to their boys in harmony.
"Luigi often said that he didn't want the brothers to end up in court," she writes in her statement.
The two other boys in the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group business.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are a "cross the financial conditions of their departure".
Colin has kept a low profile, even though he is a former member of the Australian League of Football and the best friend of the TV star Eddie McGuire, according to this biography published in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Col and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin only answered, and in his SMS, he said that it was not right to comment, because it was dealt with in court.
"It's very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw me into a court of law, according to the name of our family," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept his brother’s claims.
"Our father would not have wanted us to fight this way," Colin continued and said that he would continue to hope that a solution would be reached.
On Friday, the hope seemed to have fallen out.
Colin wrote, "We'll be settled in court in the near future."
The new Chief of Staff of Trump intends to limit the media use of the President.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to the Poltico magazine, the new Head of Staff of the White House intends to limit the use of President Trump's media and the monitoring of news so that the boss does not get into so many troubles.
Reported by editor Josh Dawsey:
"When the new Head of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with the management staff on the first day of his work, he took the floor on the main problem he intends to solve: he intends to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told the workers of the White House that all the information – both printed and consulted at the information conferences – must be carried through him because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit the use of Trump's media and failed.
President Trump has a decade's relationship with television, and as President, he continues to watch a lot of television.
"If the presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news, he was encouraged to show that sympathetic media handled things more equitable," said Sam Nunberg, who worked as a consultant in the Trump campaign, to the Politico magazine in February.
The policy editor, Tara Palmeri, wrote at that time that, according to the six former campaign workers, "it is essential to control the use of Trump Twitter that his personal media flow is a constant flow of praises.
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that the use of Trump Twitter would never have been controlled.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something we do not know — perhaps the twitters of Trump would have been even worse without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump left behind.
If his staff has been able to stop him from causing problems at least a few times, their work has not been for nothing.
However, no one has been consistently able to prevent the wrath caused by Trumps.
The problem is partly because there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to drive their case by giving Trump information that supports their view — that information can be reliable — or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers intentionally provide the President with questioning information.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
"The current and former workers of Trumpin say that he can get so mad at press plays where he is judged, especially if it tells of harmful information leaks, and then he must know where the information comes from.
This was the case in late February when someone viciously gave the president a copy of the GotNews.com website set up by Promotion Charles C. Johnson, where Katie Walsh, Deputy Chief of Staff, was accused of several of the information leaks of the White House.
Johnson was permanently removed from Twitter because of harassment, and he had previously disseminated false accusations and later withdrawn them. He also did not provide concrete evidence.
Despite that, Trump had started the case after reading the staff about Walsh."
Mr Goldmacher added that the staff chief of that time, Reince Priebus, and Mr Rob Porter, the White House's staff secretary, had tried to introduce a system for the management of documents to Trump.
And what was the result?
Kelly's gonna try the same three months later.
Maybe he'll prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still their own impulsive self and his assistants continue to drive their own affairs.
These unchangeable facts make Kelly very difficult.
Neymar concluded a five-year agreement with PSG
The Brazilianist Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, reports the news agency AFP.
On Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona in the Spanish league.
Neymar’s agreement with Barcelona was therefore dismantled and was free to move to the Paris Society to PSG.
The sum of the transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the Manchester United had a record that cost EUR 105 million last summer for Paul Pogba, French.
The PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatar Company Qatar Sports Investment.
The company is chaired by a former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaif, Qatari.
Neymar is supposed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
The success writer Raja Oranen backed alcoholism and fear of flight hypnosis: "I'm fine with my life"
From the TV series, the time of Rose and the clean white sheets are known for the success writer Raja Oranen just spent his 69th anniversary.
Your hypnosis helped Raja Ora.
In addition to writing, five grandparents hold the grandma so that Raja and her husband, Jerki, gave up the Spanish sun and the apartment of Fuengirola after 18 winters.
First they sold their houses, but now in spring, the rental apartment also left.
To the light and the sun, away from the old circles, Raija once took depression and alcoholism, which he has survived.
It's 20 pounds lighter, too.
The weight went down when the serotonin medicines were stopped, they were mental medicines.
Alcoholism used to help me with hypnosis, which also affected the fear of the flight, I won it.
I've been out of alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes people, the radiating writer says openly.
Raja and Jerki Oranen have traveled the same way for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
For more than 40 years, Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the tourism sector, has traveled together.
I asked, and it was getting married in two weeks, and Raja laughs.
She's always been the queen of a drama like that, she's finished her life with that, and she laughs at her wife.
A large number of writer careers made by Orane remember only with good 44 parts Clean white sheets on TV series that touched and moved the lama time in Finland.
I finally decided to be the business of the family company when I read a 50-year-old interview on a plane at Liisa Seppälä.
I was the daughter of the seamstress myself, my mother also had a dressing shop and sometimes acted as a mankekin, orange remembers.
He thought that a series of ideas and the story changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Saveisen's investigation and the protest revealed it, Oranen says.
Raja Oranen lives as a writer of active time, has many manuscripts under work for hundreds of ideas.
The circulars returned over the door to the "millionaires' alley"
The wealthiest houseowners in West Midlands are once again furnished with stubborn circulators who managed to cross the door that was missed by the municipality and return to the field next to the houses.
The circulars parked 20 caravans near the street of the millionaires called Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the city’s cavalry that was needed as an obstacle, and they brought children, horses, and the army of vans.
The circulars managed to cross the barrier that had been left unprotected because of the path.
The rabies have accused the municipality of Solihulll of "the complete inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident tells the circulars to come from Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had been thrown by the rocks.
"But it must be hardened to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The circulars were here in May, and then they left, but they returned again.
There were more of them last night and probably even more today."
The resident told me that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
"Asun Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the circulars returned so soon after they were driven away.
"They're more of them than before, and they've even counted a horse into a park."
According to the municipality of Solihull, the municipality is aware of the illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal measures with the Solihull police to eliminate the campsites as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that as many locals as possible report to the police on disrupting or criminal activities.
It will help to draw a picture of the situation for judicial proceedings."
The raging people surrounded Portugal’s Destruction Machine
In Portugal, men who have been forced to land on a beach full of people have been questioned today in the court of law.
Two people were killed yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
Two men flying a plane may be charged with death.
In Portugal, at its least, you can get 16 years of captivity.
The small plane flying by men was forced to land at the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon, because of a technical error.
There were hundreds of people on the beach during the event, some of whom ran the landing plane to escape into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and a 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit a man who was on the back plane.
Soon after the plane was upwards, and when it landed again, it hit the baby’s head, told Philip Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who was killed was at the beach with her parents.
The parents of the girl didn't get hurt.
The people at the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started hitting it, telling me the case was witnessed in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle that no more people died.
The two men on the plane did not get hurt in a forced landing.
The sadly lost leg of the Finnish monkey won MM-Gold again: "I would not be the world champion of the accident."
Matti Big Hamari celebrated early Wednesday morning in Finland's time MM-gold at the banked slalom in the Canadian Big White competition.
The Great Hamari used to win the Cross MM gold in the races.
Three MMs have already been gathered.
That's some amazing MM contests!
Two times treated with gold, a pretty good heartbeat pulled, a telephone targeted the Great Hamari rejoiced.
The 30-year-old calculator praised his coach and very successful preparations in Finland.
According to the Great Hamar, the number of fighters in the species is increasing all the time.
The whole paraluminum boarding has grown and has evolved very much in recent times.
Differences are falling, and there are many new calators involved.
He's always wondering if there's a black horse coming back.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
The Great Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eagerly falling with his friends since his youth, and the accident did not take the desire to get to the front.
It reminds me at times that what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's for nothing to do with it.
On those cards you play, which are shared, the Great Hamari emphasises.
It would be cruel to tiger a serious accident and the loss of wreckage into a luck trap, and the Great Hamari will not do that.
But he turned to a terrible difficulty.
I'd say it turned out to be a winner.
I wouldn't be a three-fold world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Big Hamar's biggest boarding was already falling.
I mean, it's not until after the accident.
When I was young, I was training with guys, and we were always inclined to kill X-Games.
But they were far-reaching wounds that had been narrowed up in some time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow at the X-Games start.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I wondered if this would be a really long life if I stayed here to get bitter and tormented.
I decided to pull the wrists in the neck and start working.
I'd say I've done quite well.
The calculator was very pleased with the choice of a wheelchairist Leo-Pekka Star as a year's athlete.
Four times the Olympic winner received his prize in the sports gala in January.
The Great Hamar says Star victory is an important signal to the parasites.
It was a big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open eyes on the para sports world.
Because it's time to launch the double world champion Matti Big Hamar year sports campaign?
We'll see it in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Not yet, the Great Hamari has not conquered all of the peaks that he wants.
Next year, there will be a great goal.
A year later, the Paralympics will be visiting South Korea.
They're going to get the medal!
A majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and Isis is the source of the country
The Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study revealed the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees in the brewing of bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
They say that the end of the Syrian war and Isisi's departure from the country are the most important things that should happen to enable them to return to their home country.
Trump's administration does not see a change in the Syrian conflict.
The communications office chain Burson-Marsteller investigated the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
Burson-Marsteller has already studied the opinions and attitudes of the Arab youths in nine years.
This year A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees studied the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian young people aged 18 to 24, half of which are women and half men.
Half of the interviews were carried out in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
Of the respondents, 42 per cent may think that they would return to their home country and 4 per cent could not say.
According to the study, young people’s decision to return home is most affected by the war in Syria and Isisi’s presence in the country.
Nearly half (47%) sees the end of the war as the most important factor for the permanent return to home, while a quarter believes that Isisi's departure would be the most important.
Only less than a tenth will be the main elements of the decision to be the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action does not solve the conflict alone
Syrian youths were asked what is the most important factor for the conclusion of the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more important than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter keeps Al-Assad's President as an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Almost half of the experience is that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current Syrian conflict.
The solution to this conflict is simply through military action that does not believe just a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugee youths see Isisi’s power deteriorated during the last year, while the fifth sees its power stronger.
According to the respondents, the main fight against Issis and generally against terrorism is that the media will inform people of the fact that Isisi has nothing to do with Islamic faith.
Almost equally many made military measures and training reforms a priority.
For the tenth part of fairness, it is important to create jobs that are better employed for young people.
When questioning the effects of Trump’s administration on the Syrian conflict 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during Trump’s regime.
Almost every four believes that the Syrian conflict will worsen during the Trump season.
The opinions are divided in two respects as to whether the participation of Russia and Iran has improved or aggravated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the Internet in order to stay in order to use Wikipedia and Google for example.
The Espoo company MariaDB develops an open source database that is the fastest growing in the world.
The main product of the MariaDB, founded by the coding company Michael "Monty" Widenius, does not pay the users anything, and it can be developed through the Internet by any forward programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of a Finnish database, but they may not be payable customers.
With the help of databases, the huge data masses will remain in order and quickly accessible.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image form comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, acting as the MariaDB Technology Director, spends about half of his time coding.
The man who makes the distances of beautiful hands will help to ensure that the Internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database of MySQL together with the Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and one year later, Oracle left your appetite for Sun with 7.4 billion dollars.
When the Oracle trade took place, a large part of the MySQL developers reported to be leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who did not give a sure promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company that began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his lifework to die.
I hired a couple of the best developers from Sun, and so I made sure that the code was secured by the same friends that created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
All I had to do was change the name.
The freedom to monitor the development of the MariaDB code was established by the Foundation.
"At mySQL, these confirmations were not made," Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billions of deals, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"For the past few years, our growth rate has been about 50% per year," says Ms Kenneth Paqvalén, Economic Manager of MariaDB.
The growth-oriented MariaDB is not yet profitable, and Paqvalén is scarce in the company's profiles.
As much as he reveals that, during the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive orders for EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed around services for which business customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be more than a year's career if the customer has used a closed database.
MySQL switches to MariaDB will be successful in the moment because they are versions of each other.
For example, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in South-East Asia are the customers paid by MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoftin Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB is automatically spreading to new users in the distribution packages of Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest gamblers.
"There are one of the largest telecom operators in the world, gambling companies, banks, and even some central bank," on the list of Paqvalé.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in their closed databases.
Oracle also has MySQL modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although, according to the research company Gartner, the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, in turnover, players such as MariaDB are still insignificant, although fast-growing cinches.
About $50 billion in the database market, open source databases don't even reach a billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, as most users do not pay any of these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been exchanged to be open at that time, or the transition would at least be started.
Large companies will not receive new customers, as most of them will then choose an open source code.
This has resulted in the licensing fees for commercial databases.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to make a smaller number of customers," Widenius wonders.
Since the exchange of a closed database is a problem, most of the customers have taken up price increases with obedience.
"There are many customers to whom the transfer is really difficult because their old applications and others are closed in a closed database," says Widenius.
He still believes that the size of the clients is coming up.
When license payments rise every year, the customer will move to the open source database sooner or later.
The price is 10-20 per cent of the previous, and the service is better, as the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants to.
Furthermore, many companies are facing major system changes when they transfer their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a loan of EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now about to hire more.
One of the reasons for the financing of the EIB was the impact of MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has public-sector customers, for example, in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros per year on databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more effectively," says Paqvalén.
Widenius is upset about spending money in Finland on closed health systems, even when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not on the mercy of one software company.
Some say the open source code is ideology, but I think it's a better way to make the code.
The community will help and do something that is not invented or capable of doing.
The 55-year-old Widenius belongs to another Finnish developer, Linus Torvalds, who develops Linux, along with the most famous promoters of the open source code.
Widenius will help other companies develop operational business models over an open source code.
I still hold 4-5 speeches every year across the world on this subject.
Italy intensifies its attitude to civil society rescue ships
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations who save refugees from their ships in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to operate unless they are committed to comply with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue their activities," Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the newspaper La Stampa in Torino.
Minnit’s warning came from the day that the Italian authorities had invaded a German Jugend Rettt Assistance Ship, which is suspected of co-operation with human smugglers, which contributed to illegal immigration.
For only one year, the aid organisation refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosion.
"For us saving lives is and will be the most important thing, and we are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the area of search and rescue," the organization announced in its opinion published in the social media.
"We can only assess the accusations once we have gathered all the necessary information and we can evaluate the situation."
Since October, the Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa vessel of the Jugend Rettt.
The crew is suspected to take on board the ship by boat refugees directly from human smugglers who re-enforced the boats.
One of these cases is alleged to have occurred only a few miles from the coast of Libya, and the information is shown in the document of the prosecutor, whose contents have been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, which controls rescue operations in the region, which is regarded as a motive for the enthusiasm of helping.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships like Iuventa must be involved by an Italian police officer who controls the activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue activities have so far agreed to follow the policy: Save Children and Maltese MOAS, as well as the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable on Thursday, as they would not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the rescue activities of the organisation.
Among those who refuse to comply with the policy, the Nobel-recorded Doctors Without Borders is an organisation.
Minniti, on the other hand, noted that the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue measures has been severely reduced over the past few weeks, which he considers as evidence of the fact that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal guard and cooperation with local mayors are starting to produce results.
"The last days have started seeing light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He revealed that the plans will continue discussions this month with the Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Tsjad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving towards Europe.
A seasonal employee is suspected of killing his parole with Enontekio, suspect found on the ground - a case for the prosecutor.
The suspected crime took place at the Enontekikö Quuts last December.
According to the police, a Czech 36-year-old man was suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish coworker.
In the past, it has been said that both of them were seasonal workers.
Also, the police have told us that the suspect would have fled with two dogs.
The man was found cold in the field, and he did not resist when he was caught.
We'll have to charge the case in less than a week.
The case may still be dealt with in the Lapland Court of Justice in August.
From Harry Potter and all my hairy friends, Robert Hardy is dead.
British actress Robert Hardy died when he was 91.
The actor's death was announced by this family on Thursday.
Hardy, born in 1925, started his actor career at the theater when he was 24.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is especially reminded of the role of the Magic Minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter movies and his veterinarian role in a series of all hairy friends, based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC's popular series was filmed through seven.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to commit suicide in writing.
A woman in Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for texting and calls that were considered to bring her boyfriend Conrad Roy to suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, executes 15 months of his sentence in prison and five years under parole.
Carter was sentenced to murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said on Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter filed a review of the judgment and was able to wait for the application to be filed in freedom.
He was threatened by a sentence of 20 years, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy were suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and cream - colored blouse, listened to his judgments on the cross with a crying look on the ground.
"He was killed by Conrad Roy," the prosecution said to the court.
"He decided Conrad's life to improve his own.
He hasn't taken responsibility for the action," the prosecution continued.
"He hasn't shown any regret."
According to Carter's attorney, the case was caused by the "secure circumstances that Carter regrets deeply."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, felt that Carter had no significant influence on what he did at age or maturity or even on mental health problems.
The prosecution read the statement of Conrad's mother Lynn Roy, saying, "I won't take a day to not cry my beloved son's death.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I get through this, and I am trying to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister, Camdyn Roy, told me rightly that she's "no" idea that she's never gonna see her brother's wedding and she's not aunt for her children.
"It's painful to lose a person who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain never passes," Camdy said.
The case seems to be a precedent, because there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that provoking suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car for cage poisoning dead in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had provoked his boyfriend to commit suicide.
"Shut yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages that he had sent to Roy in the two weeks before he died. Roy was on vacation with his family at that time.
Just a little before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter would not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the opinions of experts.
Only a few have defended Carter, one of the defendants is Amanda Knox, 30 who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion paper saying, "Michelle Carter needs sympathy and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: Transferring Russia to the worst of the cold war
The military union between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Mr Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we were hoping that we could pursue close cooperation with Russia.
However, in particular since the unlawful merger of Crimea in 2014 and because of the continued instability of Russia in the Eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has worsened considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting so that the tensions are not exacerbated.
As long as we are strong and as predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid a rising situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, President Donald Trump of the United States found that the US-Russia was even at a dangerously bad level.
Trump called on the countries to thank the poorly-friendly congress, which adopted the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi makes changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the back attack experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi announced BMW offered to update more than 350 000 car software.
The director of BMW said that the company believes that there are more reasonable alternatives than driving restrictions. He referred to European cities, including the home town of BMW, Munich, who consider restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would make changes to the engines of more than three million Mercedes to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies were talking about being called back.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and in the United States to achieve the CO2 emissions targets.
The nitrogen oxide emissions of diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emissions neutralising equipment are rising, making cars difficult to price competitively.
German car manufacturers are closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been charged with the sympathy and misunderstanding of large car companies.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen set up fraud devices in cars, which reduced emissions to comply with the requirements for tests.
Several leaders in Volkswagen have been prosecuted in the United States, but the actions of leaders are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head responsible for the thermodynamics of Audi Motor Development was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
In the past this year, Audi was involved in the Volkswagen criminal investigation, and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed in its cars a system that could circumvent European emission standards, which was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The audit investigation may significantly undermine the position of Volkswagen: the share of the luxurious car manufacturer in Volkswagen's profits is disproportionate.
In Venezuela's vote, there was a blur, big demonstrations on the pledge
According to the company, the number of voters notified by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the actual number of voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role to play in the election results, Tibisay Lucena, Chairman of the National Election Board, said to journalists.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end
On Sunday, in Venezuela, a delegation was elected in the contested vote to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised protests against its change.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they are in progress at the time of appointment.
According to the newspaper El Pais, the national security forces of the country began to take over the parliamentary building of the country on Wednesday night.
The teams are intended to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence Lavender
Laventel has become a symbol of the region of Southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender had decreased due to drought and disease-producing insects, and researchers and farmers tend to try to find a solution to the problem.
"The lavender is directly threatened in the Provence region because it has suffered the effects of climate change over the last few years, with a clear reduction in the rain levels in the spring and in particular in the autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an expert in the CRIEPPAM research institute in Provence, which is specialised in agriculture.
"This will shorten the lifetime of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought many small cascades to the area that spread microbacteria."
The stakes are tough.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desired ingredient of perfume and cosmetics.
"Besides long stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or weakened or are missing completely," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are even fewer parts of essential oil."
The solution is sought by intensifying irrigation, slowing down the moisture of the soil and injecting with a mixture of clay and water that protects the plants, and developing more sustainable varieties of drought.
A reporter's murder is a growing threat in Mexico.
The delivery of a weekly Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and endless drug wars in the State of Sinaloa.
Today, however, there is a debate on safety due to the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been invited to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists will discuss which is safer: leave the children home or take them into the delivery of a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the alliance board in front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking journalists for names for each group, and they don't need evidence, findings and feelings are sufficient.
The name of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected to be on the wages of the government or the drug cartels, are criminals that make the chaos of Mexico life-threatening news.
In December 2012, at least 25 suppliers have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto entered office in December 2012, there are 589 suppliers who have been subject to attacks and threats. In the current year at least seven suppliers have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, supplier and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez, together, wrote about many of his books on drug violence.
He is deeply needed, even though he is everywhere. Riodoce’s building’s public image covers a huge image of Valdez’s midfinger. The picture says: "Justice." Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, 30-year-old journalists, are dressed in T-shirts that are cleaned by Valdez’ s smiled faces. Valdez has glasses and a palette hat formed as a trademark.
The meeting will be held less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists will discuss their joint trauma, their nightmares, their sleeplessness and their fears of paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was established, particularly for the treatment of journalists' cases, but according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two charges have been raised so far.
Only rarely, journalists are subject to justice, as are few of the thousands of murders related to drug trafficking and organised crime every year.
The journalists of Riodoce are going to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are broken by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little benefit because the killers are not aware and there is no hope for justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the event."
Valdez had withdrawn from the delivery of Riodoce in the capital of the state in Culiacan in the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had driven his red Toyota only a few blocks away when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The number is supposed to be related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means 12 rivers.
The shooter drove away from Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left to die by a wife and two grown-up children.
The rumors move quickly and demand free in Culiacan.
However, the death of Valdez is a mouse cramp.
Sinaloa has been the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to die daily, and the cemetery land has decorative double-floor burial buildings that are larger than many homes.
The state on the coast is "safe" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, the 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published a Damaso Lopez interview, leading a competing group that wars against the Guzman boys.
The case may have upset the Guzman boys: the customers who suspected members of the gang bought each issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to the sales points.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after the other magazine published the same story became the target of an attack.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues no longer knew how to fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up five colleagues with Riodocen. The paper shares were sold at that time for $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalistism without dealing with the drug problem," says Bojorquez.
In time, the magazine began to feel its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenues increased.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard - class research journalistics without fear of the censorship, and readers were fascinated in the magazine with stories that no one else dare to publish.
Eight years after he was founded, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez received a prize for international press release from the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, with the courage to follow the story of Mexican drug trafficking without aggravating it.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to continue my life," he said when he received the prize of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
In Sinaloa, the drug deal is a "lifestyle", Valdez said in the interview of the Rompevinto TV last October.
"The measureer must accept the task falling upon him – or act stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when death was bathed here – why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez — a joke who cursed like a port worker — a friend who always received a hug and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routines.
He used the panama hat all the time.
He went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the delivery and sat at the same table.
Now they ask if the routines came into his destiny.
The death of a colleague has also led them to reflect on how they can best do their job and survive.
"The criminals do not like us dealing with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug deal runways.
They were left out of the case," Bojorquez says.
In the best case, it meant strong self-sufficiency and self-protection,
trusting in your own instincts.
If it feels like it's not all right, you have to stay away.
Andres Villarreal, a journalist of Riodoce, said that "the impression can be deceived, and that's what happened in Javier's case."
The old rules no longer apply to Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
No mobile phones were allowed to be imported into the room where Riodocte’s security training was held. A few days earlier, it had been revealed that only spying programs sold to governments had been followed by activists and suppliers in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought the shadow of a tree from a height of 40 degrees.
The State Government had assigned them to guard Riodoce premises located in a four-fold building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some of the journalists quoted half their plays whether these two cops belonged to the 50% group that the governor of the state considered not to be reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited the mountainous landscapes of the drug gangs.
To this week's number, Riodoce delivered three main cases.
The size of the fights Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The paper was also about to reveal that the government’s money was focused on the governor’s hometown.
In addition, together with the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, only a block from the prosecution office, there was a kidnapped group of people.
There was no official information on who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to move forward with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favour of both drug dealers and public authorities.
The reporter found out in public documents that the restaurant was registered to the names of a politician from the PRI, a dominant institutional revolutionary party, and that the PRI has ruled Mexican policy at all levels for almost a century.
The governors involved have recently been charged with corruption in cases that have been publicised.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous cases at the same place. One of them El Chapo Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid military raids.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez had been able to obtain reliable information about kidnapping.
"We would have already known what had happened," says the 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received a scar because of his body structure, the favorite name "El Flaco", Ohukainen.
"Now all the connections to our sources are broken."
Valdez's workroom has been transformed into a warehouse that preserves signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists. Press workers have received a new, unexpected task: they have become activists driving press freedom.
The reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs when he left the next morning to the local prosecutor's office for the demonstration of the murder of a new reporter.
El Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was murdered in the western state of Michoacan.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, was Adame.
Journalists have started to protest louder throughout the country.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, Washington, where he tries to obtain international support for Valdez's case.
On the day following Valdez's murder Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they were telling the truth.
He has subsequently asked that he should be removed from the government cases because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists are surrounded by organised crime, by authorities allowing crime and by an indifferent society.
In its last book, Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed in agreement with organised crime on command of politicians and security forces.
According to the Articulo 19 control group, more than half of the attacks on suppliers last year were carried out by the police and the authorities.
"In Mexico people will be silenced by killing," says Ramirez.
Murders have a depressive effect.
No one will forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the border state of Tamaulipas in the north six years ago.
Her body had a message signed by the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my writing."
Beside his cut off head, there was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the magazines have decided to cease their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern Chihuahua border state after the malicious murder of Correoslava Breach.
Some continue to act, like Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though his leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to drug maps: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have escaped from their state or the whole country.
It's a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and you must be careful all the time.
Sometimes criminals are looking for a journalist, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a flat in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he escaped from Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — who once had to become a poet — admits that writing about drug trafficking frightens me.
"I became a reporter because Mexico is on his way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, the journalists of Riodoce sat at midnight in front of the delivery on a pedestrian beer when the latest issue of the magazine was completed. Suddenly, their phones began to mark the message from the color.
In the shooting between rival gangs and security forces in Mazatlan, 19 people had died.
The war accelerated, as was promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists put the news on Riodoce's website from the walkway with their smartphones.
The first page was to be reloaded the next day.
Sirens cried nearby — a new shooting scene.
Bojorquez looked at the police guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The delivery of Riodoce continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive picture, where the man shows the middle finger to the whole Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says that you can't even consider stopping action. "How could I stop the magazine when our trainee asked us to get on the street to do the case the same day that Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Mannisen's Olympiade project started with a huge back attack, "Small place"
In April, Hannu Mannisen’s 39 - year - old party remained short, for the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympics.
However, the period of training began catastrophicly when Manninen became ill with the flu.
It started a long period of illness, which stretched almost five weeks.
May practically went completely ill.
At first, there was flu and, finally, a child’s disease like an ear infection to which I had to eat antibiotics.
I was only able to make ten percent of the planned exercises.
I don't remember the last time I've been so sick.
It was a tough place when I couldn't take advantage of the practice, Manninen's gonna tell the night-Sanom.
The test result collapsed
The world champion of 2007 only received a traineeship permit in the second week of June, which was seen in the Kihpa and Top Sports Research Centre on 12 June.
In the test, an athlete skies with rolls on a mat, whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the mat stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a milk acid sample from the finger of the athlete on the needle.
Last autumn, I ran 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I just stayed 28 minutes.
He came against the wall, Manninen tells me.
In the right direction
After the initial rights, Manninen says he's still healthy.
I have done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises to normalize the metabolism of the body.
Now there's a really good five-week episode in the back.
Juhannus was also a year and a half of his vacation from the flight home.
I also had time to go to the cabin with my family.
In the last season, Manninen only participated in four World Cup competitions before the Lahden MM homecomings.
The best result was seen in the opening competition as soon as Manninen got on top of the 18th.
Guidelines drawn
The main coach of Manninen and the rural team Petter Kukkanen has made a training and competition plan for the next February.
Now we're going to get a different rhythm compared to the last season.
After the first race, Ruka would have a three-world Cupcake weekend.
In December, the purpose would be to be in at least one of the world cups this weekend, perhaps Ramsau.
At the end of January, the plans would still be in Sefeld.
After that, I hope you find the name on the Olympiad team's list, Manninen says.
The Olympics in Pyeongchang would already be the Sixth Winter Olympics for Mannis.
Now, the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City, 2002 in the gold team competition celebrated the Nummelian underline.
Dinosaur was protected by masking his enemies.
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now researchers have revealed the first research results of the complete nature of the horn clay found by a Canadian miner, which had been so well preserved that the experts call it the dinosaurs Mona Plus.
It had survived so well that researchers could even determine that its smooth skin was red - brown and had had a "problematic past".
According to the Current Biology, it is the most armed dinosaur and the best representatives of its species in the world.
The recently found fossil is a nodosaurus, which was in the middle of the accession period 110 to 12 million years ago.
Researchers consider this amazingly well preserved fossils a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, plant-fooded vegetarians have been the best preserved fossil ever in their species.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium Mine in North Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and was found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit someone who did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to examine his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the Rock was sent to Tyrrelli's royal paleontological museum.
There, for six years, the beast was extracted from a hundred pounds of slabs.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
"If you squeeze your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep," says scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher in the Royal Museum of Tyrrelli.
"It remains in the history of science as Mona Lisana of the dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
In skin studies, it was found that meat - eating dinosaurs were likely to be a major threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a tank and reminded of a walking tank.
Its red - white tank masked it from the predators, and it was also protected by darker and lighter colors below, which are still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to mix with its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million - year - old nodosaurus rose in May, and is now present in Tyrrelli's royal paleontological museum.
According to Mark Mitchell, researchers have named it from Boralope to Markmichelli Museum. Mitchell was part of a team that took over 7 000 hours to dig up a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly that Mitchell and the international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body’s spoons and panzers.
They found that it was still protected by a general color in the animal world, where the body is darker and lighter than its head.
However, the observation was surprising because Borelope is considerably larger than the present animals with similar coloring.
It can be concluded that the meat - eating dinosaurs have embraced it to the extent that evolution favours hiding as a means of survival instead of fighting.
From the present animals, for example, peuros, zebras and armadillos, they have similar colors, which are considerably smaller and therefore easier catches, suggesting that nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"The capture of a large, strong armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous dinosaurs were for the joining season," says Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the Nodosaurus swabs reveals that its skin was red brown.
Scientists will continue to study nodosaurus to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its intestine, to find out what it ate in his last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell to the river when he died and went to the sea, where it drowned into the bottom of the sea.
At that time Alberta was as warm as it was in Florida today, and rivers and seas were likely to extend far beyond today.
"This nodosaurus is really significant because its finnish skin has been preserved and has also survived in three dimensions in its original form," says Brown.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early period of accession.
It doesn't require much imagination: if it shrinks a bit of eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep."
The time of the theropods, the vast two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Even though their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, that is millions of years earlier Borelopeta, his mighty predecessors may have captured this armed dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, Acrocanthosaur, a monster of about 11,5 metres long six tons.
The latest findings of the Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology. They believe that Boralope was choking into the sea after his death and mummyed into the mummies.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium Mine in North Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and was found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armored dinosaur from the skull to the skin and the skull of its armores to the hip.
The nodosaurs were on average five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kilos.
Two half-metres of their stages were lifted.
Researchers believe that this armored vegetarian went through the present West Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has preserved small details in the underwater grave.
Its fossilated remains are so well preserved that its skin remains on the panther’s hollow plates along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such a survival is "one rare than a lottery victory.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
Its skull skull plates still have fossiled skin.
Its right interests are on its side, five upwards.
I can also calculate the spoons of that footbed."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Whose streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from his home in St. Louis and sat on his Airbnb's bed with his Facebook phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"The police just killed a 18-year-old young man, and his body is still on the street."
He was shocked to notice that no one else had posted the same information in his application, so he closed up Facebook and opened up on Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retwistings from @TheePharaoah.
The username belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who twitted in real time from Michael Brown's death, and the white police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter later that night, people were told that the Canfield Drive would be gathering.
The users posted pictures of police locks and screaming people, as well as of the man who claimed to be Brown's father, who was wearing the sign: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video footage where the police stood in front of the protesters with the dog blazing.
He also tells me that he saw a video where another policeman put his rifle in and yelled, "I kill all of you... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers what he's proven.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we've already used to and could be called typically.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and I was crying."
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11:00 a.m., and Ferrell came to pick up his six-year-old daughter's father and decided they'd go to Ferguson the next morning.
About what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years, the documentary "Whose Streets" has been made. It was first night in film theaters on 11 August 2017.
The picture is a story of survival, mental expression, love, loss, strength and strength from the perspective of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell traveled towards Ferguson’s flowers and their daughters, who were dressed with a crown compatible with it, they went back to a discussion about what is to live in black and in what circumstances. They had spoken countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe?" Ferrell remembers what he said to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't leave my daughter with me," Ferrell told me later.
"The events of this day are the peak of past events.
My daughter has the right to know and grow in it.
He must be able to activize and organize, but he must also feel the different layers and conditions of the life experience in black, and he must know what we need to do to free ourselves.
Although, fortunately, I have been able to protect him from filthy racism, he is still the same as the other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt her if I protected her from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florisant Road, located on the other side of the police station, which became a camping place for activists, waiting for information about the case and eventually learned that there would be no charges against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughters went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My act was completely changed after the 9th of August," he says. While studying at the University of Missouri, in St. Louis, Ferrell was chairman of the Nursing Society of Minority Students. At that time he focused on food rights and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the document.
Folayan said that he and the photographer of Lucas Alvarado-Farrar “simply wanted to tell me” what was happening.
She said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The suspicion was based on the countless times when people had appeared in the local community, usually white people who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and strength.
"We had heard that those who were born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," said Folayan recently in the interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, known as his activists for deadly prisoners.
Davis' involvement led Ferrelli to join the project together with six other locals. The group followed events following Brown's shooting in the years.
"This is not a document where someone speaks or speaks for us, but we speak," says Davis.
"It was most important to me how local people were presented in a movie because I was presented in the same way."
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience because it was wanted to show that the public movement "not about a charismatic leader, but about the community".
That is why the document sees a surprising private side of Ferrelli’s life, such as love and marriage.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he told me how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human picture of the blacks require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story is once and brings back the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter.
The movement was born in the social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot a black teen boy, Trayvon Martin, in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement are identified as queer identity.
"The leadership of the Musti's queer women has kept the whole movement," says Ferrell. "That's because we have to fight all the time in many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "The black women who really maintain the movement, among whom there are many queer women."
However, he stressed that Ferrell was not chosen "self-determined" because of its queer identity.
"He's got energy moving," says Folayan.
"But it's not a coincidence that she was in the front line. Black queer women live on many things at the surgery site, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy is transferring from the white canal."
The film teams of the news have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the community and the police are still tense.
Ferrelli's still got two and a half years on parole, and he's sentenced to blocking the highway in the demonstration.
His description of the social policy climate in his home corners is short and core: "The mess."
Yet he continues to rely on the slogan that he learned from outside in Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"It is our pleasure to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chain."
Appropriate ambiguity: the artist creates shapes of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has been hanged in the middle of the exhibition area with the faces – white, black and brown faces, between which, more accurately viewed, can be seen of ambiguity.
These 30 works are designs made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where he executed his sentence of 35 years, and Manning was convicted of the leaking of classified diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks website.
The Dewey-Hagborg A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, IT and art in his work. Manning is a transnaissant and career-strong dissident whose prison sentence Barack Obama reduced his term of office on the third day of his last day.
Dewey-Hagborg analyses Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 figures based on his genetic data. They are sharp, although a slightly theoretical contribution to the reconstruction of DNA data, multidisciplinarity and the underlying causal consequences of interpretation and identity.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has been openly informed that he has been identified with women since the breakdown. In 2013 he was found guilty of 20 crimes, including violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning, a grey, black-white selfie, where Manning is sitting in the car on the driver's seat. He's got a platinum elevated wig on his head, which became his sign.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had the Stringer Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
It's where he created shapes on the basis of criminal information, and he received DNA information, for example, about tobacco tubs and chews, and he created pictures of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their story," Dewey-Hagborg reported a new exhibition at a press conference.
He couldn't go to Manning's house, and he couldn't be filmed in prison, so the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making Manning's DNA image.
The artist and his imprisoned music suddenly became correspondents, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even made a Suppressed Images series book, which was imagined by Shoili Kanungo, where the president would have relieved Chelsea’s judgment and would be able to see the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shortened the judgment of Manning only a few days after the publication of the comic book, which was a lucky coincidence after seven hard years spent in a nationwide military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is opened right now that Donald Trump is taking his own war against information leakers and trans-sex soldiers and is still inventing new ways to strengthen the powerful two-ways he actually had to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that everyone has a purpose.
The gallery has an artist's statement on the wall, and under it a great signature by Manning, where the heart is the point of the genealogy i. The artist demands an end to the "automatic division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture have been based".
The opposite wall has Manning's DNA episode: a long line of letters C, G and A written on a lead pen.
This combination of 200 letters – or nucleotides, such as the artist’s scientific definition – would like to show us how we are all, at least from our biology.
"I wish my exhibition to help people understand that we are equal to our gene and that genetic data are very personal and open to interpretations," says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also shows his film of Spurious Memorials from 2007.
"DNA tells a lot of stories, and there's 30 of them."
The final job of the exhibition is in its own room: page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg's comic book.
That's where Manning's character is rising from prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
"If they can slow you down, they've won," the picture says.
"Don't ever shut up."
"The text is from the letter I received from Manning," says a artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive I'm still getting cold colors."
Contrary to the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he was greeted by the faces based on his own genetic data as a group of demonstrators in the centre of the exhibition.
It is deliberately, like all the others in this exhibition: for example, the Manning DNA cycle is written on a lead pen at a height that is the same as his length (157.5 cm).
"The faces were on the wall earlier, but I wanted to bring them the feeling of a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to describe a crowd movement born by Chelsea, which was also behind his liberation."
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University are searched for murder suspects.
Police report that they have launched national searches to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is suspected of stabbing a man to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
The Cook County Justice documents indicate that on Monday, the arrest warrants were issued on Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death.
According to the records, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after he had been stabbed several times.
According to a local release published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
The police in the Grand Plaza building found a victim with several slices in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found to be dead at the scene and the stab was investigated as a murder and the police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for Social Relations at the University, said in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now free of administration and is prohibited from access to the Northwestern University camps.
"This is a criminal case investigated by the authorities, and Northwestern University helps in the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
In an e-mail from the university and somerville College, the opinion states that "we have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and we are ready to help the investigation authorities in the United States in all possible ways."
The opinion also stated that Mr Warren's colleagues are shocked and hoped he would surrender.
Anthony Gugliemi, head of information at the Chicago Police Department, said that he was calling on suspects to give themselves seriously to the authorities.
"Polices have an idea of where they are, and we keep making our searches clear," said Guglimistemi.
According to the Gugliels, local, regional and national authorities will assist in the search of suspects.
He reported that the police had received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague indication that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the vision at the scene as terrible.
According to Gugliels, it's unclear if the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," says Gugliemi.
The Grand Plaza Board published the following release to the citizens: "Police is currently investigating the course of events and the victim's background and potential motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
The man threatened to blow up a Islamic bookstore and kill Muslims in London.
"I'm not an anti-muslim, I'm a Catholic," the convict said to the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced to blow up the Islamic bookstore in London and to kill all Muslims.
According to the Independent newspaper, David Moffatt was condemned, among other things, for serious harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore staff alerted them on May 23th.
According to the staff, the man had threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill Muslims.
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt got caught when he called the police about the threat.
The threat had nothing to do with the events of the bookstore.
The authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same costume as the suspect in the bookstore, said the police reporter.
I'm not an anti-muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the cops about interrogation.
As a fine, a man must carry out 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay 620 pounds of legal costs, i.e. about EUR 690 and EUR 85, which means EUR 95.
According to Scotland Yard's reporter, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete the WADA Roadmap in the near future" – Vice-President of Russia, Vitaly Mutko
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitavily Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the activities of the World Antidoping Office's Road Map of WADA to restore the powers of RUSADA of the Russian Antidoping Commission.
"Part of the road map measures have already been implemented, and RUSADA was entitled to design and test in cooperation with UKAD of the British Antidoping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in these parts,"Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap, which defines the conditions for restoring RUSADA's powers. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to the complication, it does not contain anything that concerns Russia.
"Everything has been notified, and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympics Committee and WADA in the near future," but added.
However, one of the points on the road map requires that the Russian antidoping authorities publicly accept the results of the investigation carried out by the WADA, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren is investigating the state’s alleged share in the Russian sport doping.
That was what Mutko said: "The investigation is ongoing because our antidoping system has admitted a failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no national programmes, and we can't admit something that didn't exist."
The words of Mutko included echoes on the opinion of Vitaly Smirnov, the chairman of the Russian independent public antidoping committee.
On the same day, Mr Smirnov, speaking to the Russian RSport sports media, admitted that there have been problems in the Russian antidoping body. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial statements and regulations.
We are not going to accept the report on a conditional basis," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping surveillance in Russia in November 2015, after the scope of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, it was authorised in June last year to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
The leader of WADA, Olivier Niggli, visited RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he noted that the organization was on the right road to return the mandates.
British organization skeptical about the lovely innovation for Finnish people: There is no evidence of the health benefits of maternity packets
The British organization suspects the benefits of Finnish maternity packs.
Among other things, BBC and Guardian reports that the Lullaby Trust, which fights cottage death, prohibits the use of their own brochures in mother packs that can be distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packs to all pregnant women starts this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that a maternity pack would reduce the risk of a cow death.
A hidden death means a baby's unexplained sudden death.
Lullaby Trust is an expert on the health authorities of the United Kingdom at the stage of the child’s safe sleep.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed in them, because it would allow us to understand that we recommend this product, the organization informed us.
Finland has one of the lowest children's mortality readings in the world, only two dead per thousand born.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as a small number of teens.
To give every family a box, there may be one factor.
However, that cannot be said with certainty, Mr Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packs are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and coupling deaths.
The maternity pack is a Finnish invention and has been granted free to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package contains various items, such as child clothing.
This year, there are 53 products in the pack.
The pack itself is a box of cardboards where the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes distributed by it meet all the security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standards as a bedplace for cardboard boxes.
According to Lullaby Trust, the package may be the best option for a bed if there is no snack or surface bed available.
The organisation recommends that the package be used only for day sleep and stop using it when the child is able to turn around.
The organisation also recommends keeping pets out of the packaging and ensuring that it does not get wet or dirty.
Once again, a squirrel escaped from the Japanese zoo
The staff of the Japanese zoo is looking for a escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff with its speed and escaped again in two weeks.
The Turtle escaped from the Zoo of Shibukawa in Okayama, West Japan, on Tuesday morning.
The security cameras revealed that the monkey left the zoo through the main entrance.
It won't die immediately because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we're very concerned, and Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo, told us.
The 35-year-old snake is a female, 55-pound and about a yard long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the time of opening, the monkey shall be free to travel to the area of the branch.
The zoo hasn't received eyewitness findings from the turtle.
The last runaway of the board happened a week ago.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, and Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your company avoid Uber's errors
Amy Ellent wanted to measure the satisfaction of the workers in their online trading startup, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured me that the surveys were anonymous, some workers were suspicious about them.
"The figures were simply not consistent or objective," Agrett says. His hair care company Madison Reed focuses on online trade. The company has 75 employees.
It decided to use the outsider's help.
The market has become increasingly new types of staff management startups that help other companies to find out how their employees can.
They develop and licensed software that can measure the commitment of workers. Companies can conduct surveys and target them to certain teams and population groups, and provide their employees with anonymous reporting services and, in some cases, direct contact with the government through the top management.
"Other health can be followed by applications like Strava and Fitbit, but where does Fitbit stay?" asks the founder and CEO of the Glint-startup in Redwood City, Jim Barnett. Glint offers companies analytic software to measure employees' commitment.
She's been using Glint's software for three years, and she says she's got a deeper view of the thoughts and feelings of her employees.
The programme can make quick surveys and votes for certain teams and also create a map of which can be seen with one view of the departments where the employees are more unsatisfactory and who the leaders have received the weakest estimates.
Companies have realised that they have to monitor the workplace culture in order not to become the next Uberia. A transport company has died since a former employee wrote in his blog about a culture where workers are being harassed and troubled.
For starters like Glint, such negligence is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and conformity are a global sector with a value of over €18.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments website.
Convercent in the state of Colorado, Denver, is a startup that helps companies to detect and prevent undue behavior. The interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber’s reputation experienced a crash.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It recently made an agreement with Uber too.
Like Glintin, Convercent allows companies to conduct tailored surveys, collect answers confidentially in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can anonymously report unnecessarily by SMS.
And if there's any reason to doubt the manager, the complaints will go directly to the company's government.
"The general opinion has been distracted by the authorities," says the founder of Convercent and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
He recalls that if a company treats its employees badly or does not act ethically, the consequences may be costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start to boycott the company, and it can also lose workers and become suspicious.
The Ruby Tuesday food chain has more than 25 000 employees in 500 locations. The company has been using Convertent for more than a year because it wants to ensure that workers are aware of the principles and procedures and easily access to the main office.
In the past, the practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out a phone number or an email address that was able to report to the main office. Then he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often an intimidating and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, Director of Law of Ruby Tuesday, who said it was difficult to follow complaints made by workers.
Previously, the problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be identified and treated faster.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the employee," says Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
At the same time, we protect our shareholders from proceedings in relation to employment.
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employees' commitment more seriously after the audit company Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of an unethical activity in the context of the Enron scandal.
Only through the social media, companies realized that they could no longer prevent their dirty laundry from making public investigations.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came into ethics control," says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged.
It is a business model and a possibility approved by venture capital investors, both Glint and Convercent have capital investors in support.
Convercent collected 10 million dollars of funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, which has collected a total of $47 million of capital.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has collected funding for a total of $60 million.
Investments are not surprising, given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
Many studies show that workers expect more jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Piilaakso, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a genuinely useful enterprise.
"Employers are more committed to the success of the company if they are entertaining and feel that they are listening and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Director of the LinkedIn company responsible for remuneration and well-being for workers.
Investors get profits when companies are successful, and companies are successful when employees are committed.
Third-party analytics tools are promising to strengthen employees' commitment, so it is not surprising that they are interested in investors.
According to experts in the workplace culture, information on employees' commitment is important,
but it is useless if it does not result in any action.
If a company asks its employees for feedback, it can be seen as a sign of a change.
And if the change is not quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of workers.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to have four thousand discussions," says Russell Raath, Director-General of the business management consultant, who has seen companies rely too much on gathering information.
"If an enterprise does not take action, workers start to wonder if they heard
And whether their opinions matter.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Ellentti, Madison Reed is currently conducting staff surveys on a monthly basis and is able to address the problem on the same day as it is announced at Glint.
After collecting feedback from frustrated workers on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication, Ellent was able to make changes to teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees even better and hopes that deeper understanding will help it to improve the sustainability of staff in the long term in a sector known for the large shift of workers.
"If an enterprise is not committed to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose workers," says Vitrano.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies."
In Sweden, 20-year-old men are suspected of concealing their naked neighbours, reports TT.
A woman in Göteborg had come home from the shower when she had noticed a cell phone hanging at the end of a nail outside her window.
The woman says that the cell phone camera shot in the apartment.
The woman who was terrified of the case had run into another room to dress.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had first been pulled up, but soon after that, it was recalculated into the window.
A suspected 20-year-old man has admitted that he had taken a picture of a woman.
However, he claimed that he was just taking pictures of a woman's face.
The video on the cell was removed, and the police had failed to return it to evidence.
In the hearings, the man has admitted an act, but he has denied that he was guilty of a crime.
The man he filmed was right to say that he loves his neighbor "he's insane".
According to the news office, the case is being prosecuted against a man.
Teachers demand more liquor in the autumn negotiation
The wage developments cannot be lower than, for example, in the export industry, but should be reduced, said Olli Luukkainen, President of the OAJ, on Thursday.
The temporary cut of public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which no way would have been involved in the examination of holiday allowance cuts.
In the area of municipality, agreements must only be concluded after the private sector's papers have been signed and the increase percentages are cleared.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, the OAJ's working conditions have been agreed in January.
Percentage targets Luukkainen has not yet revealed.
Luukkainen is also the Chairman of the Public Skilled Negotiations Organisation Juko.
Luukkainen: Holiday cash cut increases in earnings
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is deteriorating at the same time as the private sector's purchasing power increases.
According to Lukka, the periodic breakover increases the differences in earnings.
In Finland, the number of pupils per teacher must be determined.
Furthermore, the OAJ points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the best and the gaps between the weak are increasing all the time.
According to the organisation, the learning outcomes are deteriorating, and the differences between students and regions are increasing.
Bruins players' day was longer when the NCAA reduced daily exercises to two
It's almost 11 o'clock in the evening. A bunch of UCLA American football players have left to talk to the other side of the campus' new training fields.
Some have taken off their game shirts, their backs shining from the sweatshirt after the first day of the training camp.
For many of them, this few minutes of conversation is a midday break.
Players studying in summer courses at the university will return to the apartment after three hours of exercise to read the final tests. The next morning they will meet at the Wasserman football centre at 6:30 a.m.
"The next three days of harbors will come for these guys," Coach Jim Mora of Bruins says a little before Monday turns on Tuesday.
The university's roof organisation reduced the number of daily training courses together. The change was intended to reduce the number of players' work, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final final tests are held.
That is why the first three exercises of UCLA started over 15 minutes in the evening.
Restriction of training courses in one day means that more practice days have been made. This year, the camp started almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time during the continuous Westwood training period through Mora six, when exercises are held at the same time as summer courses.
Practice is intended to be held 18 times before 20 August, when the actual preparation for the season's opening game begins: UCLA will meet the Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says that she supported the NCAA rule change, even though it made the players' schedules even tighter.
"We're gonna load them really much for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think it'll be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
The UCLA closes the exercises from outside the camp. It is not easy, given the direct view from the training fields to the next parking area and to the Luski Center, a level hotel that has already been bombarded over the protective network on the back of the goal.
Bruins players are supposed to move to the hotel this weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The problem is that people can book a room and picture exercises from there on the video. It is not overreacted with concern.
The video described in exercises pays quite a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking area.
We'll do our best.
I'm not gonna put my head on it too much.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
The presidential elections will be held in Rwanda, Central African, on Friday, whose winner is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking for his third period, but in practice he has influenced the leadership of the country since 1994.
Then the rebel group RPF stopped the genocide organised by extremists.
Kagame was the commander of RPF.
Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of distortion of poverty statistics, for example.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to pursue, because the Constitution, which has been limited to the two periods of presidentiality, was amended.
However, Kagame in Rwanda is also a genuine leader.
During his time, social reforms have been made in Rwanda and international investment has been flown.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting a country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether the Liberal Multiparty Democrat is the right model for African countries.
However, even Kagame has promised his people more freedom after the land has been lifted up on their feet.
It could be a good time to start.
Facebook fights against false news by intensifying fact checks
Facebook intends to send possible false news to independent inspectors and present the results under the original article. The largest social network in the world reported this on Thursday.
The company published on its website a statement that it begins to use updated machine learning to identify false news. Possible false news is sent to the facts inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised that it is the biggest disseminators of false news. Many believe that the results of the US presidential election were influenced by false news in 2016.
The subject has risen to a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed in false news before the May presidential election and Germany preparing for the elections in September supports the plan to confine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that the fact-checks are being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"The people want to see what stories do not pass through the screen of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more informed what they read and share", Facebook's head of the news feed, Sara Su, wrote in the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the related articles and make further changes to his news feed to reduce false news.
The Birth of a Comic Book: The story of a castle
The small town of Scotland in Kent is now known as Squeez's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of stormy history behind it. Now this charming town in Bewlin River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, an old mopic hair writer.
"I think it's great to get to study the text written by a dead person more than 300 years ago," says Rhodes.
"I know a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand."
The book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edvardian time. Each story has been pictured by a different artist, a promising British comic artist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes based on archives. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose sources of inspiration were the documents of the British National Library.
"I moved to tears when I noticed a thumb print in the letter. The letter was written by a double agent who worked for the jacobits in the 17th century," Rhodes says.
"That was his print!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time the light was used as a fire.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on his own.
I love archives!"
With the support of the National Trust Foundation and the English National Art Council, a writer who was attracted to the old papers was able to live in the castle for almost four months, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent the days examining the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rares, such as hyena heads hanged on the walls and bottles of centuries in the whale.
He circulated in the ruins and landscapes of the old castle and discussed with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes also the book of imaginable artists.
Evening, he said, "He took whiskey and started writing."
The closer history of Scotland is quite unknown, since the castle was transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the last successor, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff of the Foundation was just about to start the doorway to the archive. Rhodes describes that archives had been held for hundreds of years in the same method: by taking everything extra to the attic.
The archives had diary books, letters from the times of the British Empire and maps of who owned anything. "You could imagine that the magical disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "However, these families fought for even one sting.
I remembered, "I think we'd be willing to give it to you."
Some of the stories of the book go from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It tells about a man who will soon be connected to the English peasant in 1381 after the castle was completed.
"The Knightly Familys of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"England's peasant monkey began in the same area, and I remembered that the rebellion could begin with a riot.
"Maybe these events are connected?"
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of the priest who Darrell’s family hid seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 17th century. He is said to set up his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was noted years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotland. "The men of the family seem to have been a lot of strangers, and they kept getting in debt and buying things they couldn't afford.
The men of Darrell's family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome friends who knew how to cure the heirs."
Now Rhodes is seeking new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about the Life Mountain, a paranoid in the early 19th century, where only a eutrophy land is left.
Scotney's castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," he says.
"I didn't want to go back to this evil coffin yet."
The worst in Russia, then the cold war.
The military union between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Mr Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we were hoping that we could pursue close cooperation with Russia.
However, in particular since the unlawful merger of Crimea in 2014 and because of the continued instability of Russia in the Eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has worsened considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting so that the tensions are not exacerbated.
As long as we are strong and as predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid a rising situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, President Donald Trump of the United States found that the US-Russia was even at a dangerously bad level.
Trump called on the countries to thank the poorly-friendly congress, which adopted the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko stops the relaunch against Anthony Joshua.
The long-term world champion Vladimir Klitshko ends his career.
The Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who hit gold in 1996 at the Olympics in Atlanta, fought 69 times as a professional and won 64.
He held various MM notes in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost his career in the last two fights.
Tyson Fury hit him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko encountered Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and disappeared after a vicious fight in the 11th edition.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet in the relaunch in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find motivation for the fight.
I was willing to use a few weeks to make a decision so that I could get enough distance to the Wembley game, Klitshko told me when he gave me the information.
I got everything I dreamed of as an amateur and professional fighter, and now I want to start my second career after a sport.
I could never have imagined I had such a long and incredible successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Look at Klitshko's reasons for his decision on the video.
Mr Bernd Bönte, the manager of Klitshko, said in the note that the decision to terminate Klitshko was difficult.
However, he has always stressed that he would want to stop if he had no more motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Mr Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating with the American actor Hayden Panttiere since 2009.
There is one child on the barrack, daughter of Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitshko's big brother, Vitali, is also the former world champion of the heavyweight series.
During 2008-12, the brothers controlled the MM statutes of the different unions at the same time.
In Finland, the weather thugs the circumstances: "Get out of the fiil"
The pork leaper Minna Nikkanen has suffered conditions during the summer's exterior period.
Minna Nikkassa has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken the woman out of the fiil.
Even insecure conditions exist in London's MM races.
Minna Nikkanen talks about savings.
The conditions have been this summer against Minna Nikka.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn't even get the little wings to move properly, Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've been competing and practicing here, knowing how many times, and I've never experienced the same volatile wind in this place, Nikkanen told me about Paavo Nurmin Games.
This period has been very difficult to standardize the jump when even the exercises have been so insecure winds, Nikkanen said in Kaleva’s races.
The weather was talking on Thursday in London.
It's been quite challenging to get the technology together, whether it's a cold shave or something.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken off the fence.
It doesn't make sense to consume energy in a bad situation.
He got into the MM race because of his 455 shrink.
It's been 445 out there.
The relationship in London isn't the same for everyone.
You have to be gentle and wait for better winds.
The aim is to exceed 460 on Friday.
Why don't you move to work abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer, I was in Italy and Germany from the beginning.
I've got a jump in a pile of tech and standardized.
I guess I should've done the same thing now.
Normally, it's gotten into the halls to practice, and now the hall has been closed.
How would I like to race?
25 degrees warm.
Even a little wind, as long as it's constant.
A experienced ex-official officer insulted politicians on Yle: "We have no room for distribution now and for many years."
Despite the positive climate of the economy, the government of Juha Sipilä must keep ice in the hat and warn against the increase of the government budget with debt money, warns the budgets prepared by Erkki Virtanen for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's nothing to share.
In 2015, Yle interviewed Virta, who lived on Wednesday at the One House.
The construction of the state budget for next year is about to start.
In recent times, the proposals of politicians, including the raising of a guarantee pension, the reduction of car tax and the support of electric bicycles, are considered to be election speeches.
They mainly say that the elections are starting to be close, because when 10% of the government budget is financed by additional debt, we have no room for distribution now or for many years.
I think it's even a deception to talk about a thief when it comes to debt, Virtanen said to Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debts owed to children.
The current has a long experience in preparing state budgets: in 1978, he started as a budget secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Section and Budget Manager.
Last time he retired, he was the head of office of the Ministry of Employment and Economic Affairs.
In Ylen’s interview, Virtanen pointed out that the current forecast economic growth of 3% is likely to be temporary.
All predictors estimate that this is a steak that will be left next year and Finland will be expected to grow by one per cent for decades.
Washington amends permanent residence permit rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of a permanent residence permit, Green Card, would be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, strengthen the requirements for temporary permits and restrict family visas.
The Republicans have proposed new rules and the President supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
The new search process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have the skills that are beneficial to our economy," Trump said in the media.
The wife of the Queen of Denmark doesn't want to be buried in the same place as the Queen.
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareteta.
In the picture of Prince Henrik and Queen Margarete as pictured in April.
Margarea, the Danish queen, 77, and her spouse Prince Henrik, 83, will not be buried next to her, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the ruler couples in Denmark have been buried at the same place.
The King's House has announced today that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Church, the court states in his announcement on Thursday.
According to the BT magazine, the reason for this is that the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the king's family.
There is no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his roles and titles in the Danish monarchy, Lene Belleby, head of the court communications, commented in the magazine.
The prince’s decision not to be buried alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated equally with his wife.
According to the Court, the queen has long been aware of the desire of her husband’s funeral and understands the decision.
The nightmare on the road: The car was to come on the highway.
Tom had an acquaintance on the ride and two little children.
They didn't get hurt in an accident, but they don't get money from the insurance if the other party is not targeted.
There was a crash at the Keimolan gate in Vantaa.
Archive picture of the building site of Kää III.
The Vantaan Tommi tells his family survived on Tuesdays by a miracle store in a car accident.
Tommi, his parole, Riina, and the two small children of the couple were driving on the highway at the Keimolan port in the direction of Hämeenlinna on Vantaa.
From joining the III circle to the Hämeenlinna road, a white car was driven to the side of the family's car, Tommi says.
Without an excitement, the car would have come with Tom.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it left hand, Tommi tells me.
The family car came up with a hard drive to the alley.
The parents and the two little children on the back seat didn't get hurt.
One of the children is slightly less than 3 years old, one is less than one year old.
Apparently, it was pretty lucky when nothing happened to us.
No one who passed was driving even towards us, even though there was a busy traffic in the place.
The accident happened around 5:20.
Tom says no one stopped at them, and the family called the emergency center.
They got out of the car by their own power.
The staff of the ambulance and rescue facility came in, and the family’s condition was checked.
The car went to reconstruction.
Tommi tells him and his single partner that they had small incomes, and they received family aid for buying a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family won't get the money from the insurance.
That is why the family hopes that the eyewitnesses would see the car that led the family to the chassis.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take the kids to the barn and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was white, old-fashioned car.
It was probably from the end of the 1990s or from the beginning of the 21st century.
He thought the car's license number was the beginning of the SIG.
If we don't get caught, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're gonna have to count every cent now.
Tommi hopes that what has happened is connected to the police.
The Eastern Newland Police Department and the Central New World Rescue Facility confirm that they have had a mission on Tuesday night at an accident site.
The headline and case was corrected at 21.15: Unlike the case originally mentioned, the other car did not come to Tom's side, but was driven from the speedband to the side of the family's car.
The show guided by Lotta Pöppinen deals with human relationships through humor - The self-evident will be seen at what? theater on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jöppinen, from the harbour, brings her first baby guides to what? theater.
The self - identifier is a music theatre show of past relationships and inadequacy.
But according to the director Lotta Puppise, it's still going to be a good idea.
The subject is dealt with by humor.
You don't have to be obsessed with old feelings, he says.
The circular summer theatre has been carried out according to Puppisinen, with a large, young heart and a peppery budget.
The name of the performance challenges you to consider what a person reveals when you get to know a new person.
Does he perhaps play a role, or is another coat nearly open?
An infinite presentation mixes fact and fiction
It's both controlled and dramatized the performance.
He's also responsible for the lights.
The proposal consists of the texts of the working group and does not have a plan.
The director believes that even though the presentation is exhausting the minds of young people, it talks about all ages.
It should be stressed that the self-consciouser does not tell directly about his or the working group's relationships.
Fact and fiction mix.
I'm sure my own world of value will be forwarded to the show.
I do not think that human relations would be bad, but neither would the relationship, especially the relationship, be a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the self-declarant draws a topical picture of young adults living in Finland, 100 years of age.
According to him, many have learned much about relationships with their parents, many of whom have been divorced.
At least you need to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance is played by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The group also includes the costume Ella Snellman.
The reconciliation of music is Jäppinen and Roka.
Love for the theater was on fire in Kouvola
Lotta Jöppinen, 26 from Kouvola, studyes theatre expression as director at the University of Applied Sciences at Turku University of Applied Sciences.
There's two years behind it, and there's another mess in front of you.
The enthusiasm to the theater has begun over the years of Kouvola.
The faculty of musical classes has been a assistant at Kouvola's theatre and has played, among other things, at the University Theatre in Helsinki and the last time at the City Theatre in Turku.
The management has become more and more interesting.
Last week, the self-detector got his first night at the Narrri's scene in Helsinki.
A performance of about 45 minutes has also been seen in the future at least in the City of Peppin in Turku.
Self-detectionist Kouvolan What? at the 4.8. at 19 and 5.8 p.m. at 14 and 19 p.m.
A Finnish Olympic winner recovered for a year from a terrible motocrossonence, a necklace broke
In Finland, few athletes have the same uninterrupted natural power as Janne Lahtela.
For a hundred days a year, the coupling acquaintance circulated the world for 20 years and pursued his dream of the Olympic Gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtela movement continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also an experimentor of new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that the chemical breeder would not have tried at least once.
It's been an enthusiasm to practice.
There's always something new.
Finally, one hobby was to stop the Bay completely.
In 2014, Lahtala had a motocross accident.
As a result, his necklace and both hands broke.
I didn't work at all.
I've been sniffing wounds at my house for a year, says Lahtela.
The gift had bad luck.
He also admits that the age could have had a share in decay.
You know, driving a bike can sound like a hell of a bitch.
But I didn't get the limits.
It's just so hard as a species, that it's worth not too much for a 40-year-old!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind it was a long run as the head coach of the Japanese freestyle country team.
Lahtela started on the peseta immediately after the end of its career in 2006.
For the first time after I was 15 years old, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much, the bayla tells me.
During the training period, the Gulf often challenged its protector in front and physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired that my own thoughts seemed unreasonable.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be there.
I actually enjoyed it because I really just had to be once.
The compulsory break was enthusiastic for the head coach of the Lahtula Finland.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'd burned out.
It's easier to find places that have gone apart than intact!
Without an accident, I wouldn't have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtala started the Finnish freestyle country team as coach about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the wagons.
I switched the motocross to frisbeegolph!
I mean, it just left the lamb right now.
At the worst, I was seven hours a day throwing.
Although Láhtala has always been a super-intelligent trainer, he does not require those who train him to be the same as him.
I'm not gonna force everyone to do the same.
Our species culture has the opportunity to be their own and to become the best of the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been in line with it, says Lahtela.
The sex robots come and we should be worried.
It is here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot sector – just after it had started to feel that 2017 can no longer become stranger.
Yes, I do.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within the next 5-10 years.
"We must start to take seriously the spread of sex robots," says Professor Noel Sharkey of Emeritus at the University of Sheffield, founder and robotics and artificial intelligence.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Seksirobots are used, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see them even more," said Sharkey at the release conference.
Sexuques have evolved from breathing dolls to robots with a warm-looking silicone skin and features created by artificial intelligence, which remind people of their use.
The user can also adapt the robot to its own preferences from the colour of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of fingernails.
The more worrying thing is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like advanced freedom players.
Sexukus has evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the nature of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, even as shy.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventure-like and so on.
"Roxxy Gold's personality is as fully as possible adapted to the user's personality," the company's website is advertised.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has a variety of moods:
It may be tired, like, a conversation mood, or a "she's in a mood."
There are many worrying features in the spreading of sex robots, which replace real human relations, but even more dangerously, the subjection of women and direct rape fantasy when the user approaches, for example, a robot programmed for shyness and opposition.
True Companion compares Roxxy robot with the vibrator:
"Women have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
However, sex robots are not just fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
The generalisation and development of them is about something more dark and deeper in our culture: a decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where undermining is one of the options among others.
Of course, the majority of men do not acquire sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
Marginal phenomena, however, tell a lot about the life of time.
And many start acting strangely or insulting only when the market permits it.
It is not a coincidence that sex robots have started to become common at the same time as women's rights are threatened across the world, and a president sitting in the White House who has been convincing to harass women.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Orjathares) is not the most worrying of its powerful image language, such as pictures of the hanged body and out of the eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but it seems that right now there is a surprising short journey.
Sex robots are attempted to do as much as possible for real women (by the scales of porn stars) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and their movements imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history — not any implication of independence or a violation of the fantasy of perfect surrender.
They're pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspects: Two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, head of Isisi
The Head of the Border Organisation, Isisi, led a group of Australian men suspected of taking the bomb to the Etihad Airways airplane.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person who was headed by Isis had also sent a bomb to Sydney.
According to suspects, the bomb was intended to be taken into a plane on July 15, but the company interrupted before the security inspection.
The police won't tell me exactly why the company broke down.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a device for the release of toxic colourless gas and to take the device to a spotful public place, such as a public transport device.
Michael Phelan, Federal Deputy Commissioner for Australia, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans that have ever been made in Australia.
Because of the terrorist plans of the suspects, four men were captured in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews will continue.
The good sides of the trump?
Make Mitt Romney appear to be a legacy of sound sense.
During the Trump period, it has already been said to bored that a strong two-year-old voter has also broken down families.
On Christmas and Thanksgiving’s roads, American newspaper counseling boards taught how to deal with the family members of the Troms voted.
We all want to break our information bubbles.
Less attention has been given to the ability of Trump to unite families.
I'll tell you about this because my cousin visited me in New York this week, and he's a left-minded poet in Chicago, who's been on the other side of our family Republicans for a long time.
He reminded that a common enemy can have a powerful uniting effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousin is all known, including the Republicans' supportive sister, with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades, suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
It is a good thing at the dinner table, but, more widely, there are significant risks.
Trump has given the Left a new power, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalisation", we're talking about the scary possibility that one day we will never be able to horror his tricks.
In the long term, there is an even more scary possibility that Trump will normalise the right edge of the Republicans, which suddenly seem to be quite reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember the slow version of the madness of Mitt Romney: the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (and, at least, we have seen his tax declaration). Compared to the trumps, they seem very mild.
Once Trump's season is over, the next presidential candidate of the Republicans must be only clear, and it seems to be an outstanding improvement immediately.
When my cousin was going to visit me, we took our child to the Central Park carousel, the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best that we can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The horses of the carussell are huge, in the middle of the figures — gracious clowns and horror - looking animals — and the music behind the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York’s characteristics are becoming disappointed over time: the prospects of high buildings are getting bored, the city’s silhouette become too familiar and the reality of the city is not the same as dreams.
And I still, after 35 years, have gone completely beyond the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cabin, but a large transport circle in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss spirit pub, but it is not calculated.
Instead, the carousel in the Central Park is still a strange magic experience — even to the extent that two two - year - olds, one - eleven - year - old and two - 40 - year - old women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel full points if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately, no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked this week at the warehouse to evaluate my "pay experience" in a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on the counting device.
The same thing in the cafe with my home corners, but I am also given the opportunity to combine a 15% service allowance when I go to the coffee dish myself.
This slows down the interaction and pressures the customer server to put his person in a game in a situation where it is not needed.
The saleswoman smiled sadly when I was tired of giving my credit card five stars to use experience.
Shefki Kuqi got fired from Inter, "I didn't have the leadership's trust"
FC Inter has been released today by Shefki Kuq's company for the mission team coaches.
The training responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccare, who was formerly a coach.
The other training team will continue its current tasks.
Piccareta, a Italian, has previously been a co-coach, among other things, in Sunderland, England.
In January, Piccareta, a 51-year-old member of the Inter Training Group, has completed the UEFA Pro licence last year.
Mr Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the FC Interi Board, regretted what happened.
Changing a coach is never a easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq had no longer the trust in the management of the company, when there was no other option, Håkans commented in the report.
The Piccareta Agreement shall be valid until the end of the period.
He is already responsible for tomorrow's home fight against the HIFK with the other training team.
According to the news of the evening-words, the team has been drowning on Thursdays.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that I was following the assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have moved away.
Kuqi and Piccareta strongly joined the Inter in the fight against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a picture of her youth from the '80s, would you identify a serious violin student?
The violin artist Linda Lampenius published a youth picture in Instagram.
There have been several hamsters added to the picture, which suggests that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius himself wonders a young woman looking at a serious camera.
A long time ago, serious, he's texting.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful issues.
A fair year ago, he published a picture of himself in Instagram.
In the second picture, he's been seen 20 years ago, and in the other, he poses now, as a mother of two children.
In his picture text, Lampenius reflects his own growth as a human and refers to eating problems that he suffered when he was younger.
Just 20 years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, confidence, self-esteem, love of himself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his meals in the past.
She was already 14 years old in the hospital for her anorexia and orthonasia.
A little later, he also became ill with his bulimia, which eventually became revealed only in 2006.
The healing started slowly.
In addition to the therapy and comparison, Lampenius helped a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital care for the cuts on his wrists, which he, according to the prison authorities, had fallen in a cell.
Pistorius was sentenced to murder for the original murder sentence of the prosecutors.
He killed Steenkamp's Valentine's Day in early hours in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder who was hiding in the bathroom.
The prosecutors have told us they're going to complain again because they consider the sentence of Pistorius for six years too light.
The Kingdom Prosecutor intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the complaint will be dealt with in any case this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of Pistorius may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not available in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two unlawfully camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported according to the BTV channel.
The police arrested a bunch of unauthorized camped people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, with two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation will continue.
According to the TV channel BTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that they had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping areas and already give considerable fines to all who are camping outside the areas not intended for purpose.
The checks shall be continued until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the right to impose a fine may be imposed.
Liquid stock sinks - rising already -7.7%
The shares of the oil refiner Nesteen have fallen by 7.7 per cent around 11 a.m.
The result of it fell before taxes, but it crossed the projection of Inquiry Financial.
The stock exchange has started today in a lightly free way, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
After the opening of the stock exchanges, the large European Stoxxx 600 index was 0.2 per cent.
The Helsinki Stock Exchange General Index OMXH had dropped 0,3 per cent to 9509.48 points after about half an hour of trade and OMXH25 had lost 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange of stock was EUR 41 million, of which nine million were the result reporter of the morning.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritated bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like an appetite in the digestive system.
However, a recent study suggests the opposite: a diet containing a high amount of meat protein and dairy products may facilitate the irritated bowel syndrome.
An unhealthy intestinal syndrome is an unhealthy disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in Britain. It causes abdominal cramps, swelling, recurring or bleeding diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers from Washington University found that the necessary amino acid stryptophane in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen the intestinal tolerability.
According to the research director Marco Colonna, the immune cells are guarding the spleen and making sure that no harmful microbes can get into the body in the food.
Cells that balance infections, which strengthen the ability to tolerate, protect the body without damage to sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too close to inflammation, the result may be the irritated intestinal syndrome.
Studies have shown that there are immune cells that are tolerable in mice with a certain bacteria in the intestine.
This bacteria needs tryptophane so that the immune cells start to appear, and tryptophan is one of the protein building materials.
"We found a link between Lactobacillus reuter and the development of tolerance-producing cells. Lactobacillus reuter is part of the normal intestinal microbiology," says Professor Colonna.
"The more tryptophane in the muizen's diet, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuter and a high-acting tryptophane diet can strengthen the intestinal tolerability and reduce the sensitivity to inflammation.
In examining the immune cells that were tolerable, Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one mouse group had such cells, they were not present in mice of the same species that were considered separately from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbials of mice, i.e. to the normal association of gastrointestinal bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When the intestinal DNA of mice was studied, six bacterial species were observed in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteric bacteria were administered to mice who had no intestinal microbimals and who did not develop immune cells in a sterile environment, immune cells began to develop.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system, which raised Lactobacillus reuterials in the liquid and transferred small volumes of liquids — without bacteria — to unaccompanied immune cells from mice.
Immune cells developed into tolerable cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be an adjuvant to Tryptophan’s metabolism, known as indol-3-milk acid.
When researchers doubled the number of kryptophan in mice, the number of cells tolerating tolerance increased by approximately 50%.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, man has the same tolerable cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuterial bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not yet known whether the Lactobacillus reuteroids of Tryptophan's by-products allow the cells to develop in humans the same way as in mice. However, genetic errors associated with Tryptophan have been observed in patients with a prophylactic intestinal syndrome.
"We probably want to contribute to the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation in the intestines," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High Tryptophane levels in combination with Lactobacillus reuter bacteria may contribute to their exacerbation."
Jose Mourino thought that Manchester United had a "neron" agreement with Nemanja Mathi in its rows.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United received a "nero" agreement with Nemanja Mathi in its rows. Midfield player debuted in Manchester United's rows on Wednesday night against Sampdoria.
With 40 million pounds from Chelsea, Matic started to win 2-1 in Dublin, in the final game of the United, before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He was an impressive middle field player against stars like Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best condition yet, because he was not involved in the cruise of the blue shirts in Asia before the beginning of the season. He only took 45 minutes on the field – according to Mourino, a change must be made before the beginning of the eloliiga season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his thinking makes him a genius – he has natural thinking ability for football," says Morinho.
"We'll help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, the entrants Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting the game at Aviva Stadium, when Maurino started to slice their start-up for the beginning of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the company has already done a "good job" by getting three of his four priority players.
"Three out of four: I have to thank the company," he added.
"I'm more pleased if I get all four, but they did excellent work."
Airball women were bullying Germany for two rounds.
The Finnish Women's Airball Team lost its fourth match for the World Cup tour in Germany directly from 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German routine level is high.
Their fair game was in every sector, Finland's main coach Tapio Kangasniemi reported in the newsletter.
In the first two rounds, Finland held its opponents at a tight edge, but Germany was clearly stronger in the third batch.
Germany runs the section.
When we were played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to play with it, Kangasniemi said.
The most effective in Finland was 14 points collected by Pia Korhonen.
Three of the four fights lost by Finland will meet Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The Grand Jury has already sent challenges in connection with Trump Jr's meeting in Russia
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges in connection with Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya meeting.
The great jury called to see Robert Mueller has already challenged Donald Trump Jr and the Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, known as the Kremlin link.
The news agency Reuters, who, at the same time, confirms the invitation of the large jury of the Wall Street Journal previously revealed on Thursday.
According to Reuters, the great jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting of the Veselnitskaya, known as Trump Jr and Kreml, which was held during the presidential elections in the United States in June 2016.
There were also the campaign manager of Donald Trump Sr, Paul Manafort, and his nephew Jared Kushner, the current advisor of the White House.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Attorney Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington means a tightening of Russia's research.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a large jury to help with the investigation, which seeks to find out Russia's involvement in the presidential elections in the United States and whether Trump's campaign or cooperation with his neighbourhood in the matter with Russia.
The grand jury expands Mueller’s rights to collect evidence, send challenges and force people to testify on a jury basis.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
A large jury will consider the evidence from the prosecutor's investigation and decide whether the case should be prosecuted.
The British inventor was a microchip to get home and into his car with a hand wheezing.
The British inventor is the first person in the whole country with a microchip of himself, so that he can open his home outside door, get into his office and start his car with a hand flush.
The microchip is between the 33-year-old Steven Northam thumb and the front finger. Now he offers a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam BioTeq technology.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson, a surgeon doctor consulting the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hans, so that the microchip installation meets medical requirements.
The microchips use the same technology as cats and dogs in microchips, and it takes only 30 seconds to install it.
Northam also attempts to make the locks of houses and cars compatible with the microchip. One lock handling costs 300 pounds.
Northam is married, and he has one child, and he has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he lands his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibition cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The last month of the White House's decision to fly a sailing helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House was to pay taxpayers $24,000.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the President is on its way. It was a tendency for an event held in the White House on 17 July 2017, which presented American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials were familiar with products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, the exhibitions included a sailboat from Maine, a fire car from Wisconsin and a trunk from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office had requested a helicopter with a task-specific order only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn for the "experienced" event. This is illustrated in the documentation of the HMX-1 helicopter fleet of the Navy.
"I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of this, because this is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an e-mail on the day before the event to his superior, a deputy commander of the Navy Air Force.
The message reported that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn at 17.7. 7:00 a.m., and the event would begin at three afternoons. The helicopter would only leave the place after emptying the lawn in the evening between 6:00 and 9.
In addition, the message noted that if the departure of the helicopter from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be needed because of the limitation of the periods of service.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
Documents received by the TIME magazine are not clear whether a second crew was finally needed.
The United States Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the papers, HMX-1 asked for a breach of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were told not to be broken," wrote the commander.
"It sounds like you can participate," the assistant commandant responded.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even the official events have political tones.
At the meeting, the President spoke in favour of the reform of health care and less stringent state regulation at that time in the Senate.
The use of Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them on their trips,
but their use for photographs only is unusual.
Trump’s actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of the president’s campaign event in Melbourne in the state of Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor’s presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with Made in America, which presented products made from American materials made by American workers from all 50 states," said the White House press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews regularly carry out training flights in the DC area and practise the introduction of a president in the southern lawn at a centimeter in the White House.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 rehearsals for the White House.
According to one official, the flights to Made in America included a monthly training quota for the crew.
The helicopters of the unit also had 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential missions".
According to the White House, the event did not cost taxpayers any other costs.
Sikorsky's reporter told me that the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter presentation in the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have a record of flights related to the President’s duties, and a precise assessment of the costs of the event is difficult.
According to VH-3D helicopter compensation from the Ministry of Defence for 2017, the compensation rate is EUR 24 380 per hour.
According to HMX-1's records, flights from Quantico's base to the White House from the state of Virginia and back in total took an hour.
According to the White House, the helicopter's operating costs are clearly lower.
"The calculation of the cost of the taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," says Walters.
"The appropriate level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called ‘adjusted’ costs that are taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the RAND Research Company’s report in 2015, the level of compensation does not include staff costs, but takes into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, Sean Spicer, former press secretary of the White House defended the use of a helicopter in the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," said Spicer.
"I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and thus employing hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defence equipment that many Americans have worked hard before.
It is absolutely appropriate to raise that."
It's not sure if Trump went to the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat in the car driver's seat.
In the White House, Trump made a joke to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three."
The lightning hit the Vaasan track, the trains have to be replaced by buses.
Traffic traffic between the wall river and Vaasa is broken because of technical defects, reported by the Rail Transport Centre.

The Venezuelan State Attorney General demands the right to prevent the new country's delegation.
The Venezuelan State Attorney General has requested a court decision which would prevent the appointment of a new country's delegation.
President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela has announced that the delegation chosen in the vote last Sunday would be appointed on Friday.
In the contested vote, a delegation was elected to the country, which, among other things, could change the country's constitution.
According to Prime Minister Luisa Ortega, the decision to prevent is requested because of electoral suspicions.
Ortega has also started a election trial.
He appointed two judges to the mission after the British company which held the vote in the delegation said that the results were manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about a million higher than the actual number of voters.
Only Maduro’s allies were subjected to the representation, and the selected 545 members of the delegation have the son and wife of Maduro, among other things.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the delegation may dismantle the Congress leading the opposition and change the laws.
Maduro as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition believes that the constitution should be modified as a means of strengthening Maduro's position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
In turn, the European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they do not recognise the new delegation.
Maduro claims that the new delegation is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
There have been months of unrest in Venezuela.
Many people have been wounded in them, and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela fell into a financial crisis after the price of oil fell.
Now many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to show its mind on Friday, when the new delegation is to start.
A Russian man delivered by Finland was sentenced to a prison of 4 years in the United States
The Minneapolis court in the United States sentenced the 41 - year - old Maxim Senah for about four years from the involvement of prisoners in the global computer warrior.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of the claim made by the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
In February 2016, Finland delivered Senah to the US judicial authorities despite Russian protests, reports AFP.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had gained the benefits of millions of dollars.
Senah received 46 months of imprisonment.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be expelled from the country after the sentence of imprisonment.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs congratulated Finland hardly after the arrest and said that he should not be handed over to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused of being arrested in Finland without the fact that Russia knew it in advance.
According to the prosecution, Senah had been using a computer virus called Ebury, which grabbed dozens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish user names and passwords.
After that, cheaters used the information by continuing to control Internet traffic, which was used to make click-outs and distribute spam.
According to the Director of the Ministry of Justice, Kenneth Blanco, the case shows that the United States is capable of chasing other active Cyber criminals.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told us in the newsletter.

Kari Kola performs an exceptional light art work in Paris
The Joensuari luminous artist Kari Kola (Kuwsa) performs an exceptional lighting work to honor the first day of the light set by the United Nations next year in Paris on 16 May.
Kola's doing a photon art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illustrates the Fontenoy building of Unesco's headquarters and the Globe monument on its side.
In my work, I want to emphasise not only the light but also the darkness.
Today, the luminous rate of millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can raise important things that I have experienced to be concretely visible, says light artist Kari Kola about his work.
I am very pleased with the invitation to be involved in the first international light day and bringing light art into the thematic day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was involved in the opening of the Light Year in 2015, when he illuminated the Unesco headquarters to celebrate the celebration.
I feel very privileged when I get to perform my art again at the Unesco headquarters, Kari Kola tells me.
The work may still be substantially extended.
We'll inform you about this later in the fall, and Kola will continue.
The aim of the International Light Day is to highlight the importance of light for mankind and to raise people's awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first day of the light will be celebrated at the Unesco headquarters in the centre of Paris on 16 May.

Timo Soin's article entitled "Now the Flood"
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog paper on Thursday, which is labelled with a question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences.
In my day, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven representatives to the Government Party.
After that, the flood came, now it's all floating, Soini writes.
Soin's text contains references to France of the 17th century.
It is known that King Ludvig XV or his mistress, Madame de Pomadour, has used a flood comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, the books of history have left a revelation of "the flood after us" or "the flood after me".
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
Elections are only representative if they can vote for all members of society, including women, said the head of the UN delegation in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicolas Haysom, the provisional leader of the UN Assistance Mission, stated that hundreds of women are subject to elections in the province councils, three women are seeking vice president and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be too much emphasised," said Haysom in his opinion on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan province council and presidential elections will be held on 5.4.2017.
The Taliban has put forward threats to the elections at the same time as international troops are moving to advisory role.
The elections of this year will be the first time that power moves peacefully from a democratically elected government to another.
Mr Haysom said that women's contribution to strengthening Afghanistan's democracy.
According to the Afghan independent electoral committee, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The flood of certain tourists threatens the culture of the region
The authorities consider limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly targeted by the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: we only have a few hours at the target and we are going to run through the large crowds of attractions.
Venice has a quick day trip to tourists in the city.
Cape streets are difficult to move, and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the people of Venice will no longer be able to join.
They have been forced to move away from the historical center, while hotels have come to their place.
The New York Times and The Guardians wrote about the problems of tourism in Venice.
Authorities consider restrictions on tourists.
They call the present phenomenon a bad-quality tourism - low-quality touristism.
When a large cruise ship arrives, time is given for two or three hours.
You follow the flag guide from Piazza to the Romata Rialto Bridge and the St. Mark's market, and you turn back, describes the current and problematic tourism of the Italian Minister of Culture, Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the work of a place, shops and workshops.
We must maintain this part of the identity of cities.
Saint Mark's tour also belongs to the most popular visits of the historic center of Venice.
The Church of St. Markus is located on the side of Tor.
The local rage is also mainly on cruise ships.
There are no more 50 000 locals living in the historic center of Venice.
In 1951, there were about 175 000 inhabitants.
In July, estimated 2,000 Venetians expressed their minds against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was in the process of the demonstration.
The equation is difficult because the ships bring the hardly needed income to Venice and create the need for a number of jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is that cruisers should go further from the historical center.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, would be sure to change the situation if the administrative territory of Venetia, where Venetian is located, would have more power to decide on its own affairs - if not complete autonomy.
There are about 20 to 30 million tourists every year in Venice.
Are you driving in Kuopio?
On the motorway, bad cylinders of a distance of km
On the highway between Kuopio and Siil Lake, on the north side of the strip has been miles away from the work on Thursday afternoon during return transport.
There is a highway coating work in the area that slows the traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
In the case of sciences, there is a limit of 50 kilometres per hour instead of a normal 120 km per hour.
However, even in a restricted area of 50 kilometres, traffic had been moving on Thursday afternoon in practice.
On Thursday afternoon, the roadworks proceeded on the side of the Silin Lake in the field of Revelation, or the golden cave.
I'll be fine without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has been forced to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published beautiful pictures of himself in the landscape of Grand Canyon, among other things.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-Norwegian, has risen in its current country in Norway as a popular athlete, not least because he broke a 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-metre run by turning around 51.81.
A month later, he improved a 400 - yard fence at the time of the Norwegian record of 55.38.
Shortly after his record, Iuel, a hardly using social media, was able to notice that celebrity and publicity had a shadow side.
Men around the world began to send to Iuel pictures of their sex organs in the hope that a young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel had to close his Snapchat account from outside.
I got a lot of "bricks" from strangers, so I had to turn my account privately, and Iuel told the VG magazine.
In the interview with the VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he received.
I'm sure you can guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'm good at it without such a different kind of attention.
Iuel was born in 1994 in Denmark.
His mother is Danish, Father Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel’s family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12-year-old, a family moved to Namibia first, then to Pakistan for the work of his father.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were in turn.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship for Norwegian nationality.
In Norway, Iuel is practicing three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Steltum.
Norway is much more open to discussing than in the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask anything but give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to have personal relations with the athlete, Iuel said to the VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian recordings at 400 metres and 400 metres.
The snowboarder Janne Korve took the whole career on the stake now in the MM race, "It's nice when it doesn't happen"
It's been nice to count when nothing happened!
Janne Korpi, 31 of Finland’s most successful snowboarders, has been able to enjoy their beloved species again this season.
Last summer, the future of the career was at stake.
The burden damage of the footboard had forced Corve to the cutting table in January, and the leg did not want to heal.
The hand had taken a hit in the caterpillar road too.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was doing, whether the boarding was going on or not.
Sponsoridiles were disrupted and many things were open, Corp says.
But that's what they say, it's the way things are arranged.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw back into the chest.
After that, it was easy to decide.
I knew it at the latest when I first went to snow.
I was gonna be damned, but this is so funny again, we're gonna pull over a couple more.
The raven had to count properly until September-October, but after a long break, it's been a big deal to train as painless.
There's only a few races around Korp.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Corvelle.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to target four years for one race, and then you'll be hot for that week.
I can't think that, Corp says.
Today, Korp is rivaling in the baseball of the world races held in Sierra Nevada in Spain.
Even though individual races don't keep him on board, he's always on fire when he fights hard.
According to the ear, the value of the races organised by the International Ship Association has increased over the past few years, although some of the boarders chose Norway X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is big.
However, in my view, appreciation always depends on the conditions and the level of the races.
Corp is the oldest at 12-spirit Finnish team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's clusters, Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkinenniemi are 14 years younger.
It's nice to watch younger friends go.
I remember when I was at the moment that everything was new and so sick and excited about everything.
It's bringing itself a new power. Korpi's thinking.
I'm still in the chest somehow, but no, that's the amount of power I've got in my friends!
In the background of the boarding career Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of the directorial legend Pekka Korve has been touched by a rheumatoid sport: a scout has his own rhythm horses to whom he is performing training programs.
When I'm on a trip all the time, there's no more time to be in the mess.
But every day I look at at at least the nutrient results, and usually something about leaving, Corpi tells me.
Treatment management and medical training are, according to Corve, a potential career plan when the boarding career is completed.
I don't think I'm planning that far, but it's at least a likely alternative.
I'm gonna try it a little, like I'm studying it here with snowboarding.
I'm trying to stay on the nerves of time and develop, maybe in the summer, there's something going on.
If it's my future profession, then it's not hard to start when it's already in the species.
The raviations include the Elitloppet Raviation with the competitor Jaajo Linnoma.
The twin has rented a cruise ship that is headed to Stockholm at the end of May to the Elithloppet Race.
Corp and Linnonmaa decided to relive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone well, and people have been enthusiastic.
We're already at the point that at least there will be no bankruptcy.
A few months is still time, hopefully we get the ship filled, Korpi says excited.
Attendo's nursery home project for Krite has surprised all of them.
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new nursery for ages of 41 that are built for Kite.
For next summer, the construction of a large of 1,700 layers of water is due to be completed on the other side of the health centre’s neighbouring health centre.
With crystalline general wondering the subject of which the new treatment unit is sufficient for customers, as many private care homes are now winning customer shortages during the Siu wars.
Anne Flink Attendo, Regional Director of Maintenance Services, commented that Kite will have more demand in the future not only for options but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, the freedom of choice works better, says Flink.
Attendo bought private care homes from Kite last year in Kanervikkola and Erika.
The trade involved business, but there is known to be a five-year lease on real estate.
Flink says Attendo does not have an acute need to move the activities out of these premises.
More about this later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand plant in Scotland
The trade union seeks from the directors of the McVitie's maker to confirm its long-term commitment to production at Glasgow factory.
According to the GMB Department of the United Kingdom General Trade Union, the company has not informed about its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
There are more than 500 employees in a factory producing Hobnobs and Rich Tea and other products.
Pladis, a company owning McVitie's Brenda, reported that he invested in the factory over five million pounds in the last few years.
The company added that workers and trade union representatives should be "provided first" if there is a change in their activities.
In its letter to the Executive Director, GMB calls on the company to "respect that no funding has been allocated to the modernisation of production lines".
Drew Duffy of the GMB Trade Union considers it very worrying that there is no clear information from the manufacturer about the needs of Tollcross' business and future investment plans.
"Familys have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has been strongly focused on the local community and the large town area of Glasgow, and the factory is a major worker in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and income, as well as of the rising cost of living and continuous reduction of production, the Eastern Glasgow needs a prosperous McVitie's production.'
According to Pladis’s informant, the company had only received a letter from the trade union on the day before, and the company directly responds to the letter because it appreciates continuous interaction with the employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with workers and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed several issues openly.
We discussed with workers, among other things, that, like other highly competitive and unsure companies, we are constantly assessing all our business and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the informant, the company has invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross factory in recent years, particularly in its production lines and in improving its operation.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production plant, and we will certainly tell the first workers and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the activity of the factory."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
Laliga may regret her interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's pursuit after paying for the closure of the EUR 189 million transfer agreement, but did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago?
Sensational transfer is the most mentioned event in the summer. The French League 1 football team is ready to break the world record of colonies. The previous record was less than half lower: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a sum of 89 million pounds of transfer.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive football player and also the world's most hired professional athlete, as the PSG offers him over 500 000 pounds of weekly salary after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious about the activities of the PSG and the way Neymar has left the crowd. A source close to Barcelona tells us that the company has taken great care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of the PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matud in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelafi warned the best players in the PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they seek our players, we will become their opponent and we will contact their players," Al-Khelafi said.
"Thanks for all the sculptures.
But if they seek our players, they will face the consequences."
It seems that Barcelona was guilty of this: it expressed interest in the middle-field player of the PSG in Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will therefore lose its star Neymar.

The calls from Trump were invented by the White House reporter, "I wouldn't say it was a lie."
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by the President Donald Trump of the United States never happened, reports the New York Times.
Calls made by Trump with both the president of Mexico and the director of the patrol organization have proved to be invented.
The White House reporter Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said Trump didn't lie.
According to Sanders, many of the patrol leaders spoke to Trump personally, and with President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico Trump had discussed at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty bad accusation.
These discussions took place, they didn't just happen on the phone, but facelessly, Sanders justified.
The speech to the patrols woke up the worse.
Trump told me on Monday that the president of Mexico called him and commended Trump for the success of the illegal migration.
According to the Trump, Pena Nieto said that few would come over the southern border of Mexico, because they know that the journey would be crossing the US border anyway.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government published a press release saying that the call had not been made.
On Tuesday, Politico published a complete version of the interview with the Wall Street Journal.
That was where Trump illuminated his speech at a large meeting of the national patrol organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the patrol leader, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the patrol organization announced that it was not aware of the call of any leader to Trump.
According to the news, Michael Surbaugh's previous statement by the organization's director, where he had asked Trump to apologize to the patrols, speaks his side.
Trump’s speech at the patrol organization’s meeting was a great surprise because it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he glowed the results of the last autumn presidential elections.
