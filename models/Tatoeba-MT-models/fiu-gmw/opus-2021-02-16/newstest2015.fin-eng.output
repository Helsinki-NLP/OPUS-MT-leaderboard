The town of Juankosske is connected to the city of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The Coupio City Council unanimously approved the Association on Monday.
The City Council of Juankoske accepted the connection last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the investigation of the municipality, but its delegation decided that Tuusniemi would continue independently.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide separately to implement the following municipalities.
The municipal elections will be held next time in 2016.
After the accession of Juankosske, the population of Kuopio is about 111 000.

India has also been said to be interested in the defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukraine's troops shoot civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the leadership of Kiev of refusing direct political discussions with the Separatists of Eastern Ukraine.
At this moment, the Kiova leadership does not want to conduct an in-depth political debate with the eastern part of its country, and Putin said that the news agency Itar-Tassi was doing so.
He also said that the Russian-minded separatists, who say Kiev and the West are assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukraine's troops away from their present spots where Putin said that the Ukrainian army would shoot civilians.
The goal of militia fighters is to push out these armed forces and their artifacts so that they do not get the chance to shoot the residents of the region, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrm repair plant.
It was a surprise that the people came from the very beginning of the night.
There were visitors in two days to be expected, Promotor Tom Kangas tells us.
The Wall River Hiphop Festival was organised for the third time.
Next year again.
We're still going to be hiphop festivals, so no pop is allowed, Kangas convincing.
On Tuesday, Finland will enter into force by law restricting the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals must apply for permission from the Police Government to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as explosives.
These substances include hydrogen perchlorate, nitromethane, nitrogenic acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing these substances if the concentrations are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is found in cleaning and washing substances, but concentrations in these are generally not exceeding the limit values.
Nitromethane, for example, is used in a speeding drive.
However, prior to the entry into force of the law, the materials obtained may be kept and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster is charged with hotel rapes from Nairn and Pitlochry
Two of the rapists in the hotel await a trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at the sitting of the High Court of Glasgow.
He is charged with rape at the Pitlochryn Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman in this "being in unconscious state, sleeping, and being so incapable of making a decision by itself".
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, the Upper Land, on 4 May 2014.
In accordance with the decision of the Judge, Lady Rae, the trial will be held in Edinburgh at the Court of Justice of the Supreme Court on 17 November.
Valoligijai: Super Raheem gloomed - Mario remained in the shadow - Valoligii - Alta-Sanomat
Raheem Sterling, just 19 years old, showed again why he was regarded as the hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere on Sunday when the strengthened Liverpool arrived to Tottenham.
The first performance of Super Mario was promising: experienced English editors saw a 24 - year - old Italian work on the field with a different attitude than in Manchester City.
The ballotelli was still far away from the top.
The Italian lost three high-quality destinations and fed only half of his six meals to his own team.
The Pools who have already taken their favourites will wait for a better one in the future.
The Liverpool Manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli on his trip to Barcelona to the role of Luis Suarez as the second attacker along with Daniel Sturridge.
As the team's sterling, instead of Balotelli, Raheem Sterling was the tip of the middle field, who threw a 3-0 victory over the important opening paint by Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, it's not just your power to glow.
The Englishman is 20 cents shorter than the fish in the water between the opponent's lines.
The identity is not common to a player who runs around 34 km per hour with the lawn at its best.
Rodgers also deserves great thanks for Sterling's development.
After the fight, the Northern Irelander told me how Liverpool has systematically developed a more universal player from the Northwest Lonely chair on the foot of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was elected to be the headmaster of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The City Board of Helsinki has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin as the next major champion of the Helsinki City Orchestra since autumn 2016.
The newspapers, along with the Los Angeles Times, have asked what orchestra he's taking next.
Susanna Mälkki says that she will start her new assignment with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a key role in the musical life of our country for over a hundred years, including by displaying a large number of Sibelius music.
The Orchestra has been led by the best Finnish chapel champions and I have worked with many members of the Orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation," he says.
Governments of employees' organisations gather on pension negotiation - Home - Regions - News - Karjalainen
Today, there is a new pace for pension negotiations on social organisations' own meetings.
The administrations of the SAK, the Aka and the STTK will deal with the negotiating situation in the morning.
Since then, the actual pension negotiations are to be continued.
The labour market organisations have, among other things, been scattered by the debate on the binding of retirement age to life expectancy.
The organizations have promised a work job solution by the autumn, but according to the latest estimates it would be created in the course of this week.
It's a buffalo.
The Rovaniely Women's Airball Gay team Woman Volley stumbled into the Galician and Vampulan Sports League at the training tournament final on Sunday.
The vampula twisted to five of the extended match 3-2.
The last batch of WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was a step ahead of us all the time.
The fight was good, but in the defence game and pass game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVon's sixteen was so crusty that a 190-century American censor Jennifer Keddy was stuck on the side of the back.
As a censor, Sara Niemi played.
In spite of his thumb injury, Karoliina Kyllönen was gambling and formed the most powerful combination of WoVo with Johanna Pekkarsen.
Jenna Centralmäki, who started the hacker, was able to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 lot.
The best part of the injury was a skilled Russian passer as well as a libero Hillaelinan, which WoVo drew as much as possible.
WoVo's preparation for the league will continue next weekend when the Hämeenlinna HPK comes to training camp for Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "shopper" at 6:00 a.m. in the official training game.
On Sunday, we'll meet at the sports college again.
Lidl tacks vicious figures in Finland
Turnover of Finnish sales to the company grew by almost 25 per cent during the end of February to almost EUR 1.2 billion.
The company published its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 shops in Finland, and enlargement is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that the last financial year paid almost EUR 14 million to Finland.
Lidl Finland belongs to the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4 200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more frequently killed due to delayed diagnosis and access to complicated treatment in poorly populated areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published a video as an honor for her mother who died of ovary cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas are at a higher risk of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
In 2005, more than 1100 Australian women who received ovary cancer diagnosis were examined by researchers and noted that only 35% of women, or more than five years after diagnosis.
Chief investigator Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in poorly populated and distant areas were more likely to die by 20% during the study than women living in urban areas.
RESEARCH: New medicines may slow lung and ovarian cancer
Scientists went through women's health history for seven years.
According to the doctor Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous illnesses and socio-economic status also affected the survival potential.
The probability of survival at the time of the diagnosis was low in older women and cancer.
Women living in rare and distant areas were more likely to die in the course of the study than women living in urban areas by 20%.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside cities have a lower chance of survival of ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers it possible for delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment.
"Special doctors of gynaecological oncology treat this disease best, and their reception is mostly located in large cities," says Jordan.
Although distant treatments are becoming more common and the importance of distance is reduced, the researcher also proposes an increase in the mobility of doctors in order to allow specialists to treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programmes to support patients far from home.
According to Dr Jordan’s study, the long-term survival rate of women with ovary cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and better preventive programmes for cancer.
The research funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a family mother in Gold Coast, who was 33 years old, Elisha Neavella, found malicious ovarian cancer.
The town of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the stationary shoe park in a friendly park next to the hotel in Pohjanhov.
On Monday, the city government decided that the proposal for a position plan for the Friendship Park and its surrounding environment would be set in Osuitta for public sight.
Opinions on the draft proposal are requested from the Environment Board and the Lapland Ely Centre.
This changes in size will allow the city to continue its motorcycle activity in the area of tourism.
It is intended to create a park area that holds the area between the present Loyalty Park and the river.
Up to 15 November to 30 April, a maximum of 200 engine hoses will be available on the ground.
It shall also be allowed to invest tank points in the designated part.
The new park area is also allowed for maintenance.
The town of Rovaniemi has rented the area of the Friendship Park to Safari companies for motorcycles during winter.
The lease agreement has been renewed last spring 2014 and the contract will be valid for spring 2018.
Increasing park activity and change in the formula have caused even loud opposition.
The residents of the neighbouring layers have been clumsy in their voices as well as in their concerns about emissions.
However, emissions in the region have been investigated and no observations have been made above the guidelines.
Renewed equipment is even more low-emission.
The park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that, if the place of departure was moved further, safarian customers should be transported to the Safari departures by buses estimated to be 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area of the friendship park and the surrounding environment are also wide enough, better than the locations presented for replacement starting points, such as the east side of the Ounsjoki bridges.
The park of friendship is good for its location because activities can, for example, extend to the area of Ounaspavilion in the future.
The consolidation of park activities is part of the urban strategy adopted by Rovaniemi City Council, which aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by providing sufficient high-quality areas for logistically and functionally advantageous locations.
The friendship park is also labelled as the starting point of the motor race in the central general scheme, which has not yet received legal power.
The fall in ownership housing is seen in garden stores
The decrease in the number of residential owners, especially in the group under 35 years, may lead to a reduction in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions when the young consumers of this day reach garden sales for their age.
According to the Financial Times report, apartment rentals use only 55% of the money spent by home owners in garden care.
The study has also revealed that more and more people live in very urban apartments without gardens, and also the garden size is reduced as the front garden is increasingly covered as a parking lot, and these factors also threaten the garden area with an estimated value of about 5 billion pounds per year.
In the large district of London, housing has decreased from 61% to 43% in six years, and garden products are used to use the lowest per household in the whole country.
According to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), the increase in renting housing or the decrease in garden size does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the leading garden counselling of RHS, says, "for example, plants grown in transferable breeding containers are particularly popular among house rentals, as such breeding containers can be included as necessary."
According to the HTA report, between 1997 and 2005, the period of re-sale in the garden sector was due to the increase in housing and wealth from the end of the 80s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will grow this year, thanks to better weather conditions, after last year's weather in March and April.
Turkey is interrogating the US diplomat for the purposes of the spying report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the country's most experienced US diplomatic report on the American and British spying in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the US Embassy Minister and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German Der Spiegel magazine and the web magazine The Intercept have written that the documents leaked by the former American National Security Agency (NSA) Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey was the main spying target for US and British intelligence services.
According to the Turkish news offices, the Turkish President, Mr Tayyip Erdogan, reduced the importance of the report, saying that all the major states have been blinding each other.
The previous report on spying from the German main intelligence service to Ankara resulted in a more angry reaction to the Turkish government.
The Cannes winner Croze appears in a new Finnish film
Marie-Josée Croze, a Canadian actor in several successful movies, has been attached to the main part of the new Finnish film.
Croze plays director Mikko Kuparinen's film for 2 nights till morning, whose shootings start this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the best female head of the Cannes movie party for the role of the Barbarian invasion in 2003.
He has been performing, among other things, in Steven Spielberg's film in Munich and Julian Schnabel in the butterfly film.
Two nights till morning, the male head of the film is Mikko Rausien.
The film will receive Finland's first night in September 2015.
Chief of Police of Mallorcan Magaluf charged for corruption
Indicators of the case presented evidence of the extortion by the police and the government of Calvià at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Head of Police of Calvià, located on Mallorca holiday island, has been arrested as a result of the corruption accusations made by the business and bar owners of Magaluf, known for the feasting of moisture.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was put in prison after several business owners of the Punta Ballena street charged corruption against him. Most of the Magaluf bars and night clubs are located on the Punta Ballena street.
According to Mallorca Diario published in the network, the indicators of the case presented evidence of the extortion by the police and the government of Calvià at Mallorca's Office for Anti-corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are questioned by the judge together with Navarro.
The newspaper ABC, published throughout the country, wrote about the neutrality of the nightclub owners, which significantly compromised their business.
"There's no more money in this thing, but a survival," said one of the business owners to the Court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines of magazines in several countries this summer when the online YouTube video spread, where a 18-year-old British vacationer had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub Crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to control Magaluf’s drowsy and uncontrollable use by reducing the number of malicious, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse Nightclub, where the oral video was filmed, was assigned to close for a year, and a fine of EUR 55 000 was imposed on the owner of the nightclub and the organiser of pub Crawl to Carnage.
Above all, among young British tourists, the recommended tourist destination in Magaluf has also been recommended by the so-called ballconing trend, which has caused several accidents caused by alcohol consumption when people have jumped from balconing to another or from balconing to the pool of the hotel.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of children of Israel in the Gaza Strip returned to school after having spent the summer on Monday in bomb protection when rockets and grenades bombed their communities in the 50 - day war of Israel and Hamas, and the schools were closed when the region recovered from battles.
The opening of the schools brought joy and excitement to the bombings of rockets in the communities of the southern Israel, but the traces of the battles remain visible.
In the city of Ashad in Pashosh Day Home in the south, workers removed traces of fragments from walls and slidings before the children arrived in the raket after the daycare.
"We are a little scared, but we are also enthusiastic," says Ronit Bart, who lives in the Kibbuts, the Israeli community, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area need hard routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, feels like a little weird coming to school for a long time.
"We have had some difficult times when we didn't leave home anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbuts near the Gaza border offering support.
Before last week’s ceasefire, thousands of residents of Saad’s border communities had remained indoors or left homes outside Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of Gaza are suspicious of return after the death of the Palestinian grenade in the Community of a four-year-old boy.
According to the Ministry of Education, just ten families had not come back yet.
The children of these families have been placed in alternative schools so far.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza Border, which was targeted by heavy Palestinian fires.
He encouraged children to study diligently and promised that "children's education and safety will be taken care of".
Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire which is currently in force last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the battles, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas' demand for the removal of the island of Israel and Egypt and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea roads.
Israel wants to take off Hamas’ weapons and return the body of two soldiers of Israel who fell in war.
In Egypt, a new round of indirect negotiation will be expected later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, even though it had no strong evidence of this.
On the side of Israel, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including Thai workers, died.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers shot 4 591 rockets and grenades in Israelite cities, mostly in the south.
In turn, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air attacks and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and estimated 250 000 people fled to cover more than 100 UN schools that had been transformed into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and in battle, the school authorities moved the beginning of the school in the previous week.
"I hope that the school will soon open and we will get back to school, just like the other children in the world and just like the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, 13 years old, who lives in shelter in the city of Gaza.
According to the generally used indicator, housing prices have risen most in seven years during the winter seasons of Australia.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic price index for apartments in the capital of Australia rose by 1.1 per cent in August, showed data from RP on Monday.
Due to the rise in prices in summer, July and August, the overall increase in prices was 4.2 per cent, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as compared to the 12 months before August 2013, but the price has not risen steadily throughout the country.
According to Tim Lawless, the research director of RP Data said Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
RP Data results show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne in the previous year.
Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin's housing markets are next to the strongest; the average increase in prices is from five to six per cent.
The weakest housing markets are in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring in Australia began to increase the number of dwellings in sales over the coming months, which is a real test on the housing market.
"In view of the increase in the sale of auctionable dwellings, the overall vigilante rate of sales and the continuing low rate of interest rates, it is likely that the increase in housing prices will continue in the next three months", says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has pulled record audiences from the Mäntt
The new museum and photography have attracted renowned audiences this summer from Mantta.
By the end of August, more than 70 000 guests have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and there has been classical works of pop art, among other things, from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
On Monday, I was told that I had a visitor record when 14 500 interested people had visited the Minute event this summer.
It's not used to these figures.
People have been shoveled from doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors throughout the year will come to the Serlachius museums this year to approach a hundred thousand.
In previous years, there have been some 40 000 visitors.
The Mäntta-Vilppula, in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11 000 inhabitants.
The museum leader, Sivonen, reminds us that the new museums are always a phenomena when opening up.
"The challenge is to make the phenomena permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the art season will continue far beyond the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened in the art museum.
The police are investigating four thieves in Kajaan last few days.
Sunday night, in the North Pole, a business property was broken by breaking a window.
He had gotten a small amount of money from the cash machine.
Between Thursday and Monday on the deep street, fuel was stolen from the truck tank.
The boat was taken from the ferry port again between Sunday and Monday with the boat’s rectangle engines.
The whistle boat was a fish pallata-marked outside of light and indoor cylindrical.
On the inside, the text "OIVA" was read on the snake side.
A couple of suspects from stealing cops have already gotten caught.
Sunday night, in Tikkapuron, a business property was hacked.
The police dog received a copy, and the 20-year-old palm-man was found in the woods hiding under the tree.
On Monday, the police caught another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of guilty of the same breakthrough.
The missing amphetamine brought the murder charge in Kajaan.
The disappearance of less than 10 grams of amphetamine was charged with the murder of the Cajanianist who was born in 1977.
According to the prosecution, the man had gone to the apartment with his ex-husband and with another man and shot the owner of the 34-year-old Cayanan who suspected the drug exporter.
The defendant contested the charges and claimed that the other man was involved as a shooter.
The case came to the police when a police force stopped a passenger car where a date was burning the clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the burned garments, a cut shotgun was found in the car.
The Court of First Instance of Kainuu will be sentenced later.
August was rarely warm in many places.
According to the Air Science Institute, equally warm August repeats on average in ten years.
Aeronautics statistics show that the average temperature was higher than normal throughout the country.
In most of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the hay and August flakes, the whole summer became more warm than usual.
The highest temperature throughout the summer was measured during the first week of August in Por, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in 1958 in a family of migrants from seven children, Dudley, in the midlands of Britain.
Henry's father worked in the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary discussion with his father and has been developed on the basis of a radio 4 channel series.
The sound track is a mixture of reggae and rape in upbeat.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He's been in therapy several times since his mother's death, and he's thinking a lot about his relationship with his father.
It was very hard to read my father.
His face was never seen, only the voice said, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were already grown up when I was a kid, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of a beer stick or the beauty of a cricket.
I never talked to him about things like that.
For most of my life, he was that smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal alloy plant in Dudley and thus became aware of the way his father’s life must have been, even though working conditions are better than at that time.
Colds are a little lighter today, but they are practically dark, smoked, labyrinth-like depths with flames, smoke, and rising, and bringing to mind the seal.
My father used to go to a bath and only in the bathtub, and slowly he began to sing when he was washing the melting moth away from himself.
As I walked around the fridge, I realized that he had been doing that job for years to get us food on the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Despite this, Henry’s childhood lacked the closeness offered by his parents.
My father never hugged, never said he loved me.
Only when my mother began to get sick a little before she died, we began to start with each other that we loved each other.
Henry has his daughter, Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love that he lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep saying, "I love you"?
Stop hugging!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry is still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the causes that led to mother's death.
When I began to suffer from overweight and diabetes, my doctor told me to make a complete translation.
After that, I began a lot in the municipalities, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult...
And boring.
Nobody enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard may reflect his change during career development.
After obtaining a lot of good feedback from critics as Othello, he has drowned to make the theater.
Next was the Comedy of Errors and August Wilson's Fences ("The Aids").
Making a theater offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedy that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started the business when he was only 16 years old.
One of the dishes found him doing imitations on the stage and contacted the New Faces talent contest.
Henry's TV career started in the middle of the '70s. "How long I was the only black imitator and comic on TV," he says.
Henry learned his job.
I had to grow up in the photography of publicity, learn to make jokes from a sliding slide between 1975 and 1985, while I was living in a distraction and was on TV.
In the Lenny New Faces talent competition in 1975
Henry's manager had the magical rights to The Black and White Minsk Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared as black make-up, so Henry ended up as a comic for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I'd never been involved, but I'm not regretting it.
Although my position was strange and aggravating, I was able to work at huge events and learn how to deal with the public.
Yet the "principal, multi-year-old favorite and light entertainment program" of the British TV was, at the same time, a disgusting parade of black people.
Henry worked in the '80s in the second series of comedy, where both were made a joke and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the '90s Henry was known, for example, as cook Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
For the next decade, Henry spent ads, documents, TV series and film sections, but after his LennyHenry.tv series in BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "What are you going to do, Len – now it looks like you're just on your spot or on the sidewalk"?
Next up, the Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About..."?
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not actually properly taught at school, and I think it belonged to a white middle class who wears panties and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare theme woke me in fear.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, " Try.
Don't leave the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Meet words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 rays about Othello's last speech for a documentary, and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It felt close to me as if some part of me had been missing earlier, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it is about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your bag, do a little background study.
So the exercise process was hard, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently it was expected to fail, but it did not exactly happen.
Shortly thereafter, Henry was playing the main part of the Erehdys comedy.
Suddenly, I played at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it was true.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
One time there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his task to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, "You have to take 10 minutes alone until the computer works again."
Instead, the director’s assistant announced that the presentation will be continued as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked out of the scene, and some of me sneaked out of relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role."
Henry's "Fences" play at the Duchess Theatre
Teaching the mountains for the "Fences" sample was a challenge.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a man more lasting.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you have to do."
This is what Henry says with a voice.
I mean, I decided to stay here.
I really love this job.
I love internship rooms.
Henry, however, is still a comic in essence: our conversation is continually interrupted by small humorous sons when he switches from imitation to another.
The arrest of the Stand-up Committee is a matter of will, as it seems dangerous to receive direct thanks from an unknown public.
If you keep thirsting for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at Apollo's theater when it feels like it, but, in general, it doesn't get me excited the way it used to be.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go to a new stand-up tour.
It really makes me happy to sit with a director who helps to shape the entire journey from the beginning, the middle stage and the end, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really funny.
The show keeps telling the story, and I am enjoying the mission.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya is drawing up a register of officials to remove "Ghost workers"
Kenya has started to draw up a biometric register of officials in trying to remove "Ghost workers" from the government's salaries.
Employees who did not sign up in the register during the next two weeks should no longer be paid, were reported in the Government Communication.
The government doubts that thousands of people will still be paid to pay after they have left their duties as officials.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to break down the corruption of the public sector after entering office in 2013.
The previous audit of this year shows that the wages and other economic abuses of "spirit workers" cost at least a million dollars a month.
The government suspects that the wages will be paid to the account after the person has died or left his duties as a civil servant, the BBC Wanyama Chebusiri reports on the capital of Nairobi.
All officials should report themselves to the register during the next few weeks in the identification centres in order to ensure that their data are stored in a biometric format of registration, it was reported in the government communication.
According to the Bulletin, any person who fails to do this without due cause will be removed from the wage lists.
"This measure will considerably rationalise the public sector, because this defines how many people are actually working in their tasks, and also cleans salaries at both levels of the government, so as to solve the problem of the 'Ghost Workers'," says Anne Waiguru, the office officer of the Ministry of Decentralisation and Design.
The result of the 2015 financial year of the Wall River may remain a deficit of EUR 25.5 million if the city does not adapt to its activities and expenditure developments in a tensile economic situation.
Based on the current preparation of the budget, the annual figure remains about 9.4 million deficits.
The potential ways of improving the scope and level of the services were to block, to buy services, to sell assets and grants and to increase tax and payment revenues.
The 10 million euro reduction target for investment amounts to 8.5 million.
There is no relief to the situation of the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, the insufficient increase in tax revenues, the increasing unemployment and the 5% reduction of government contributions will further deteriorate the prospects.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be converted to the objective of the strategy, notes President Kimmo Heinonen of the municipality.
The city government returned the proposals to prepare the board.
The proposals of the city government are based on budgetary preparation at the Economic Seminar of the Council in Fram on Monday 8 September.
Following the mandate, the draft budget will be forwarded through a committee procedure to the municipalities and the municipal council.
Ten Turkish police officers under arrest for suspicion against the 'trines' government
In all cases 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects of "anti-government plots", reports by local media sources.
The police did not immediately comment.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 high-level police officers.
Some of the police were involved in recent December corruption investigations involving government officials, including four government ministers.
In July a number of police officers were arrested in Turkey for organising a wide range of criminal crimes and following their phones.
The Turkish President, Mr Tayip Erdogan (who was the Prime Minister at that time), said that the police's actions were part of the planned action against him and the others in charge of the Islamic Director Fethulllah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of the schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer vacations.
This is a traditionally significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the awaiting journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first-day ceremonies of September were not spent in every school.
There is no peace in the whole Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the whole huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexander Pastukhov, who is the leading teacher at Slavianski School, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter visits, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn something that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first school day include traditionally the children’s written shirts, balloons and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to Texas Perry, the wrecking twittet was unauthorized.
On Sunday night, a ugly image of the Democratic District Attorney was sent from the confirmation of the Texas Governor Rick Perry's Twitter account, during the hearing of the accusations of the abuse of power.
Tweetti was removed later, followed by a new tweet, where Perry swore that she had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
"I do not accept Tweet and I have removed it," said the later publication.
Perry's backup forces did not respond immediately to clarification requests.
Although the Tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it's unclear who published the picture.
The first twittet included a blasphemy sketch of Travis district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, condemned in April 2013.
Perry prevented the financing of Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month while Perry was accused. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential elections.
The title of Tweet said, "I don't always drive drunk, three times more promille than allowed... but when that happens, I blame governor Perry for showing with a finger."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office did not conduct a large jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was carried out by Michael McCrum, a special attorney in San Antion, who was ordered by the Republican emperor.
Perry has said he's innocent and called accusations to be political.
His influential judiciary has asked the judge to dismiss the accusations and said that the law on which the most distant governor in Texas is being accused is unambiguous against the Constitution.
Perry cut off EUR 7.5 million of state aid to the public integrity department of the State, which operates in the Travis district and prosecutes the public sector when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry’s decision received a formal complaint from the follow-up group on the left.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes also famously.
After the fifth place at the Iowa electoral meeting during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry threatened to stop playing the same game by publishing on Twitter a picture of himself flying in a lake with the text "Here we are coming, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says the housing market is "normal" again.
One of the most important buildings in London has warned that the South-Eastern residential market has "returned" to normal levels of activity.
In London, the capital city of London has been troubled by a huge demand and a sharp increase in prices while a wide-ranging credit bubble has been feared, which led the Bank to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of the high-level builder, said that "from the beginning of the financial year, the market and the number of shops have returned to normal after 2013" and added that this has enabled "a stable operating environment".
During a very recession in the London housing market, foreign investors pursued a flock to the capital.
According to the country register, housing prices in the city increased by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales by 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student buildings rose in about the fifth year of the year before, reaching a price increase of 423 000 pounds by the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made London's property less attractive in the last few months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new real estate tax laws and political rhetorics from a possible "kartano tax" before the general elections in May.
Last week, the London real estate broker Foxtons warned that the April mortgage loan report, in which more stringent lending orders were reported, would lead to lower market growth, both in terms of sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
On Monday, the recent information from the Bank of England showed that the amount of loans approved decreased in July, which refers to the cooling housing market.
Real estate owner Hamptons International has decreased its forecast for 2015 at the prices of London's real estate. According to this, prices fall by three per cent, as the index of the prices of the home owners' opinions has already started to weaken.
The number of purchases made in London's most expensive areas in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen in a quarter of the year ago, says WA Ellis, the real estate broker.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, who increased income from the properties sold to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added that "the demand for the well-planned, correct product in the best locations has remained stable and therefore sales have remained vigorous".
In June, the company reported that it sold 3 742 new homes in the previous April year, which is almost a third more than during the pre-economic crisis peak in 2007.
The annual profits calculated before taxes increased by 40 per cent to 380 million pounds per year, and the turnover increased by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley told me that Berkeley's earnings correspond to the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before taxes is 450 million pounds per year.
In the afternoon, Berkeley's stock sold evenly at the London Stock Exchange at 23,96 pounds.
The hacker spilled Jennifer Lawrence's naked web.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th annual Academy Awards awards.
A hacker who claims to hold pictures of a hundred other stars spilled the Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence's naked videos on the Internet.
The star of the star of starry confirmed that the pictures were real and condemned the hacker for "sufficient injuries of privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and all those who publish Jennifer Lawrence's stolen images will be charged.
The pictures originally published on the 4chan release page were apparently wrong because of the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. A hundred other Stars that are being hacked are alleged to be on the list of dozens of other female stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
It is not known how much of the pictures are real, though Scott Pilgrim against the World Star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those who look at the pictures I and my husbands in privacy years ago: I hope you'll have a good time," Winstead Twiittatta.
However, the Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series denied the authenticity of the pictures and the twist that "that are the naked pictures of me that you don't understand."
Let me finish this immediately.
BuzzFedin announced late Sunday that the representative of the popster Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the image of the star.
The only thing we've ever seen is the new novel that has received thanks to Howard Jacobson, telling us about love and j.
They slipped, it pictured what was best, and gradually they swept apart like a box of cardboard left out in the rain.
Only occasionally he heard from a woman that was too serious, too hard, intensive, dispersed, and perhaps a little bit squeaky.
That's when he squeezed his hand.
He identified the snake.
Yeah, he was like a silk.
His last victim had been at the beginning of a relationship, however, promising; it had appeared that this relationship could have helped his lonely boredom, and it might have brought even some content in his life.
Solomons had unharmed hair, and he was a delicate beauty with a joyful heart from the northern village, which was even harsher and farther away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling partner, which Kevern assumed to be his aunt. Aunt had inherited a house located in a moist but paradise valley, and the name of the valley was appropriately Paradise valley.
He hadn't lived in the house in years.
The pipes fell, all the bathrooms had spiders, the ethanes had left their marks in the windows, keeping their entire place on their own, and in the garden there was grasses that reminded me of giant clayheads.
The house was like children's rain, at the same time threatening and magical, garden full of secrets.
Says by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is subject to a booker booker booker prize in 2014.
The proposals will be published next week
The kever had sat in hand with Ailn in a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprising warm spring afternoon, both listening distractionally to the receiver, through which the whole country heard calm music and calming news when the crossed legs of Ailin brought to Kevern’s mind a song that had long ago been sang by the black performers that had been forgotten and that his father had often listened to the bunkers below.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were basically too aggressive and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not banned — nothing was actually banned — but they were no longer played.
They wanted to forget, just like the word unhola itself.
The public opinion resulted in what had not been achieved by law and declaration: just as people at the corner of literature chose to read the memoirs of heroes, cooking books and romance, they prefer ballades in music.
By the day, Kevern began to use the imaginary piano and sings a ceremonial ceremony to the big legs of Ailinn.
You didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of the jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and at the same time he lifted two fingers in front of his mouth.
That's how his father had always done before he got away from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let the word "j" out of your mouth, and you didn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay for a penny.
It wasn't very funny at the time, and it wasn't even now.
He knew it was from him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what Jazz was.
I've never heard anything like that before.
Even Jazz was not actually declared banned, it was not just called.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room in life for one word.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It had been the same way to be smart.
Its unpredictableness made people nervous.
And Jazz was the cleverness of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of ten, he had become familiar with jazz music through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailn that Fats Waller was black.
Considering Ailinn’s age, it was likely that he did not remember the time when the popular singers were not black.
Even here there was no need for laws or forcing.
A famous society meant that each part of it accepted the principle that each group did natural things for it — thankfully, that they had been saved by happiness in trade.
Based on their temperament and physical properties, people with the Afro-Caribbean family are best suited to entertain and sport, so they sang and ran.
Initially, those from the Indian continent were naturally talented with electrical equipment, so their mission was to ensure that each family had a working phone used to handle matters.
Those left of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
WHEN SE, WHEN WHEN THE FLOWS, JOS TAPAHTUY came true, those from the Gulf of Persia and the Middle East had not fled hardly in fear that they would be accused of sweeping flames and fearing that these flames would catch them next, opened restaurants serving the labneh yogurt and burned the water pipe, and continued to look at their lives created and depressed in the ground.
Everyone should act according to their gifts.
Alinn had only heard ballades, and it was hard for him to understand how the offensive words that Kever just sang had ever been dressed as music.
The music was the expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except for the big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created illusion for safety.
No word would pass through the sound isolation of giant cavalry heads.
Still, he didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to lift two fingers on his lips with Ailinn.
I thought he was weird right now.
"That was funny," he said instead.
Ailn dropped his head in disloyal, and his hair covered Kever's field of vision.
There's nothing more to see in the world than Ailin's huge, shaky hair flavor.
She didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say so," he said he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it for me.
It seemed like he was really confused.
Are my legs so big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for it.
"You're attractive to me because of your fat ankles," he tried to fix it.
I've been perverted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because, like his father, he lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father had meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite their gentle eyes.
Solomons was red, rising from the terrace chair, stabbing at the same time the receiver and spraying the wine they had just been drinking.
Even the wine was made from the backbone, so he couldn't use it as a reason for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shiver like palm tree leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is what's gotten to be attracted to me in you," he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
The kever felt sorry for Ailn, both for his own, unnecessary cruel words, and for the fear that was seen in his eyes at the moment Ailn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailn think he was gonna hit?
He had never told Kevern about his life in the shy northern archipelago where he had grown, but Kevern was sure that it had basically been the same as life here.
The same gigantic, filthy sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though, after the TAPAHTUNE, were even bleacher and more fierce than their smuggler and dismantling fathers, wandered from pub to pub, ready to hit every woman who would dare to resist or harass them.
Fat head?
He'd see a fat fist if he wasn't careful!
Immuta first – kissing had become the most common word of the man and woman’s erotic encounter; the receiver was an antidote to unimportant love ballades, and then attack.
The kevern thought that too much, for the absorbing itself was hostile.
The body language of Alinn Solomons urged him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern’s grief surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailn followed his journey — just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go from the upstairs window — a man who was responsible for his life as a heavy one.
Adam's leaving the garden, he was thinking.
He felt pity for Kevern and men in general, even though some of them had lifted their hands against him to hit him.
The man who turned his back, bowling, disgraceful, beaten, lost all the will of battle — why did he feel that he knew that vision so well, even though he did not remember that he had seen before this moment?
When Alinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, the intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private facility measuring the General Mind in Ofnow, conducted a short study of the continuation of minor and medium-sized violence in the areas of the country where the reduction of violence, or even an end, was most likely, taking into account the money and energy used to break it.
"A lot has already been done, and much has not yet been done," he wrote, "that can be compensated for thousands of years of struggles, and most of the people who have won, the natural aggression, especially in the abandoned and distant corners, where, despite the churches beyond the hedges, human humiliation is rarely known at the time.
Some things, however, could not be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower its desires are.
The people cry among the centimental ballads, rape stories of defeated conflicts and swore in the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, while at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty keeps in harsh control of both country communities and urban co-dwelling areas, and there is also evidence of a new kind of, more evil-spirited dispute in homes, workplaces, streets and even playground parks.
"You have a regrettable tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the whole report.
I'd suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped his eyes on the ground.
In addition, I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I believe I don't have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Esme continued appealing to the court not to answer personal questions.
The feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I'm not asking," said Luther Rabinowitz, 'cause I'm opposed to atheism, lesbosexuality and feminism.
There are no prejudices to this job.
We are servants of a unprecedented society.
Although a certain type of hypersensitivity is completely acceptable and respectable on its own, it may sometimes lead to distorted results, to what you have just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church — and what you call cruelty or evil spirit, others usually call it energy and physical strength.
It is as if it had happened yesterday, if it had all happened, it would destroy the fundamental power of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while talking to Rabinowitz.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, the flamingon election LED light declared a guide that Ofnow had distributed to the country for a quarter or longer than the previous century.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballades, go to musicals, use your phone, discuss, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and the sang word is better than written, but nothing wins love.
"I understand well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum answered with a silent voice when he was sure that his director had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effective as we imagine ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will see the same mistakes that were originally led by SIIHEN, which led to the death of the world.
However, this time we do not bleed our hatred and disrespect to others.
Luther Rabinowitz made a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're not going too far," he said, "when you describe it as 'defects' of what our grandparents may have done or have not done.
You will also go too far, saying that they spilled their hatred and disrespect to others.
A person like you should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past or defending the present, we are not talking about 'we' or 'they'.
There was no 'we' or 'other'.
That was the time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are completely honest, in that chaos," Esme dare to continue, "no group of society can say that she behaved well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
What they did was good or bad.
That's when it was.
There is no need to talk more about it – that is what we agree on.
And just as there are unnecessary accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether appropriate or not, and even if there is a way of doing them.
But what's the past for if they don't learn from it --
The past exists so we can forget about it.
If I can add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and showed that Esmen was about to leave.
The next day, when he went to work, the normal way he was hit by a motorcyclist driving on a pedestrian, who was described as a "great and fierce".
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho's army forbids the attack to plan; the Prime Minister will remain in South Africa.
Legislators of the Lesotho Army have refused to set up a government strike for blowing and said that they were acting against a police officer who was suspected to attempt to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane escaped from the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official dwelling and conquered government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The head of the state traveled with his family to the neighbouring country after telling South Africa that he had a death penalty.
Major Ntle Ntoi, a representative of the army, said that this was the way the army responded to the threat from the "political fanatics," said the police were trying to arm fanatics.
"Lesotho Defense Forces took action after receiving a number of intelligence that some police forces attempt to arm young party fanatics when they were prepared to cause problems," he told Voice of America News Office.
According to Clayson Monjela, the president of the South African government, military activities seemed to be a revolutionary attempt.
"Although no entity has claimed to revoke the government by means of force, the action of the Lesotho Defence Forces seems to all sides equivalent to the signs of the revolutionary enterprise," he says.
According to Lesotho’s military officials, soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful atmosphere.
In the meantime, Vice-President Mothethjoa Metsing is in charge of the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes he's being targeted because he's been trying to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane interrupted parliamentary sessions because of the differences between the government of the great coalition.
He so denies that he deducted the government's power, although it is otherwise claimed.
Commercial newspaper: Microsoft will set up a data centre in New Zealand
The IT company Microsoft has set up a large data centre in Uusallemaa at a place where the company is unable to specify.
In a note sent to Microsoft’s media, the company notes that it does not indicate the location of all its data centres for safety reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment for Microsoft of hundreds of millions of dollars.
In public, Oulu or Kajania had previously been spotted to the centre.
Microsoft completes the end of Oulu’s office, which takes jobs away from around 500 people.
Overall, Microsoft has announced that he will leave up to 1 050 jobs in Finland.
The Microsoft Communication Manager Camilla Lindfors tells STT that the company does not comment on how much staff the new data centre employs.
To establish a data centre in New Zealand, the Commerce magazine reported on Monday.
The man is charged with a girl driving on the road lighting.

Gordon Stewart is charged with driving a girl on a cruise in Pittenween, Eastern Neuk.
According to the prosecutors, Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 car unconsciously and hurting the girl.
Stewart, 78 from Andruther, denied charges at the Dunde Sheriff's session.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial in January.
Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos under water, you will be able to select a number of different devices options.
The cheapest option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both cost about $300.
I took these pictures at a family party using several different cameras, each cost less than $ 350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Check your equipment twice every time.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera battery and other parts are closed waterproofly.
Set the camera description settings to match images or videos to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of cameras and video cameras have a regulation to optimise the description conditions under water.
In addition, before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can be taken.
Some cameras only hold 5 feet deep, others up to 50-60 feet.
Find out both standard and water-proof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have a LCD display that can blend the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have a LCD, it's hard to see underwater, and the image blending can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows you to grab, which means taking a number of images at a time with different settings, make use of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light drops considerably deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when you take pictures in a swimming pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you can see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is an important advice on the country's description, but even more important underwater, because the light conditions are low.
It is very important when there is a action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of image, i.e. the photographer must be close to the target so that the target can fill the entire image through frames.
China will not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – protestors swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that the voters in Hong Kong must not choose candidates in spite of the growing democratic reform in 2017.
It is likely that the decision will give rise to the long-awaited protests of the Hong Kong Business World, since the activists have started to plan and implement mental expressions only hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress to give the Communists practically the power to remove all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was expected, but it is still annoying," says the President of the Democratic Party, legislature Emily Lau.
This isn't what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are dealing with a sovereign government.
Li Fei, Vice-President of the Committee of the People's Congress of China, defended the Chinese administration, saying that a general candidate to choose the Head of Hong Kong would be too "shady".
From 1997 onwards, the United Kingdom gave Hong Kong to China Beijing to the residents of the region that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to the Chinese leaders, the Sunday decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it will also make it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the Appointment Committee that is being managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
In the summer preceding the decision, Hong Kong held some of the largest and most remarkable protests in the region for years.
The Occupy Central With Love and Peace campaign was largely behind a campaign to defend democracy, whose organizers have threatened to prevent business block operations if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine public voting right.
On Sunday night, only hours after the decision was published, hundreds of sponsors of the Occupy Central were gathered in the rain before the main government buildings in Hong Kong.
In an admission, the organisers of the movement announced that the movement would be switched to a new age of non-circumcision, and they would generate protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not say details, apparently, with fear that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
The organizers published on the network in their communications said that the movement "conceives the Occupy Central practice as the last means to be introduced only if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way".
We are very sorry to report that today the last chance for dialogue has been eroded and that the launch of the centre will happen.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and on Sunday security operations were rigorous near the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest feeds many people the feeling that the inhabitants are slowly losing power in their city.
The wave from the mainland has caused competition in products and services.
Furthermore, there is fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its mental expressions threaten the living conditions of Hong Kong — the business world.
"The protest they are talking about can lead to major economic losses, depending on how many people take it and how long it will last," says legislature Regina Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is falling away from us.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
The Chinese government has also presented stories that Hong Kong's democratic activists are the hosts of the revolutionary western powers.

Your prom tradition in the United States hits British universities: for new students, private streets
We are excited to respond to the demand by setting up a first class of luxury travel for students today in Britain.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also offers other means of transport, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most ever-for-all arrival of the university.
According to Stewart, there is also a safety aspect in the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise haul their assets across the country in cars loaded along the edge of the country.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to provide students of today with as simple and high-quality transport to the university as possible.
According to the company’s representative, reservations have not yet been made because the service has only been established, but it added that "students will start the orders in the next few weeks".
The company believes that there is demand for the service, although most students pay 9 000 pounds of annual fees.
Today's students are very different from those of 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it is more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and the VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, a national student organisation criticises a service that is not realistic.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Organisation's Higher Education Department, said: "This service plan seems to be really far away from the life of the students' majority."
Many of their studies will start at the level of living costs when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has remained behind the turbulent increase in basic life costs. The next question can be considered where thousands of people would be found to use as simple as campus.

Basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin was fainting in the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was today occupied by Finnish victory.
He was able to forget his deep-hearted U.S. fight and back Ukraine's second half blood with his standing solutions.
But Salin transferred all honor to the Susifans and did it in style:
I was going to faint in that field at the end, and that encouragement was so great.
In his eyes, I was drowning, nothing could do.
That noise and the white public sea were almost too much for me.
Salin’s power times kept nine surfaces in a fast pace, balloon robbers, plates, and twerps everywhere.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flow state that everything worked out.
It's just that they come up sometime, right now in an extremely important place, Sasu glowed.
It's my role.
Do all that.
It was great to see that the rest of us got caught.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is a team of joy pills and spirits, so it's not surprising that his example brought the whole team on a flight that was too much for a big and hard-headed Ukrainian fifty.
In the Finnish MM race after 32 years of break: Previously on Easter, a serious judiciary
Heikki Montonen, bearing cats, was Finland's main coach at the 1982 World Tournament in Argentina.
It's been 32 years since the Finnish men's balloon team played the last time in the World End Tournament.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and the current player-Agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament like yesterday: it was a firefighting fight against France in the first part.
"In the final balls of this game, the judge's game was ugly," recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already set up the back line.
Suddenly, the game was continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the shit went more crazy," said Parkkali.
Finland played the main coach Heikki under Montose's command and finally placed on the 17th.
Now Finland is once again among the world's elections when the Polish MM tournament is in progress this Saturday.
Many things have changed severely in the international balloon over the last 32 years.
Players' power values are approximately the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average length of players has also increased.
The game is even faster," thought Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
Finnish gambling material is widened and the burden can be shared.
I'm waiting for Finland to continue from the beginning.
Then you can get tight enough," says Kosonen.
Seppo Sirka
Olli Nenonen, Joko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were hit in a battle against Tunisia.
The current player-Agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the MM tournament.

The Finnishists saved Cita's dog from the mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all the thanks."
When Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs were in trouble on Thursdays in the mountains, Antti and Tumo Soini offered themselves boldly to help.
The weekend Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook so that you could thank his helpers again.
Mikkelsen told me in a public Facebook update that a Cita dog who had been with him on Thursday in the mountains hurt his pie.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in a sharp ground.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I didn't make it, so I had to let it go.
I tried to lure and pull it a little further, but its legs weren't just wearing, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no assistance from the police, from a close hotel or bypassers.
As the night was dark, the situation already seemed threatening.
Fortunately, there were two wanderers who were willing to help: Antti Soini, the Tamperian, and the Judge of her father.
Men had visited the highest mountain of Norway on Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm with the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini will tell him in a message she sent to Sanom.
Soon there was a German man who had a tour with him.
There were couples like a bat to Cita who had a hurt dog attached to.
A German man came after us a moment after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog in his arms for a moment from the front, Soini says.
KUVA: Judge Soini
The dog could have been dragged down by a trajectory.
Soin said the performance was not physically heavy, but in a difficult landscape, it went slowly.
However, about one and a half hours later, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen is still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them again.
The phones answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still unattended.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have been back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the thanks and honor, and I will be eternally grateful to them.
On Monday night, the Soins were on their way home.
They had gotten a happy news from Mikkelsen, and I heard that Cita was feeling better!

Genetic deviation is often misdiagnosed
A British woman feared for years of death because of the wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he had only a few years of life left because he had another disease diagnosed.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth’s disease (CMT). It means a number of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
According to Charity CMT UK, the wrong diagnosis is a general problem in CMT cases because so little is known.
According to estimates, about 23 000 people in Britain are suffering from CMTs, which cause symptoms in motor time, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking, and tooth pain.
Disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is irreversible and progressive, which means that the symptoms are worsening over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he would be sick of Friedreich's ataxia (FA) with a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he'd be in a wheelchair before he met 18 and died before he reached 30 years of age.
Today, the mother of two children, 51 years old, says, "as a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as others.
I fell every day, and it took me longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or roll with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran in a different way than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, several surgeries were performed to direct his legs. After the surgery, he quickly looked at his research papers, which said he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I looked into the library and wrote to the FA association," she says.
When I was informed, I was shocked and in a panic state.
I thought I was going to be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I met 25, and in between, I would lose my full capacity.
I went through this myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers reports that by the age of 17 he said that his walk had not worsened as much as he thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "You little girl, I don't think you're having this disease, because otherwise you're already in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something considerably less dangerous.
On the basis of some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was explained what CMT was, I thought I was postponed," he says.
Charity CMT UK organises a monthly CMT to pay attention to the disease.

On Monday, Hull also reported that he had acquired the Senegal National Team Captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
Russia's space test failed - the geeks sent to the sex journey died
The five little geckos sent to the Russian space are dead, says Roscosmos, the Russian Federation space organization.
The Geko traveled by the Photon-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the ground on Monday morning at the time of Finland.
The purpose of the test was to examine the reproductive ability and use of gecs in a weightless state.
One male gig and four females participated in the experiment.
Even though the test sounds isolated, it was a serious purpose.
The impact of weightlessness, for example, on the development of geek eggs is only limited.
The effects on genecs can be anticipated for the effects of inefficientness on the human beings in a situation similar to longer times, illustrated by New States in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death of the geeks and the cause or cause of death will be investigated.
According to Interfax, the passengers who were baptized as "sex" were frozen.
The surprising fact also shows that fruit wings traveled by the same photon-M4 were able to survive the journey, and they also gained a postmortem.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at the airport of Nice
France arrested a suspect of terrorism at the airport of Nice on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected to be a recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed it on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track him after he had attracted a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria with money.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.

The authorities contacted the father of a girl who was completely ignorant of her intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
He is, according to the authorities, from Chechnya, but now he lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had followed the man’s activities earlier.
In France, the authorities are concerned that radicalising young people attracted to Iraq or Syrian wars constitute a safety risk for France.
The authorities estimate that, during the last conflict, some 800 French citizens or French writers have travelled to Syria, returned or are currently planning to go to Syria.
Copy: We have a good chance to win
The basketball team's hopes for a further location are in the game when Finland meets today in its second match of the MM races to Ukraine.
If the opening death for the United States was expected, Ukraine is another of the countries Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have a good chance of victory, Petter Copone anticipated.
On Saturday, Ukraine hit the races in its first fight 72-62 Dominican Republic.
The team is trained by the NBA veteran Mike Fratello, who is commanded by Ukraine to play aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is the game manager Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the world champion of a hundred metres three years ago.
The Dominican Republic, Jeter, was throwing 16 points.
Pooh Jeter's quick guy, but yes, we've been playing against those before and we have to get our standard defense up, Koponen said.
Hanno Mötzla promised that Finland would play better than last night's loss to the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can assure you that we'll see a normal wolves in the field, Mötölla said.
The alleged napkin images of the Hollywood Stars are spreading online, some of them are authentic.
On the Internet, a number of naked images are supposed to be presenting famous publicity.
Among other things, actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "infection campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives, which seems to strengthen the authenticity of the images.
This is a serious violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence (Internet) will be charged, the representatives are threatening.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that her spreading images are real.
She had taken those pictures years ago with her husband.
When I know those pictures were destroyed long ago, I can only imagine what a terrible trouble they saw for this.
I feel sympathy for everyone who has been the victim of hacking, he writes the site.
Instead, the actor Victoria Justice says that the pictures that go by his name are fake.
True or fake naked images are also in motion from at least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka Malt criticizes his own: "You don't work enough to get out of here."
Football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the FC League.
After the Sunday VPS game, the painting guard Walter Vilital's comments reflect the confusional situation of the company.
I haven't had a target coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Vitala said after the fight over the 1-2-dadion.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the first half of the fight, especially in the first half.
Malayan Vitala wasn't happy to play a bad defense game.
Player traffic has been busy this summer in Hong Kong, and that is why the defendants in front of the Five have also shifted tightly.
Thanks to the player’s puzzle, many young players have also gained opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Part doesn't work enough to get out of here sometimes," the Vitala ashes without no single player being named.
Shefki Kuqi, Chief Coach of Honga, was in some respect in agreement with Viita.
"I told some players after the game that if you come to training and games to have a good time and you think you're a game player, and you don't have to work, so you're probably in the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
Kuqi recalled, however, that players cannot be expected to succeed immediately when gambling mates continue to change.
During this period, there has not been two times the same formation.
Especially in the defense head, there's been a change.
That is the biggest reason why we are in this position," Kuqi said.
Honka is a serial jumbo after the VPS loss, at the same points as the second last TPS.
There are seven more rounds left, so there is still time for the Espolians to avoid falling to One.
I've never set up a team, and I'm not gonna drop it now.
We're not going to fall out of this series," Target Guard Five was a threat.

On Tuesday, the 20 - year - old Brittle was taken to a hospital where the jaw was put back in place.
The video puzzle has become an Internet sensation, and it has been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The angle of the wolves’ weep (three): How can you explain the increase in the number of fans?
I mean, today was so awesome.
This is what Basketballist Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995 when Finland had played at the EM-end tournament against France at the Marouss Ball Hall in Athens.
It wasn't Pehkone's overreacting.
I remember the game when you were there.
So were some hundred Finns screaming at the 20 000 viewers, or to the empty halls.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the Suomi-Ukraina match.
In Bilbao, there are hundreds of Finnish fans' troops eighty times.
The 1995 EM contest was the Finnish basketball tracking time.
The men drew their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, in the Russian quarantine fight at the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory opened the doors to the European cream.
Everything looked good.
There were many promising young people, like Hanno Mötz.
Principal coach Henrik Dittmann raised Mötöla to the final tournament team.
A solution that many people disagreed with.
Now you can say that Detmann was a very far-reaching wise man, even if it didn't go well according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dives deep.
In Athens, Finns were there, known to be, a little over 100.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are also journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to uncomprehensive proportions.
I'm sure no one can say exactly the number of Finnish categorists.
The estimates have moved between 7 500 and 100,000.
Any number between them is quite an incomprehensible amount.
This is explaining to the sports sociologen.
In the global economy, businesses are cross-border.
There is still an opportunity for sport to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can go see how our girls and our sons are successful in the world, says Professor Hannu Itkonen in motion.
There must be Finns in both Spain and the World Cup of the Ballon in Poland who are seeking a living.
Common experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
Even sports need to be attracted.
Ittkonen brings sport into a popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports races than to visit Berlin to watch art.
But without success, you can't move the masses.
Let's go back to 1995.
That's when coach Detmann challenged the basketball union and the players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the ground team was lifted up.
The balloon people did the same move a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruit of the work.
As Itkanen says, both species have managed to produce their top sports where the sacred trinity works: sport media sponsors.
The public will also be interested.
And the media has taught us what such carnivalist support is, Itkonen reminds me.
Can ball sports also move this massive interest into domestic series?
On average, basketballs and balloons play for hundreds or a little more than a thousand viewers.
Attachen thinks the question is good and does not necessarily give an answer that would be very good to the species.
Another school believes that interest will move.
The other one is the one who doesn't want to sweeten his stomach full.
This group is ready for a living trip to the MM races, but in their basic thinking, home country series are not interested in two things.
It's a challenge for the folks in the middle of the drug.
Ensure for Bottann ferry - almost 1,5 hectares from the lake
Nastola rewards the trainer Valteri Botta's beach home.
The municipal government unanimously approved the release of 1,4 hectares of land at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, there will be an apartment for free time.
In Nastyla, Botta's success has been followed since this caring times.
He's being a good ambassador to market the Bay, the Lahden area and Nastalaa.
The gift site is located in Koskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has become owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of a bigger real estate store.
There are seven decommissioning buildings in the area, from which the municipality will dismantle six at cost by the end of this year.
Battas reached the formula 1 in the Belgian competition for its fourth prize balls this year.
He's the fifth one at the MM.
Battas is a native nastolian and has lived in the Philistine of his childhood.
He lives in England today, but he goes to Nastalia every time he's free of formalities.
Battas has visited high schools and youth facilities.
Design is coming, but I don't think it's for the poor.

The testers of Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are the balls in the field, but the amateur Marcus Giro, who is the top of the college players, also holds that.
He says that a shirt helps him to monitor his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors have been woven on the nail shirt, from which the information is transmitted to the locomotive in the shirt and from there to the smartphone or table computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythms, stress, and steps.
The central-unit coupling is removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not told us exactly how long it takes to start selling a shirt, nor even indicating the price of it, Tech Times news.
Raph Lauren is not the only company investing in smart clothes.
Athos, California, has sold smart shirts and smart-shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost a hundred dollars per piece and the central thumb that they require will cost two hundred dollars.

A Smart way to save in textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so soon Matt Schroeder, starting his second degree, came up with a smart way of saving costs.
He developed a system where students of later years would borrow their books against nominal compensation instead of selling the books immediately.
"My book of Mathematics would normally cost $180; I paid for it for the entire academic year $10 and a sandwich," says Schroeder, 19 years old, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder tells me that his books of the past century would normally cost $430.
Instead, he used $120 for them.
According to the University Board, the average student spends more than $1 200 a year in tuition and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students rent schoolbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the academic year and pay for it clearly less than the students buying the book.
According to Neebo Inc, more than 250 campus books stores, the rental of tuition books has doubled since 2011.
Statistical information on the sector reveals that about a quarter of the books of the university books in the spring were rental books, says Trevor Meyer, president of the Neebo company.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus books.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Online stores
In online shops, only one third of the price it would pay for a campus book shop can get a new book.
The recommended price for the nineth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book is almost $290, but the book of Special Books Chegg.com is available at $239.99.
Buy Used
Books used are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by other notes and lost appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book is available for a Chegg.com online store of $93.49.
Matt Casaday, a student of the last year at Brigham Young University, 25 years old, reports that he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" for Amazon.com for only $ 0.42.
The new book would've cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's College Without Walls, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if they can use previous pressures on the course.
Sometimes reforms of the new printing are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found with a fraction of the price that should be paid for a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookshops, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
If you take good care of them, you will remember to return them and do not need them when you have completed the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, renting the "Calculus" book for the entire academic period costs about $20.
Check out the rules of the renting company, such as notes, use of the accent and wear of the next fees.
Renter, be careful: If you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the book's purchase price.
E-mails
The acquisition of e-books instead of ordinary papers may also come to the question.
In some cases, these books are rented, where they are paid to its holder for the right to use the e-book, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store will give you a "Calculus" book by e-mail for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most because many classics can now be downloaded free of charge, whereas books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
It's worth comparing the different sellers, which option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, which will soon begin with Pepperdinen in law, recommends to use the book ISBN number to determine the price, as it can ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order from the network, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He learned this through his own stiffness.
The book she bought was frozen for four weeks, and she finally had to get the book at full cost for the university’s bookstore.

Almost double the number of people died in fires compared to last year
In fires this year, almost double the number of people have died compared to last year.
According to the media monitoring by the Finnish Rescue Centre (Spek), 55 people have already died in fires.
At the same time last year, there was 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65 years of age.
According to the Fire Death Statistics of the Organization, the last situation was worse in 2009 when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
The majority of fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in flats, 21 homes, seven in rows and other small houses.
Spec reminds me of recurring fire safety at home.
At least all fire alarms at home should be ensured by Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the first-blocking devices are easily available.
All home premises must also be an accessible exit route.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the city center of Newport to march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at the city building in Cardiff for the so - called anticipated summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed events this weekend and spoke with protesters who had arrived even since Belgium.
Young people were rescued on a flight route from the Blue Mountains of Australia
TWO teenage patrolers were raised to safety after night in the Blue Mountains in the New South Wales region of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man walked on Sunday after noon for Govets Leap to Blackheath.
The families were concerned about young people who had not returned home, and they called the police at 8:00 a.m.
A search party of local policemen and helpers was sent to search for young people, and the twin was found at about 23 a.m. in Bridal Veil.
She had hurt her knee, and she had fallen and hit her head.
The cops spent the night with a couple, and they were raised up on Monday morning.
Passengers were taken with an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrawn from Luhansk Airport
Ukraine's troops have withdrawn from Luhanski airport.
According to the U.S. Army, the soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the parachute forces have worked hard with the Russian tanks in the field.
According to the military, the counterparty cannon fire has been so precise that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Azovanse Sea, the Ukrainian patrol ship, which received the artwork yesterday, fell in the morning, says the border guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard wasn't sure where the ship was shot.
The Separatists already told me yesterday in the social media that they shot the ship.
According to the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
Mr Lavrov, however, requested that Ukraine's troops immediately retreat into positions from which they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, in the negotiations of Minsk today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE, an immediate ceasefire should be achieved without any conditions.
Mr Lavrov also recalled that Russia should respond to possible new economic sanctions.
Firstly, we will protect our own interests, our economies, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions on the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
The harsh rains caused Malmö and Copenhagen to flood
The streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen, when the harsh rains stabbed South Sweden and Denmark.
The floods cut many roads, mixed traffic, buried cars underneath.
On Sunday, the authorities estimate that the flood may last, even though it was predicted that the rain would cease by Monday.
Strong rains could surprise the Swedish authorities, and no weather warning was given in advance on the rains.
The meteorologist Ari Mustala, a surrogate friend of the Finnish Air Science Institute, estimates that the rainliner that had trouble with the region was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and stable.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French Socialists should "be quiet and help France," Francois Hollande's main supporter says
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to appear to the Socialist Vice President in difficulties with his feelings, whose composition of the new government was not approved by the French majority.
The President deserves all respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our mission is to stay with him," said Valls, and deserved applause.
As a satisfactory gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave peace despite the 35-hour working week in France, despite the proposal of the new Minister of Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, which had previously been adopted this week, to debate, that the rule should be lame.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to work together with the government.
However, the Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubrira, caused disparity by showing a meeting of socialists who have expressed different opinions and criticizing the Socialist Party that it would allow "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, head of the Supreme National Front, mocked the continual separation of the socialists and said that faith in the new government of the Vallis would not last a few months longer.
Francois Hollande may have gone to the war, but also Manuel Valls, whose responsibility was to form a new government after the previous one did not even last for the summer.
"And the new government won't last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to journalists.
He reiterated his party's proposal for the dismantling of the Parliament and held the victory of his party in premature elections, and he himself would be willing to lead the party.
The French governing party suffered a crushing death in the municipalities of March, and the extreme right was held on the list in the May EU elections.
According to the Journal du Dimanche survey on Sunday, 76 per cent of the French believes that the Socialist Party may break into a number of competing groups before the end of the Dutch season in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, political researcher at the Po University, warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist government would not succeed in improving the economy and recording unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that the change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Pokka deceived the morning Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and Meteorologist Pekka Pouda failed the program at the uncovered part of the program.
Morning Finland Program published a fun video of the recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook website last Thursday.
With video players Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahkola as well as meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record the morning of the next day’s posting of the Finnish advertising puff, but the recording is not going to be completely piped.
In his words, Alm-Sira is confused when she tries to say the word on the budget row, and her craving also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose her cheeks once and for all.
And these heroes should be allowed to take a direct transmission until tomorrow, the morning is stated in the Finnish Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both attracted and distributed more than 10,000 times on Facebook.
In 1972, Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the paper photo office, was thirdly placed in a series of potrets.
It's a picture of Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A socialist international meeting was held in May 1971 at the building champions' house in Fredrikinka, Helsinki.
There were many Heads of State at the meeting, and security was huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went along.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we received a lot of five minutes to describe.
I took this picture four feet away.
The light and background were right.
Right away, I realized I did it this time.
From the look of the Meir, you can see that the leaders of the Middle East have had a hard time before.
Then, in the competition, pictures of known people or events were taken.
It is wonderful that you can succeed with other pictures today, as long as there is an idea and visual torch.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best picture is that Lasse Virén falls from the München Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Argument: Aarnio already paid more than EUR 5 million
Research into the legality of the Helsinki Police Drug Unit has already cost more than EUR 5 million and demanded 30 to 50 persons' years of employment.
This is what Jiri Rajamäki assessed in the dissertation of information technology by the University of Jyväskylä.
The border turbulence suggests that the control of the lawfulness of police activities and the fight against crime could be significantly improved by combining the IT systems for investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to the border, modern technology enables multiple use of criminal material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system where the information to be collected for the purposes of the crime is automatically compliant with the evidence chain and at the same time allows for comprehensive legality control.
The allegation will be inspected on Saturday.
Hole: The 1999 concept of vegetable food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken food belonging to growth diet"
A picture of the special information on the walls of the school for the turbulent women’s trip caused food in the social media, says Yle’s website.
The vegetarians!
Vegetable diet included fish and chicken foods in the school lunch.
Only when there's meat on the list will we make a vegetarian option!
This is the case in the 15 - year - old newsletter that was forgotten on the school wall.
You'll be able to see the picture from here.
The image spread in the social media has brought people to the city of Pirkkala to send intimidated feedback.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleanliness Service, notes to Yle that the paper that was forgotten on the wall is not correct and should have been deleted.
Obviously, before my arrival, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been debated with health care.
Each pupil gets a meal that he wants, he says to Yle.
This day, in Pirkkala schools, students will be offered a variety of vegetarians only with the permission of parents and a certificate from a doctor or nurse of herbal foods.
Hazard justifies the solution to Yle because young people’s vegetarian experiments may leave food shortages and the absence of meat or chicken can cause a surprise from the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise near the $3 billion Prestige Cruise agreement
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, is taking negotiations to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. The information comes from people close to the matter.
With this trade, the Norwegian Cruise company, which has a market value of $6.8 billion, would be able to make use of Luxury Riders and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises as it continues to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information on the possible agreement may already be published this week, although it is also possible that negotiations do not result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private venture capital company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 % of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names to be public because negotiations were not held in public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the requests for comments and Apollo’s representative refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company in Miami has 13 cruise ships covering the route map of North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover grew by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when the turnover was EUR 2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, who operates so far from Miami, is a wall with Oceania and Regent brand names, including eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavian, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was USD 1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
A cruise industry worth $29 billion is expected to benefit from the increase in the average grades of emerging economies, such as China and India, in the coming years.
Companies compete in order to be the first option for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first release of shares in the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares after the sale of 2007, with a value of $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in its current composition in 2000 with its merged Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) rising company. The latter is Lim Kok Thay's entertainment and casino company, the Maltese billionaire.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the disclosures, Genting’s share of the company was 28 %, Apollo was 20% and the share of the private capital investment company SGG Capital LP was 8 % from the end of June.
The total number of Cruises companies in Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise accounts for 82 % of the cruise capacity in North America, as shown in the registration document published by Prestige Cruise.
The City Government of Tampere is dealing with this today.
Anima wishes to firmly support the city government's initiative.
According to Salla Juimivara, the director of animalia, preparing a doctorate to the University of Tampere, there is a need to end quickly during dolphins in Finland and around the world.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there has been a general view that the concentration of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is neither animal protection nor ethically sustainable.
This view should also be brought to Tampere.
The abolition of the delfinarian is not only a question of animal law, but also a question of Tampere's imago as a tourist destination, which the Court would point out.
According to the judiciary, the death of the Vissi-delphin confirms the demands for the downstream dolphin activity.
I see death is sad to continue to the dark history of the Shirley Dolfinary.
It is time to put a point in the deaths, close the dolphin prison, and begin to find out how the Tampere dolphins could be moved to a restricted sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, a judge risk is required.
The vision did not experience a return to the original living environment of dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in the Shirley Mine may experience even more than the infinite concrete, the Criminal Hazard hopes.
The Animal Protection Union Animalia aims to prohibit the use of all wildlife species in circuss in the overall reform of the preparatory animal protection legislation.
This includes dolphins.
In support of this requirement, Director of Action of Animalia Judges will participate in today's demonstration on behalf of the dolphins held on 9 September.
The Japanese embassy in Helsinki takes a position against the dolphin hunting period in Japan.
During the hunting period, approximately 2300 dolphins are arrested or brutally killed each year, either for the use of dolphins or for food.
Putin calls for Kiev to open negotiations on the new state with Eastern Ukraine
On Sunday, President of Russia, Vladimir Putin requested that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the eastern parts of the country and immediately start negotiations on the 'state state' of the dissolution area, reports from Russian news sources.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the region of the Eastern Ukraine controlled by the Separatists would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's demand to the Government of Kiev to negotiate with Russian-minded rebels as equivalent negotiating partners meets his obvious strategy since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help the separatists to take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to give the recently declared Novorossija autonomy, which enables it to move towards Russia instead of the West.
In the interview on Channel 1 of the State, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to regain the region of the eastern Donetsk and Luhanski controlled by the separatists, which was conquered by the separatists in March and April by Moscow attached to the Ukrainian Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently drowned the region into "Novorossia", "New Russia" – this term resembles the days of the great revolutions of the Russian government.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace talks are a "future" as long as the Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for the parliamentary elections held on 26 October and the government forces are attacking civilians in the areas controlled by the separatists.
"We need to start extensive negotiations immediately, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the position of the South-Eastern Ukraine State, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to 'nationality' relates to a broader independence, which has been debated with the leadership of Kiev for months in attempting to disarm the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the Eastern regions the independence they need, says Peskov.
There cannot be any debate on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, 'cause this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it is an internal conflict in Ukraine'.
The interim remark by the representative of Kremlin, which was designed to correct Putin's remarks as a 'fair interpretation', stressed that the Russian government deals with the rebellion of the Eastern Seaparatics in a different way than in the case of Crimea, when it, in practice, dominated the region of which the majority of the population of 2 million people are ethnicly Russians.
It would be considerably more difficult for Moscow to join even the areas of Donetsk or Luhanski in Eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnicly Russians and because, according to the pre-conflict opinion surveys, the majority of the population were in favour of staying in Ukraine.
Independence on which Russian diplomats have discussed in international fora would give the local authorities in Ukraine the right to agree themselves on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin practically the power in a region that connects to the Russian Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was attached to Russia five months ago, is located in the Russian main fleet and in the ports of commercial maritime transport and historical coastal destinations.
The area between Russia and Crimea also has mines, factories and metal alloys that produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, the President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions outside Ukraine's nuclear area on their own economy and the position of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from the viewpoint of the Separatists perhaps armed by Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made its latest demands to the Government of Kiev on negotiations with Russian-minded rebels in equal terms after the rebels went further last week after the Russian tanks and troops invaded Eastern Ukraine earlier from a peaceful region on the coast of the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian security authorities are afraid that taking over the city of Novoazovski, the separatists supported by Russia, is the beginning of a greater effort to regain the entire strategic coastal area until the Crimea.
It has led to the strengthening of the city of Maripoli, a massive civilian and military staff. Mariupol, half a million inhabitants, is known as a steel-producing port city located between the cape land that leads to the Novoazowski and the Krim peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels, asking for further measures to prevent Russia from coming offences in Ukraine, the former Republic of the Soviet Union, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point without return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of strange soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take any decisions on direct action; the leaders put forward additional sanctions in order to bring them into practice if the crisis in Ukraine is re-launched in unambiguous circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their position in the Ilovaisk region after the move of the two Russian armor departments and 1 000 soldiers last week to the Donetsk territory in order to confirm the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, informed the suppliers on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 soldiers in Ukraine in Ilovaisk, Russia, was replaced with 10 Russian parachutes, which were captured in Ukraine a week ago.

Australian Publications and Gabi Grecko in Nakedian Scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he may have been frightened by hackers stolen by his fiancée and the naked images of Gabi Grecko, the Hollywood list star A.
In the entertainment world, a number of Jennifer Lawrence's naked images were published on the Internet as a result of a wide-ranging screening scandal.
Hacker has been told to have a total of 60 naked-game star Lawrence and other superstars, such as Kate Upton and Cara Delevinnes, a singer from Rihana, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as an actor from Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko in Melbourne have also been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
The list has 101 celebrities' names.
Edelsten, who asked Grecko last month, said to the Confidential magazine, "This is disgusting."
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is shameful that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
In New York, Greckon is reported with a comment on the case in the web magazine 'safe' and said that the victims are feeling ashamed.
Hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with this last boyfriend, Scott Speedman, including two samples of Palmer on the top of the pool.
Palmer's film shows include the movie Love and Honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the Chuck series Strahovski and the Sucker Punch actor Browning didn't comment on hacked images yesterday.
Lawrence's representative said to the TMZ magazine, "it's a big offence in violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen got angry at the hacker in his twitter: "The publication of stolen images does not differ in any way from the sale of the stolen product".
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, not just from a legal point of view.
