Changes in corporate support policies - Province - Regions - News - Karjalinen
In addition to EU corporate support, the management of national corporate aid will also be concentrated on four life centres from mid-September.
In Eastern Finland, the South Savo Ely Centre is responsible for activities in Mikkeli.
According to the new company aid law at the beginning of July, EU Structural Funds aid should no longer be allocated to large enterprises unless it is a whole new operation.
The subsidiaries of municipalities with more than five thousand inhabitants are also counted as large municipalities.
Instead, EU support can continue to be granted for investment that improves the economic conditions of municipalities.
In eastern Finland, about 30 people will receive the strength of the EU and national aid management unit.
At least so far, they will all continue their work in their current establishments.
For example, Kalevi Pölöse, head of the Structural Funds unit of the South Savo Ely Centre, is in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is now seeking for in Ukraine
Russia acts consistently, even if it does not always look like it.
Director of the Faculty of Defence College, Colonel, Docent Torsti Siren was not surprised by the controversial news of the Monday morning in Ukraine.
This has been the same thing for a long time, says Siren.
On the other hand, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanded an immediate cease-fire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more from here).
On the other hand, Ukraine says that its parachute forces are currently fighting the Russian tank department near the Luhanski airport, and that the tank department has received reinforcements (read more here).
Mr Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire in Minsk's negotiations without any conditions.
Russia disputes its involvement and must immediately reach the outcome of the negotiations so that they can have their consolidated position in Luhanski and Donetsk.
There's the whole plan, Siren says.
This is the big pattern: it is urgent to start negotiating, and it is precisely so that Russia gets its own power to the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Finnair exhibits cabin services to the Norwegian company, holidays people
Finnair begins to buy cabin services as subcontracting from the Norwegian crew company OSM Aviation.
The first step of the agreement is to deal with the routes of Finnair and Singapore, but it will be extended later.
The externalisation of the two routes leads to a reduction of approximately 100 working years in Finland, which will be implemented at first stage by holidays, the company reported in its communications.
In addition, some 80 Asian rental workers will cease their work at the time the routes are extern.
Finnair already told in June that it intends to extern about 20 routes of cabin services over the next two years.
Exclusions were concluded when no agreement was reached with the staff on savings.
Foreignisations are planned to start next year in January-March.
According to the company, the negotiations on cooperation will also be continued with other partner candidates.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of neuronal back pain, i.e. stroke, for those who work hard.
For 13 years, firemen were monitored in the study of the occupational health service.
The connection of sleep disorders to the scotch tree is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and endurance of firemen, which are regularly tested, does not seem to protect the pain, says the research director, doctrine Sirpa Lusa in the Health Department.
The work of firemen is an irregular shift where the shifts can be stretched up to 24 hours.
According to the occupational health service, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey carried out in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you know the surprising new causes of water injury?
Easy to cause destruction to other dwellings
Water damage Water damage is not at all caused by leaking pipes or sharks, reminds us of an expert in the gastronomy.
We have received contacts when the breach of the aquarium has caused a water injury in the household company, whether aquariums are possible to be banned, says Marina Furusolm, the legal expert in the gastronomy.
The fusion software reminds us that only pipes and sewers are not the general cause of water damage, but nowadays also more and more new machinery such as freezers have caused water leaks in housing.
Many do not know that machines such as a washing machine or washing machine must not be left uncontrolled.
The water stove must also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, because otherwise the pressure in the pipes may lead to a water leak.
The person may be considered guilty of negligence if these obligations have been negligent, in which case liability for damage is the person.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance may compensate for damage, depending on the terms and the case of the insurance.
If it can be demonstrated that the resident has caused careless damage, the person is liable for liability.
If the resident has passed a shower on a floor well, negligence can often be proven, as in these cases the water has been flooded elsewhere and the serviceman comes to the apartment where the deceased resident is found.
The furnishing software tells us that because of the increase in the pressure on the floor wells, two floor wells are now installed in many student housings.
Water damage has also been caused by waterbeds, although not to the extent they used to be more popular.
Even the dog’s water cup and the fall of home wine can become real water damage.
I also know the case where there were many cats in the apartment that had poured on the floors so far that there was a huge damage, the Furo-Soulm tells me.
The principle of rehabilitation is always the same if the company’s statute does not determine otherwise.
The shareholder is responsible for the repair of the surface material and the damage to the structure of the house company and the damage to other housings.
Water damage is easy to destroy other dwellings because the structure of concrete is very easily absorbed by water.
According to the flush program, the batteries in the apartments are particularly difficult because the batteries are easily smuggling into structures.
Water damages can today be caused by generalised air temperature pumps that produce condensation water.
Water should lead to a solid sewer or a rainwater network, not just a container.
It is also the responsibility of the shareholder to remove water, snow, ice and garbage from the balcony, advised by a legal expert.
The furnishing software provides that, although the rules of the household company do not require, for example, a solid decommissioning of the washing machine, the insurance may provide a condition for which compensation is not granted for this reason.
You should be careful with your own home insurance conditions.
However, I consider the irrigated water drainage pipes of the washing machines, for example, to be a major risk that has caused many damage.
I recommend that the decommissioning products always be permanently wired into the sewerage pipeline.
Deletion of snow and water with balcony
Washing machine, washing machine, etc. control of machinery, while on.
Closure of water hammers (washing machine and dishwasher)
Cleaning of the floor well in an apparent way twice a half a year.
The recommendation is to firmly connect the removal products to the sewer.
Check the hans and their potential leaks
Regular freezer melting
Do you have any experience with water damage?
Tell me about your experience in a commentary period?
FC Honka lost again and embraced as a serial jumbo.
At Tapiola's sports park, on Sunday night, two of the weakest teams were encountered by the Contemporary League of Vocabulary at this moment.
FC Honka, last celebrated the victory in June, hosted seven games in an invincible pipe of the Vaasa Ball Society.
VPS has just received Honka's previous victory in July.
The meeting with the Espoo team on Sunday came to a good stair, as VPS returned for a long time to the winning table with readings of 2-1.
Chief coach Olli Huttunen complained about the inefficiency of his team before the game, but the confusional Honka Defense facilitated VPS's painting problems.
A game of very nervous performance.
We didn't get any longer attacks at all, we couldn't hold the ball," Huttunen estimates the performance of his own.
In the first half of the time, Milos Milovic, Honga's top pair, Manev played very uncertainly.
Both Vasian paints were born as a result of the loose play of the toppers.
The opening painting of the match was only seen after five minutes of the game, when Steven Morrissey directed Sebastian Strandvall's shot by Walter Viitala, a fooled Honka painter.
I'm sorry for the first half.
By the field, the team did the opposite of the agreement before the game," Shefki Kuqi was the head coach of Honga.
After the start of the shock, the Espolias had their games together and turned the ball on the attack.
Especially the middle-field player Carlos Portela and the league Roni Porokara were eagerly searching for worksplaces, but the last solutions were almost repeatedly miserable.
The closest finishing was the central fieldman of Honga, Jussi Vasara, whose shot from 20 metres was a little past VPS.
The VPS was effective against him using his vike attackers and Honga's messy topparpari.
At half an hour, the vassians made a 2-0 shot when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart got through the two of us.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was a good player during the opening period and created repeated situations on the left side.
Stewart's speed again seemed to be too much for the Espoo Defence throughout the game.
"In half time, if we lose, we lose with honor," Kuqi told me.
Incredibly searched for mining paint during the second period.
The team was two times close to the hit until the third company succeeded.
Yerai Vilaboa, who's a pimp, finished the goal in the middle of the sanctuary area.
After Vilaboa's goal, Honga had half an hour to set the fight.
The Espoo team took more and more risks, giving VPS the opportunity to attack dangerously.
Stewart and Morrissey both got back together with the Viita, but the home team was involved in the fight with the home team.
For the rest, Honka was a little tired and did not get any more elections for time.
With the death, Honka embraced the Beast League for the last time there are seven more matches left.
Page: Putin threatens to take over Kiev in two weeks
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, was quite harsh in a telephone discussion with the President of the EU Commission, José Manuel Barroso, reports the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
Mr Putin expressed his irritation about the European Union's plans to tighten up sanctions against Russia.
If I want to, I can take over Kiova in two weeks, La Repubblica tells me that Putin said.
According to the newspaper, Putin's message to Barroso was this: it is not worth irritating Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave an interview to the Russian TV One channel on the Ukraine crisis on Sunday night.
Putin said that he was holding the conflict fully within Ukraine and calling on the Government of Kiev to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev very much about the launch of civilian targets in Eastern Ukraine.
Russia's "can't be seen next door" if people are shot dead from close range, Putin said.
Esko Roine acknowledges: The work of the actor destroyed the family
The hard work of the Conkarinatist and the theater family raised recognition of the fact that the actor's profession destroyed his first marriage.
The actor Esko Roine is going to be 70 next Friday, but in his case, I think it's a valid saying that age is just a number.
I don't see any difference compared to a year ago or two years ago or ten years ago.
It looks like the mental puberty continues, says Esko Roine.
Roine's been retired for years, but she's still working for a lot of men.
Sometimes a joke was that there weren't many plays in this country without Esko Roinetta.
At the moment, Roinee has roles in the play of the City Theatre in Helsinki How to succeed in business, the Working People's Teatter's Intellectualist, as well as the Tampere Kommedia Theatre Quartet.
Roine will also be seen in the future Risto Raptor film.
RIGHT: Reijo Hietanen
Roine's actor career didn't start promisingly.
I didn't like a tiger boy shot at school.
40-50 years later, the teacher said it was because I was so bad.
Esko Roine didn't get discouraged.
The choice of your career was clear, there was no choice.
It seemed close and loved.
I was so busy that I left school and volunteered to the army just to get to the theater school as soon as possible.
Roine has done about 200 theatre roles and 300 TV shows a little depending on how to calculate.
If the work is calculated like the angelsmanns, that every part of the TV series is its own show, there are more than 600 TV cases.
I was three years in a new day, three episodes a week.
The other spring, I was killed when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments to autumn 2016
The big sisters of Esko Eila, 83, and Lisa, 76, are in a full strike and make the Tampere Working Team Theatre still in the play of the fierce roles as an anarchist monkeys.
Little brother's probably running on stage for years.
That's what it looks like, but you don't know about this age.
I always have to make a small reservation, if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar will have reservations for the autumn of 2016.
It's been years since they left their marks on the man.
Age doesn't come alone.
The knees have been operated, the hip is whispering and arthritis is troubled, but when you don't let it get too disturbed, yes, these will get you, Esko Roine says.
The TV audience, Roine, was familiar with a number of people.
It's a pirate radio, and some kind of scattering he and Antti Einio distributed hundreds of dollars, and a hundred dollars of bills.
It was Antti Einio who distributed hundreds.
I was trying to thirsty that they were rainy and not rainy.
In the Reinikaine series, Roine was frustrated by Lieutenant Rautakallio.
He became the favorite of the Tampere police officers at the facility when he happened to be working on the same level.
A policeman stopped the car on the street, took the window open and yelled at me, "It's a great railroad."
Workgroup Successful
From the theatres to Roine's mind, they've been left in mind, for example.
Producer and Master Class of the City Theatre in Helsinki, the death of the Working Team Theatre Trafficker and the long-day trip to Tampere Theatre.
It has to do with the fact that the performances have been popular.
It's not my fault, it's the task force that's been successful.
There are also Riman missions.
Pekka Pu Kopf's role in the movie is one of those.
There are others.
It's because I've agreed too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the result is not for myself or for the viewers.
As an actor, you can't choose your own work.
It's just kindly done what's been told.
In addition to the theater work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the '80s, he had a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was a teaching experience.
It became nothing when I tried to be the director of Tampere's Teater, an actor, and then a diner.
If I really remember, within a year, it became clear that these can't be reconciled with any of them.
Typically, when the show was in the end or in the middle of time, and I was already able to wonder if I would put it on the sauna, the restaurant became a call, that there were friends of yours who hoped to see you after the show.
Reminds for Birthday
On his birthday, Esko Roinee shows memories, as ghost writers Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
Some kind of pigeon they've made out of the face-to-face memory.
When I was playing in Zoom, I was called a facial manipulator.
No, they don't know me. They don't know me.
The book has been made for years.
Roine used to tell me that no news bombs are promised, because he hasn't done anything so dirty, or if he does, he won't tell us.
I made a little first sentence in the book.
I'm saying that if someone waits for scandals or good gossips, you should stop reading to this.
There's a lot to do with the profession, as an actor as a theater leader.
The publisher’s body is that there is also a tour of a hilarious theatre student.
It was a pretty normal student life, but as a kid, all kinds of tricks had to be done.
It wasn't as bad as it was at Turkey's time.
It was very different.
I don't know how much more I got out of there than self-confirmed that when the school has gone so well, I know that it's at least not up to it if it doesn't heal.
I didn't have to think how good I would have been if I had gone to school.
Roine also remembers the legends of the National Theatre.
I got friends with Pentti Simes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Häyrise and got to work with them.
Well, there were legends from my first step-by-law, Karlo Holdtus.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him when I was in school.
The middle of the fire, Martti, was in the same class as me.
At the theater school, Roine met her first wife Marjukka Halttunen.
He remembers his divorce as a painful thing.
After a relatively long battle, the children were distributed.
Not in two parts, but in a way that my daughter went to my mother and a son to me.
I didn't think it was a good solution, and I believe that children are quite in agreement now as adults.
It's not rare in the theater circles to put silver in pieces.
In the case of us, some part was that I was working quite a lot too.
I was in the theater almost every case.
Then there was a TV and a radio on it.
I did a long day and a family life was suffering.
Maybe on the party nights.
Esko Roine celebrates Tampere at the Working People's Teater on September 7.
The celebration will continue at the City Theatre in Helsinki on 21 and 28 September.
And there's a mind-destructor, too.
I was 50 years old at work and sixtys at work.
When such a easy-to-mobile play happened, I thought that we'd be holding the seventies now, and we'd get them out of one row.
Roinene says there's no celebrations on the actual birthday.
I remember it's free night, but I'm not going to swear.
I might've bumped a job for that day.
Or maybe it's a weird night off I'm going to have a night off, says Roine.
Aeronautical companies are concerned about the production chain
Some of the smaller aircraft manufacturers in Britain are concerned that the production capacity problems in the supply chain may be deteriorating the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase the production of passenger aircraft.
In Britain, thousands of companies in the production chain of aircraft production currently enjoy the unexpected amount of aircraft and motor development plans to be carried out at the same time.
Aviation and defence
At the same time as some enjoy the order room, there have been warnings about capacity problems and price pressure at the hands of the production chain.
"It is absolutely true that there is a price pressure, especially now that the production volume poses challenges," says Craig Gallagher, Director-General of MB Aerospace, who is one of the main suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
David Bailey, Managing Director of North West Aerospace Alliance, representing the supplier of North West Aerospace Aerospace Aerospace Alliance, says that more capacity is needed.
"Do strategies and investment plans respond to these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure about that.
Above all, we need more investment in new production equipment and machinery needed to enable these production volumes to be implemented," says Gallagher.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft buildings are part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchill, the CEO of JJ Churchill, producing gas turbine wings, the company has a "destructive time", when several new construction plans started to be implemented at the beginning of the year.
We switched into a very small production situation where production capacity exceeded.
Many orders were paid only later, and we had to try to push forward.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans," says Churchill.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing 800 000 pounds in new machines and hiring 26 new workers.
A number of industry actors believe that investment and cooperation between small suppliers is needed if the UK wishes to maintain its position as the second largest operator in the aviation sector after the United States.
Ford Aerospace, Chairman of the Ford Aerospace company and Tynesid’s fine-mechanic engineer, Geoff Ford, says that the order sum should increase the confidence and desire of producers and increase production capacity, as work needs to be sufficient.
"If this doesn't happen, we lose in competition against other countries," says Ford.
A few large players are trying to solve the problem by obtaining capacity.
Senior purchased UPECA, which manufactured parts of aeroplanes and motor noses of the FTSE 250 index, with 75 million pounds.
Last year, MB Aerospace bought companies in North America and Poland.
"It is possible to buy new business start-ups that create new activities, but in reality, production is slowed by the limitation of design and the number of engineers," says Gallagher MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has moved from the large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engineers.
Some believe that the problems of the production chain operators are exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, head of the GKN Aeroplane Production Unit, who also operates as well as the UK ATM trade, considers that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous periods.
There is pressure in the supply chain, but I would not describe the situation as critical.
"The introduction of new technologies and advanced processes is more important than that," says Bryson.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned from errors and are now more careful in order to not increase the number of buildings too quickly.
As Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it was faced with major difficulties when the company lost, and the factories and the chain of production fought to survive.
Tony Wood, head of the Rolls Royce Aeroplanes production unit, says that the company has not yet encountered problems in the production chain that delivers most of the 18 000 parts of the aircraft's engine.
"Tie will certainly be clumsy, but we believe that we have done more thorough work in the supply chain by choosing the best partners and by keeping contact with suppliers when preparing for more activity," says Wood.
According to Boeing's CEO James McNerney, the company's production chain has had time to prepare for the increase in supply volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the chain of production.
We have been open to suppliers, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, CEO of the Airbus Passenger Shuttle Production Unit, says that the company will do everything in its power to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of A350 to 10 machines per month by 2018.
"Maybe one of the suppliers will not succeed, and it is our job to try to prevent this situation and to support suppliers and find alternatives, but there are great problems to wait," says Brégier.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for sin suits: "The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the editor.
So this is the work of me and Airbus."
Hong Kong protest teams start the "Eyes of Citizens' Intelligence" in Beijing for open elections
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Democracy supports activists are spreading on Hong Kong's streets after rejecting the requirements for their open elections in China.
Democratic groups in Hong Kong emphasise that demonstrations can mark and swear to ensure that the age of "unfitness of citizens" begins in the city in order to oppose the elections proposed by the Chinese Government.
Thousands of demonists protested against the coming raining horizon in Hong Kong when they traveled to the demonstration of the Occupy Central Democratic Group in front of the Council's premises for the implementation of the laws on Sunday night, where demonstrators urged people to take part in a large seated demonstration to degrade the city's financial district.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it would prohibit the right of voters to propose publicly candidates at the mayorial elections held in 2017, threatening the monthly demonstrations that increase the dual age of the city.
Interesters participate in the beginning of the Occupy Central demonstration in front of the main government buildings in Hong Kong.
"We want fair and proper elections," says Dion Tse, a 24-year-old web site manager, who participated in a Sunday demonstration with his 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-y.
The government has no respect for the voice of the Hong Kong people.
We want the government to listen to us and see the resoluteness of the Hong Kong people.
The Chinese National Assembly, which governs the highest law in China, approved the plans for electoral change, allowing only two three candidates to take part in the first direct elections in Hong Kong.
However, the proposal is requested by the Billing Committee of 1200 spirits, and the opposition politicians believe that this will prevent the choice of political opinions that differ effectively.
The speakers participate in the demonstration organised in the context of the Occupy Central Love and Peace Protest, which was carried out in Tamar Park before the government building in Hong Kong.
According to police estimates, more than 2,600 people were currently involved in the demonstration.
A large number of cops followed when about 100 demonstrators led by the Scholarism study group gathered late on Sunday for Grand Hyatt, where Li Fein, a member of the Communist Party, had to stay overnight after his arrival in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Occupy Central, attended a press conference with members of Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students.
However, in order to comply with the law, the exact date on which the road blocking was carried out, the participants were urged to monitor the development of the situation "in the next couple of weeks" and to add that the city is officially switching to the "time of the non-citizens' inquiry".
Benny or answer the press questions.
"Look at the person next to you," he said in a Sunday demonstration, in front of a advertisement displaying two figures of disobedience in China.
That man overpowers the center with you!
Joshua Wong, 17-year-old celebrations representing Scholarism, said earlier that the preparations for the demonstrations of high school students are ongoing and are designed to be maintained at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to show their minds by refusing to teach.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility," says Wong.
In Beijing, Vice-President Li Fei, Vice-President of the Committee of the People's Congress, told the journalists that the defence of the general right of voting "international requirements" is "time loss" and comes from some of the Hong Kong politicians who seek to "mix society and mislead it".
"In practice proposals such as the nomination of a candidate have spent a lot of time," Li says, in demanding that the choice should be created in such a way that it fits the real situation and the legislative framework of each society.
The general legislative initiative on voting rights can only be adopted if the large majority, i.e. two thirds of the 70 spirit legislative body in Hong Kong, supports that means that 27 opposition members of the government can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong might be distracted into a prolonged political debate if the reform proposal was rejected by veto law.
"That would be a problem for business and urban development," he says.
Nearly 800 000 people voted in an informal survey organised by the Occupy Central movement in June in order to oppose China's demands.
Up to 172 000 people marched for democracy on 1 July, while the march against Beijing and against the Occupy Central on 17 August attracted some 88 000 participants.
Three wounded lightning attacks on the shore of New York City
In a lightning attack on a shore in New York, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, men were injured on the Orchard Beach beach in Pelham Bay on Sunday night in the Bronx, when heavy storms crossed the area.
Injured men are in hospital care.
The extent of the injuries is unknown.
The lightning hit when the heavy storms would wipe out the city.
The storm rains, the thunder and the lightning interrupted the Labor Day weekend and the U.S. Open Tennis game in Queens, and forced the music festival to close early on East River Island.
Ten commercial flights to city airports were late because of bad weather.
It's not a new idea to please.
This is the latest guide for the employees and managers of the network users, and it is distributed by Harvey Schachter, the writer of the Monday Morning Manager website.
According to Entrepreneur Seth Godin, it's a good idea to identify comments like "I don't like it" or "I don't understand."
If this is not the case, the idea is probably popular and obvious — so boring and everyday — or the benefits that it brings are so small that it is not worth reaching.
As a historian, Drew Gilpin of Harvard never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think that he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as the principal of the university, he repeats the same thing several times so that the message can be received widely.
Advertising consultant Bob Hoffman thinks TV and radio are the best means to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people read the news on the network does not mean that the Internet is a good commercial – just as the first phone was a popular communication tool but a bad option for advertisers.
The psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson points out that motivation for workers is enough for one word: together.
One study told the participants that they would solve the problem in cooperation, even though they actually worked alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and solved more problems than those who were not told at the beginning of the cooperation.
If the task is to find a recurring pattern or relationship between the two units, the performing expert Dave Paradi advises you to forget Microsoft SmartArt and instead use the Diagrammer.com program, where you can choose between 14 different relationships.
Emergency surgeries at Mount Stuart Hospital banal due to safety risk
The specialised doctor has been temporarily separated from his office, and NHS, the UK National Health System, ceased to direct patients to diagnostic surgery in that private hospital after the hospital’s problems came up.
Two people came to Torbay’s hospital after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon has said that he had contacts with 19 patients treated on July 26 and invited them to "a fast clinical study".
The Mount Stuart Hospital regretted the matter and said that it had been investigated since the doctor's divorce.
It came to Torbay’s hospital when two patients who were treated in Mount Stuart were requested for emergency medical care due to eye problems.
According to Torbay’s hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients who were all investigated on the same day had to undergo a repair operation.
The Torbay Hospital and the South Devon and Torbay Hospital have not directed patients to treat Mount Stuart since the emergence of problems.
David Sinclair, temporary director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation, leading the Torbay Hospital, said: "We have identified the problem at the beginning and we were able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Every time we direct patients to the service provider, we perform quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its authorisations are in order.
According to Gill Gant, the head of the South Devon and Torbay Hospital Health Department, "patient safety is always an absolute number of patients, so it is important that these echo surgery are not carried out until we can be absolutely sure that the treatment is safe".
The Ramsay Health Care UK company in charge of the Mount Stuart Hospital called for "indefinitely apologise to all patients who had complications".
The company was reported that "One of the day we found out about the possible problem, we and later the Torbay hospital called to all the patients involved".
This specialist has been authorised to treat Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been registered as a doctor since 1989.
To date, he has completed 4 537 echo surgery in different parts of the organisation. According to statistics, the clinical results of his cuts have been excellent and the complication rate has been less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been temporarily suspended until the matter has been investigated.
What's "4chan"?
The Pahamaine anonymous communication site published naked images of celebrities as the first time
What exactly is "4chan", and why was it the first option for the hacker when he published stolen images?
"4chan" was established in 2003.
The site is divided into several sections, so called notification tables, where anonymous users can discuss all possible, video games and travel to porn and hack.
Unlike other online forums, users do not create a single, continuous profile and their publications are not stored.
On the most popular reporting tables, comments may be lost in less than a minute, when newer publications are distracted by them in the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchical and surprising creative atmosphere.
Members of an anonymous functioning community have created some of the most well-known measures of the network (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats"), but the absence of rules on the site has also led to a lot of questioning or direct criminal content on the site.
The site’s most popular notification table is /b/ which is intended for mixed discussions and which regularly displays the NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
This may contain tasty porn, but also raw and shocking images. An anonymous hacker published the stolen images of celebrities this weekend.
The American CytRx invests in research and development of cancer medicines
The aim of the CytRx company is to cure cancer – or at least slow it down.
A biologic company in Los Angeles, a company who had been targeted a long time ago as a result of the sale of shares, has specialised in the research and development of cancer medicines.
The most promising medicine is aldoxorubicin, which is a more advanced form of doxorubicin used in chemotherapy.
CytRx conducts clinical trials with aldoxorubicin in the treatment of soft tissueosarcoma, Kaposin sarcoma associated with AIDS and renewable glioblastomas or brain tumours.
It is like a controlled missile that goes directly to the tumor and not to any other body, says Steven Kriegsma’s CEO of the CytRx company’s cancer drug from aldoxorubicin.
My aldoxorubicin contains so-called compound technology that works like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to a protein in the blood, which is also accumulated into tumours, resulting in direct transfer of the medicine to cancer cells.
The association will give the medicine only in an acidic environment, or cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue.
This technology allows the patient to receive more and more cancer medicines at multiple doses.
"It's like a missile that goes directly to the tumor and not to any other body," says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of the CytRx company.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on the development of medicines, CytRx does not win.
The company sold the shares this year, thus collecting $86 million for the maintenance of operations and research.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide for a crucial phase 3 clinical trial for alternative treatment of soft tissues.
The soft tissue rhythm is a type of cancer that develops in soft tissues such as blood vessels, muscles and fat tissues.
Alternative therapy is used to treat cancer when initial therapy does not result in results.
If the clinical study is successful, CytRx is planning to apply for authorisation from the US food and medications management site already in 2016, Kriegsman says.
The medicine could then be adopted in 2017.
Analyticals say that data published in December from a previous clinical trial with CytRx showed that aldoxorubicin is a promising treatment for soft tissue sarcoma.
"For a long time, the question was: "We have not seen the clinical information that it differs from the medication itself," says Andrew Fein, analyst of the H. C. Wainwright & Co. investment company.
The publication of the results confirmed the opinion of many that this treatment is different.
Fein, however, says that it is difficult to predict the results and the timetable of the current clinical study, because it differs significantly from the previous study that was good results.
"All things have to go right," he says.
Fein compares the development of medicinal products to the mining industry.
"At first, a lot of money will be invested in finding that one golden vein, and the investment will continue as long as that golden vein is found," he says.
It takes so long for research and development to succeed in commercialising the medicine.
A number of shareholders have called on CytRx to justice because they believe that it gave a better picture of its success.
In the complaints, the company was accused of hiring a DreamTeam Group, which claimed that people were hired to write positive comments on CytRx and another biotechnology company on articles such as Forbes, Seeking Alphan, Motley Fol and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the complaints, the articles did not reveal that companies paid fees to the writers.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that he had removed the articles "which were inconsistent with practice".
Several articles on companies were also removed from other websites.
Mr. Kriegsman refused to comment on the charges.
The company has hired an external lawyer to respond to the complaints.
"I don't have time or energy to focus on this," Kriegsman says.
He believes that the real challenge for CytRx is to find talented workers who are generally seeking employment in biotechnology centres such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is in many sense a wilderness from the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry," he says.
Views of Analyst
The price of CytRx’s shares increased to 8.08 dollars on 10 January and then dropped to less than three dollars in April when the charges for advertising the shares became public.
According to Analyst, the complaints and negative publicity have lowered the price of the shares than their actual value.
"It is regrettable," says Fein, "but I'm not sure if there is any easy way to ignore this thing as long as the concept is valid."
In the name of the law, a cameraman in the series was killed in the middle of a description.
The photographer of the series of real events, also presented in Finland in the name of the Law, died on Tuesday night when he was shot in the middle of the shooting incident.
The cameraman pictured the shooting between the suspected person from the armed robbery of a self-defense police force and a fast-food restaurant when he hit the bullets.
He died of the injuries he had.
According to the TMZ site, the police reported that the person suspected of armed robbery was killed in the shooting incident, along with the cameraman.
The series in the name of the Act, which is included in the first real-tv programmes, has been presented in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been presented on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of an external factor is going to be a crucial role in the court proceedings that have started today on Ulvila's death.
Anneli Aueri is charged with the murder of her husband Jukka S. Lahde in 2006.
Vaasa’s court of law now deals with the case for the second time, as the Supreme Court returned it to the Supreme Court with a new evidence.
The purpose of the court's court's court is that the judgment will still be issued on the side of this year.
Vaasa's court was released by Auer in 2011.
In that case, the court considered that the possibility of an external factor was sufficiently likely.
Attorney General Kalle Kulmala, in his opening speech, told the prosecutor's view of the night of the murder and the facts that rule out the possibility of an outsider.
In our view, the crucial question is whether a outsider has come into the house, which has killed Jukka Lahden Anneli Auer in the way and in time.
It's about the credibility of Anneli Auer's report," he said.
According to the attorney, the Hen Church began a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he would leave home and seek divorce.
At some point, they moved to the kitchen, where Lahti held on to Auer and tried to stop it from leaving.
One of them took a kitchen knife," Kuumala described the events of the night of death on Monday.
According to the prosecution, a number of facts prove that there was no outsider.
For example, there are no voices from the emergency phone recording.
The oldest child of Auer, the daughter of the interrogation, told me that he saw the killer when he left the fireplace door.
The release sentence of 2011 of Vaasa’s court was partly based on the daughter’s report.
According to the prosecution, the daughter's observation cannot be correct.
"The daughter didn't see the outside person in the parents' bedroom, even though she went there twice," Kulmala said.
The prosecution's new witness has just been linked to the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahde's sister has told me what happened since the night she was murdered in the hospital.
According to the woman, she only told me at the hospital that she saw Lahde's body when she went to the fireplace.
Mr Auer's defense intends to present to the court investigation lines, which, according to the defence, have not been sufficiently established by the police.
When Vaasa’s court was released three years ago from Auer’s prosecution, the court had to hold the visitor’s dna as one of the references to the external author.
The sample later proved to be a researcher at the Central Criminal Police Laboratory Dna.
That's when a sample of 700 people was taken as a massage.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded," Defense lawyer Juha Manner said.
One of the new witnesses of the defense reports about a possible external factor.
The Ulvilian woman told the police about a man who had confessed the act by a woman.
The police interrogated him in the summer.
The prosecution has decided that the man of the Porilism had nothing to do with murder.
A woman's attorney requested an investigation because the prosecution suspects that she was lying in her report.
One of the new witnesses of the defense is a nurse who worked the night of his death at the centre of the Satany Hospital.
The Court of First Instance sentenced Auer to lifelong imprisonment for murder last December.
According to the Court of Justice, Auer’s children’s reports, the voices of the external factor missing from the emergency centre, and the time required for the costs of the events, were fought against the possibility of an external author.
The judgment came with 2-1.
The judge who was in the minority wrote that conflicting evidence in the criminal case must be interpreted as the advantage of the defendant.
That is why the daughter’s report must be interpreted so that, despite the contradictions in the report, it had been observed by the outside author to leave the fireplace.
The two oldest children of Auer have been called to be heard by court.
The daughter was first personally heard last year in the Court of First Instance.
When he was heard in court, he couldn't remember what happened the night of the murder.
Auer's second oldest child named her mother as a killer in a video interview in 2011.
The boy told me he heard the events of the night of the murder behind the closed door.
He also told me that Auer was planning to kill for six months.
As a lawyer, the boy has no obligation to say anything in court.
The court proceedings will continue today with the consultation of Anneli Auer.
The hearing of Auer will, if necessary, continue tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently sitting for more than seven years in prison for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to attend the G20 meeting?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him a lot of first hostiles.
Putin is supposed to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia is keenly discussing whether or not his entry should be allowed.
The Punkrock Activist Group, Pussy Riot, asked Australia this weekend to ban Putin's participation in the Summit with over 4,000 representatives from the most powerful countries in the world.
"This person, in our view, has nothing to do with the G20", said Maria Alyokhina to the public in Sydney's enclosed opera house in the context of the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned us to be on the edge of the "full war", and Putin calls parts of Ukraine "Novorossia" or "new Russia", so do we need to welcome him?
Tony Abbott has said, "respecting the decision."
According to Mike Callaghan, Head of the G20 Research Centre, the Australians cannot decide who will take part in the meeting, even if the meeting is held in the country.
"Australia can decide who it lets land, but it's an international meeting," she says.
Just like in New York's hosting UN meetings or in Washington's hosting meetings of the International Monetary Fund, it's not the responsibility of the empire to deny someone invited to come," Callaghan says.
In the previous week, Tony Abbott said "to weigh up the decision" after the aggravating actions of Russia in Ukraine.
This is a very important issue.
Since Putin is coming to a very important international meeting, Australia has no right to decide on this alone.
"There is, however, an important thing that I will consider a lot, and I believe that this is what other countries will do in the next few weeks," he says.
People will attend an anti-war meeting in Maripoli, Eastern Ukraine.
The event lasts two days, with a wide range of representatives from the world's largest and fastest emerging economies, with a total of about two-thirds of the world's population, representing 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union as well as a few separately invited non-G20 countries such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia was given the questionable task of balancing the various interests under high public pressure.
He believes that the Prime Minister's best way to deal with this is to take advantage of the opportunity to press Russia to speak publicly about his recent actions.
"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to use this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will call on President Putin to make an account of what he did."
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to report his actions," Callaghan says.
There is clearly an increase in geopolitical pressures.
I think the world expects them to take these things up.
Russian rebellists are preparing weapons for an attack on the Ukrainian military bases at the Donetsk airport in Eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether to attend Puti’s meeting, and according to Callaghan, this may not be known until a few days in advance.
I'm sure this is the last thing in Putin's mind.
He hardly notes that "I have to change my attitude toward Ukraine, because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November".
The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, has a view on the arrival of Putin in Australia "with special reservations", but he understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers to discuss with other countries and the G20s whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
This is an international, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
After the tragic events followed by the Malaysian Airlines storm, and in the absence of a sense of compassion, responsibility and proper cooperation in the field of air traffic, and now that thousands of Russian soldiers are fleeing at the border of Ukraine, I think that most Australians are very careful to welcome Putin to Australia.
The German business world criticizes "eighth" Berlin
Some of the German top corporate leaders warn that Germany has become "sufficient" and "sustainable" because government policy threatens the competitiveness of the country.
The criticism against the Government of Federal Secretary Angela Merkel occurs at the same time as the largest economy in Europe shows signs of slowing down, causing concern about whether it is able to run economic growth in the euro area that is steadily displaced.
The criticism of business managers is the result of the strong opposition of the German business sector to political decisions, including the introduction of minimum wage and the reduction of the retirement age of certain long-term workers to 63 years.
"I think the biggest threat is now an excessive confidence in Germany, which is inevitably a sense of self-discrimination," according to sales figures, the world's largest chemical manufacturer, Kurt Bock, says.
EU economy
He believes: "In general, we have the feeling that we are doing well, we have money for use and unemployment at a relatively low level, so what is the problem?"
I think there's a great danger.
The German Government's policy shows that we are not focusing on growth and not a favourable environment for businesses, but we are focusing on much more sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain entities.
According to Markus Kerber, the Managing Director of BDI, Germany, "The German situation is now good.
In the next ten years, however, each developed economy must change. ...[in Germany], the reform programme does not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce DIHK has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, and even the slowed consumption is growing again.
However, the second quarter of GDP declined has highlighted the vulnerability of the export-winning Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP decreased by 0.2 per cent over the three months before June compared with the previous year.
Germany’s weakened performance threatens to make the ECB’s fight against low inflation more difficult and could make it more likely to recover quantitatively.
Mr Kerber would like the government to "transfer from public consumption back to public investment", for example by focusing on the increases in future consumption on infrastructure rather than on pensions.
Kerber believes that the government of Merkel will destroy the fruits of his social democratic predecessor Gerhard Schröder at the beginning of the 21st century through strict policy.
According to Stefan Heidbreeder, the CEO of the Stiftung Familyenternemen Foundation for Family Enterprises, "The situation in Germany is still good compared to other countries.
It is thanks to businesses and not so much government policy. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The example of the neighbouring country, France, has shown that the use of money to social support and the restriction of the freedom to manage the company is the wrong way of action.
A leading German investment banking banking described the situation more explicitly, saying that recent government decisions are a "katastrophe".
Germany is threatening to lose everything that it has done so much work to please the voters.
This is my main issue right now," says the banker.
According to Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition have failed to solve the fundamental weaknesses of policy, which have caused the industry's competitive costs.
Ashton Kutcher's handcuff music festivals prevented security guards from entering the fan
The actor Ashton Kutcher participated in the Stagecoach national music festivals in India, California, where he is reported to have had a fight with a tough security officer.
Ashton Kutcher is reported to be in a fight with a security officer at a country music festival.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him at the backstage Stagecoach national music festivals in California, and then the situation got robbed, the TMZ website says.
Kutcher was in the VIPs when a young woman approached him to say hello and hand in hand.
When the star of the Men's Party series went to say hello to the fan, the super-intelligent security guard went in and caused the snack.
The actor and the security officer had to go in the middle of a handcuff, and Kutcher's friends had to go in the middle to hold Kutcher, TMZ tells us.
After separated from her ex-wife Demi Moore, Kutcher is dating Mila Kunis, who, like Kutcher, is the stars of the former '70s show.
The squirrel occurred shortly after Angus T. Jones was practically removed from the hit series's standard actor card after he published a video where he calls the series "rossy" and urges fans not to look at it.
The actor Ashton Kutcher participates in Stagecoach Music Festivals in California.
Angus T. Jones, "Jake," calls a series "asshole" and urges people not to look.
The Baltic Sea Bacterium killed a vacationer.
A bacteria from the Caribbean, which is placed on a popular German tourist destination, has caused six people to suffer from disease.
One of the sick people is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is encountered in parts of the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world, but it is mostly found in the Gulf of Mexico.
Bacteria spreads more effectively in breakwater over 20 degrees.
"Bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are right," Dr. Heiko Will, head of the Health and Security Office (LAGUS) of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, told The Local.
Bacteria is found in the same way in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to LAGUS, the sick had been on a holiday on Usedom Island at the end of July.
He died at the beginning of August.
Another pensioner has been in the coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his leg must be amputated.
He went swimming near Ahrenshop with a little wound on his leg.
The sick person went to the hospital after he noticed on his way home that his leg has become blue.
Doctors reported blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus.
"My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea region if he had known the danger," Sonja Bruehl, the sick wife, told the Osssee Zeitung.
Severe disease and damage caused by blood poisoning to the patient and his family could have been avoided if information had been better provided.
LAGUS told the Dpa News Office that the doctors had been advised to take the next infection at the beginning of the summer, but no official notice was given.
Cool temperatures have led to a lower risk of bacterial disease.
"[Maanday] test results showed a significant reduction in the V. vulnificus strain," says Dr. Will.
The cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of cholera-induced bacteria, is particularly dangerous if a person has a history of chronic liver disease and has impaired immune responses such as HIV or diabetes patients and elderly people.
The risk of male disease is higher than that of women because estrogen has been observed against a protective pathogen.
If the bacteria are infected, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
When Bacteria is wounded, the likelihood of death is approximately 25%.
V. vulnificus may also be infected by eating marine pollutants that it is contaminated, although, according to Dr. Will, in these cases, it is not this contagious.
Food contamination from the sea is more common in the southern half of the world.
In Germany, V. vulnificus bacteria caused poisoning the last time in 2010, when two people died.
Viino Kekkonen: Breast removed due to cancer suspects
The 80 - year - old singer Vieno Kekkonen plays and exercises hard, but he has also had to fear for his health.
I can't believe that the radiant Vieno Kekkonen is already 80 years old.
He himself is also surprised how many of those ages can suddenly be.
I haven't really realized that I'm so old.
For 80 years, it sounds like a lot, Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
Her birthday is Vieno Kekkonen's celebrating with his family.
At the end of August, a birthday party was held for him by the folk music and pensioner association in Karttu, where he lived his childhood.
We were on the stage of Kekkola, the place where my grandfather was born.
I was so cheerful about the party, the birthday hero tells me about the occasion where the stage for three hundred was full of congratulations.
A couple of days later, in Muhosa, was gathered to greet Armi Kussala, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers that he followed when he was young.
And now we're both ages!
Viino Kekkonen laughs.
During his long career, only a few aspects of Vieno Kekkose have not been seen in public.
One thing he has never said before in public: 2006 he was removed from another breast.
There was an unclear discovery in my chest in such a point that it was decided to remove it completely.
Then, in the end, it was not cancer, of course, which I was happy about.
The same surgery carried out a new breast, so it was a rather large measure.
Viino Kekkonen has not thought that she had lost her own breast in a way of negligence, because the knowledge of the unclear finding would have been a heavy position and cannot be ignored.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vieno Kekkonen tells and notes that the loss of my own breast for younger people is certainly more difficult.
Read Vieno Kekkosen's comprehensive personal interview in full on the afternoon-Sanom.
I want you to meet the digelice here!
The farmer is made guilty in the state of the sea
The debate on the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its link with the Finnish agriculture is depressing.
The voice of experts has been drowned to politically targeted opinions.
In particular, during the summer, Sanomat and Yle in Helsinki have been holding the responsibility of agriculture for nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea.
The same breathing has been called for rapid action to control emissions.
The average farmer is affected by a few environmental researchers and the suppliers who have been involved in the matter as compared to a highly comparable dietary expert.
The farmer knows that a nutrient rinse can not come from cultivation if the same amount of nutrients has been sown in the field as it is harvested with the harvest.
In Finland, almost all farms are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilisers and requires close monitoring and reporting of the nutrient balance.
The authorities will monitor compliance with the conditions.
Nutrients stored in the field have also been evaporated in water after damaging restrictions, but there has been a clear reduction in emissions for years too.
Farmers are willing and ready to continue to work to reduce nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that access to zero levels is impossible.
"If we want to have an approximate amount of agricultural production, we must accept that this is the case," says Jyrki Akkula, director of the MTT's environmental research (MT 29.8).
The past summer brought the Gulf of Finland a large number of blue-eyed inhesives.
Scientists were quite unanimous about the fact that the league gained its growth power from its own phosphorus stores in the sea.
The phosphorus stored on the bottom of the sea is, in part, an eraser of the past decades of farming in the coastal states, but it alone does not explain stocks.
The cleaning of waste water from the growing cities of the Baltic Sea was rising until the end of the 19th century.
The problem also concerned large-scale waste water, and they were not seen as a problem as to the contamination of their own beaches.
Parent pollution was prevented by building a waste water pipe on the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, the quality of water managed there has improved over the years.
The nutrients that once landed in the sea will not leave there, even if agriculture would be completely stopped from Finland.
However, each blue debate and the alleged accusations are always subject to the agriculture of today.
The public debate marks the farmer responsible for the Baltic Sea state.
The accusation is disproportionate, but it becomes increasingly difficult when it is used to implement political passions.
Under the leadership of their President, Minister for the Environment, Ville Ninisto, the Greens are leading to major changes in agricultural environmental standards.
Niinisto has used the summer's rest discussion as a campaign board.
In many words, the Niolismus has accused the producer's representative organisation of the old-fashioned nature and considered it the most difficult obstacle to the protection of water.
There should be some limit on political rhetoric.
Most specific projects in the field of water protection are specifically based on cooperation between the MTK, farmers and environmental management.
The sophisticated style serves more to fish the green sounds of the city than to protect the water.
I think that's the point.
With hard speeches, the Greens are preparing to leave the government.
In the context of policy changes, the MTK shall be responsible for the living of its members.
It is difficult to trade expensive changes for farmers unless there is a replacement for their costs.
The only money that Ville Ninisto has presented is the cuts on other agricultural funds.
The cancellation of mine tax doesn't go through: Palmer
The last attempt of Abbott's government to throw the mine tax on the fountain seems to be devastated, because Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will reject it without any changes.
The Australian Labour Party also fears that the government has included a new initiative rule to limit employers' increases to compulsory pension payments up to 2034.
The government took advantage of a qualified majority in Parliament's sub-committee on Monday to rush through the repeal process in the power of general confusion and in the face of a clear agitation of the Labour Party.
The original repeal initiative, which the Senate had previously made significant changes, was overlooked and replaced by a new legislative proposal, which it described above all in relation to taxes, pension contributions, social security and family social support.
Initially, it was an initiative which attempted to repeal the "favoured" mining tax and other decisions such as a pension fee for low-income (3.6 billion dollars), a bonus for earnings (1.3 billion dollars) and a bonus for children of school age (4.7 billion dollars).
Clive Palmer, Head of the United Party (PUP) did not accept the transfer of the government.
"The planned mining tax renouncer will not be accepted in the Senate without a pension fee for low-income persons, a payroll for earnings and a bonus for children of school age," he twitted.
The government needs the support of independent parties such as the PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
Minister of Finance of the Shadow State, Chris Bowen, accused the government of trying to remove Parliament's power to decide on the compulsory amount of pension contributions, giving the Minister of Finance all the power to decide.
"This is unprecedented," he said to journalists in Canberra.
In this way, the government could delay other increases, which would allow the 12% guarantee target of the Labour Party to reach 2034.
"It is not acceptable in any way, and the Labour Party will, of course, be able to resist in every way," Bowen says.
The guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide whether to stop future increases.
The man's body was found at Brighton's swimming pool.
The Sussex cops picked up the body of an unidentified man before two o'clock in the afternoon, and the police closed the area close to the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway sight.
The police and the Death Investigator are working to find out the conditions under which the body fell on the beach.
The man hasn't been identified yet.
Researchers will review the list of missing persons to determine whether missing persons are connected to the body.
The police were not yet able to confirm whether death was under suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, by an accidental explosion at the border, one death victim.
According to Piedras Negras police, the accidental explosion in the customs building at the border of Mexico and the United States caused the death of one woman and the injury of five other persons.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas is the operational leader of the local police in the city border of Texas.
He told the Associated Press News Office that a woman who died at a Sunday explosion had skull damage and five others had burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion occurred this morning at the customs offices' nights.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but the authorities believe that the explosion has been caused by gas accumulation.
The explosion didn't affect border guards.
Three Atlantic City casinos close in September
Three Atlantic City casinos close their doors this month.
A male customer plays in the Showboat casino, which is supposed to close its door, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
It's going to be a difficult month for Atlantic City when three casinos share their last cards on the table.
Three casinos close their doors this month in Atlantic City in the state of New Jersey, which means that this neon light, known as the wall of money machines, can no longer count on the income of the game.
More than 5 000 employees will be unemployed while closing the Showboat and Revel casinos this weekend, the Associated Press News Office reported.
There will be more unemployed people when Trump Plaza turns out their lights.
Three casinos, one of which had only been able to operate for two years, expected closure is the city’s latest disaster after the end of the Atlantic Club story only eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25% of the city’s casino workers, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, the New York Times writes.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice for Atlantic City, the AP news agency.
However, the local gambling industry has received a lot more competitors when the casinos in New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania read a large part of Atlantic City once so huge casinos.
Even a former opponent of gambling, Massachusetts, is looking at his own share of the money by greeting the state with three casinos.
TVO: The new schedule of Areva is difficult to accept
According to the Industrial Power (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new assessment by the supplier of the plant, Areva, that Olkiluodo’s third-party reactor will only be made commercially available until 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoise, the head of the power plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that construction works are already largely ready and the number of works that are underway is known.
TVO will continue to assess the information received from Areva.
In the note, Silveninen states that the TVO welcomes all initiatives to speed up the project.
Today, Areva submitted an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3 to TVO, according to which the construction work of the third reactor will be completed in the middle of 2016 and commercial activity could begin in 2018.
According to the Areva Bulletin, the recent delays in the project were mainly due to the approval of the reactor's automation systems that were received in April.
This was preceded by the four-year negotiations with the TVO.
Olkiluto 3 had to be completed initially in 2009, but the schedule has been postponed over and over.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about which is responsible for delays.
It is disputed in the arbitration court where Areva has called for compensation of EUR 2.7 billion from TVO.
In turn, TVO considers Areva's requirements unfounded and demands about EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water players is needed in the face of global challenges
Today, international leaders gathered in Stockholm within the 24th International Water Week, calling on energy and water players to cooperate to meet the greatest challenges of our time, to ensure sufficient water and energy production for the growing population.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed for pumping, storing, transporting and cleaning of water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will affect the other immediately.
These two reserves are also an integral part of sustainable development and must always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, CEO of the Stockholm International Water Institute organized by the Water Week, said in the opening of the Water Week that "the challenges are huge".
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore more closely cooperation between energy and water players is needed in order to find solutions that enable all nations of the world to flourish.
Professor John Briscoe, who has received the Water Week of this year, described the water as a basis for growth that is needed in society as a whole and in other sectors. Briscoe said that "development countries are facing major challenges.
They have to mobilise these funds.
Briscoe added: "There is no permanent solution to the [water crisis].
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form the ring.
Within a week, representatives will discuss the work and future work and cooperation of energy and water operators during more than a hundred seminars, workshops and events.

Flighting dead foreign bodies home in Miami: cost of body flight
In October 2012, 23 Cuban refugees to Miami fell, and 14 people were reported to die.
The same has happened to hundreds earlier, and this was certainly not the last of its quality.
Every year more than 1 000 Mediterranean immigrants die trying to cross the US border illegally.
For the first town, they're ready to die.
It is ironic, however, that when they arrive in the first city in the country, few are planning to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either asylum, an effort board upwards or a place of entertainment waiting for a better opportunity.
Few people think they will die there, and when death is approaching, many are planning to return to their homeland.
In the favoured cities of migrants, a disproportionately large number of immigrants living abroad and temporarily residents in the country, in which death and return to their homeland continue to work.
It is estimated that 20 per cent of the bodies that died in South Florida are flying elsewhere, more than anywhere in the United States.
The majority of human remains (HR, short form of professional slang, human remains) will be flown to their home country from the international airport in Miami.
Since 1964, approximately 80% of this transport will be flown abroad, according to Pierson, the largest company in the industry, and the company will fly bodies to several locations in Central and South America and several European countries.

The more migrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, returning home has a cost.
Miami is the main airport of American Airlines for Latin American flights, and the figures in the table describe the human remains that the airline has returned to its homeland in 2013.
The return of bodies to homeland is not cheap: prices can vary from five to 100 thousand dollars.
The religious, cultural and general health requirements related to the flight and delivery of human remains vary.
Emigration communities of the favoured cities of migrants sometimes organise funeral communities to help costs because the return of bodies is expensive, the government does not help in the process and the deaths are often young people who do not have insurance.
Some credit institutions and non-formal health insurance schemes have been created from such communities as those founded by Italian, Jewish and Greek, the first migrant groups in the United States, which lived in New York.
The new generations of Mexicans, Chinese, Philippines and Bangladesh immigrants are now working in several of their favoured cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties, as few people who move abroad are planning to become their last rester of the city of migrants.
For example, in Dubai, without a will, the Sharia Act applies to the dead foreigners, even if the laws on the recovery of the dead's home country were different.
The entire property of the dead shall be frozen and then distributed in accordance with the ruling of the Sharia Court.
The network of Aer Lingus, which is considered central to Dublin, transporting human residues (
2013) reflects the multicultural structure of the city and the Irish.
The airline interrupted the service, but reopened it in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from migrants.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person travels through a popular city of immigrants or when he lives there.
On the contrary, a temporary or permanent move to the city of migrants is an open declaration of the way the migrant looks at life, not death.
However, death in a migrant city abroad means taking the most powerful and irrevocable decisions of the migrant – decisions on whether or not they want to be part of the local or global community, the universe or the country, the short-term or the eternal.
The Centre and the Left Union make a matter of inequalification
The opposition parties and the Left Union are going to make a matter for the government about the income of low incomes and the increase in in inequalities.
The parties want to raise debates on the problems of living people's lives, which are raised by poor economic development and aggravating unemployment.
The growing inequalification is also seen between the different parts of the country and within the large cities, and the parties point out in their communications.
The government's next year's budget has cuts and tax increases, according to the parties, to low incomes, such as students, unemployed and pensioners, family and ordinary work, while food, medicines and housing continues to increase.
In fact, almost half a million people are already unemployed, the parties say in their communications.
The livelihood problems of working people have also worsened.
The parliamentary groups of the Central and Left Union will discuss this matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party's fundamental Finns have already announced that they have left an interim question about the resources of the police and internal security.
The Parliament's symposium begins tomorrow Tuesday.
The New York City West Indian Day Parade will begin soon.
The Caribbean culture is again in New York City, where the West Indian Day Parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and politicians also see and see each other.
The annual parade will be held on Monday in Brooklyn.
It pours out the traditional celebrations of pre - fasting carnavals, and some of them are dancers who carry complex, often from the sleeves.
The President of the Brooklyn region, Eric Adams, is the festival champion of this year, but there are also many other faces that are known for politics.
The parade is a great opportunity for today's and candidate politicians to greet the public a week before the elections.
Despite the celebrations, the parade tree has also been a part of violence in previous years.
The police have said that they are trying to keep the event safe by means of additional measures, including by monitoring the activities of gangs operating nearby.
Is it worth asking rhetoric questions at least?
Everyone knows the rhetoric questions, doesn't everyone?
That question shouldn't be answered.
This linguistic image, which is a question that is not expected to be answered, but which suggests a certain answer, tastes both high-speed speeches and more daily expressions.
The initials of the accusation of Ciceron's famous Catilina are a chain of rhetoric questions, the first of which is "How long, o Catilina, are you going to make use of our patience?"
The same applies to my wife's questions: "Why shouldn't I warm up five days old chicken?"
Why are you so tense?
The difference is a finer word for a rhetorical question.
The power of the rhetoric question lies in the fact that it is open, and the public is persuaded to accept the question.
The subtle rhetoric question suggests that no one who makes sense could agree on it.
The author David Williams of the 19th century booklet in Manuscript described the rhetoric question as "some words that are admirably designed to produce a strong feeling of the truth on a subject, and at the same time the challenge they put forward is impossible to disagree."
The skill of diligence
Retortical questions can be left behind if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
A number of rhetoric questions that have been raised after a follow-up, designed to express grief or agitation, are called epiplex.
For example, Job uses them when he appeals to the Almighty, "What are you doing to oppress me --?
Do you have eyes like ours?
Do you see the same way a person sees?
There are also chains of rhetoric questions in my wife's comments: "Why did you cause food poisoning for children?
Are you crazy?
Can't you do anything right?
In addition, there is a so - called hypophorus, what is it about when you ask the question and answer it immediately.
Isaac Hayes provides an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg that is a sex fear for all women?
Bart!
That's right!
Who would sacrifice their lives for his brother?
More examples from my wife: "What is the only food that the children have eaten, and where have they come from?"
This chicken.
Who's the idiot feeding it to them?
You.
Strangely, the rhetoric question is usually not trying to bend, although rhetoric means the skill of bending.
If you are trying to talk about someone around instead of trying to preach to those who have already been turned or wrathing about someone’s self - despair, you should use rhetoric questions with a suffice.
They are more useful in trying to coordinate opinions than trying to get one to accept his own opinion.
If the public agrees with the argument "And it is not nice when it is so sunny out?", the rhetorical question says that the speaker is sure of what he said, which is more binding between the speaker and the public.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is sure that there are no different opinions.
Assuming that consensus has been reached instead of seeking consensus, the speaker may seem, well, self-concerned.
In other situations, the rhetoric question refers to the weakness of the argument.
In the titles of the papers, the rhetorical question is too often the strongest possible argument in a very weak case: "Did aliens build pyramids?"
In both cases, the risk is that the question may lead to an answer that differs from the suggested answer.
"Do you think the same as us?" belonged to the British Conservative Campagne Resolution at the general elections in 2005.
The party's gone.
Some of these cases have become a hobby, and the so-called QTWAIN issues (the concept of Questions To Wich Answer Is No, made by the British supplier John Rentoull, are popular).
A few years ago, a friend of mine arranged a competition to look for the best examples.
The contest was clearly won by the song "Do You Wanda Be In My Gang", which was sang by Pop Star Gary Glitter before he revealed children's sexual abuse.
The author has also written the book You Talkin' to Me?
Researcher: The time of the Federal Commissioner may be over
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries were still thinking that the federal state could be some kind of compromise to the conflict, says Saari.
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, said earlier in an interview with the Russian channel, that peace in Eastern Ukraine requires discussions about the state station in the region.
In practice, this would mean some kind of autonomy in eastern Ukraine.
According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of people living in the East.
The transformation of Ukraine into a federal state is, according to Saare, a priority in a certain way to the objectives pursued by Russia.
Ukraine must have reason to suspect that Russia would thus try to influence Ukraine's internal policy, he says.
If it is not possible to reach a federal settlement, the second option could be some kind of frozen conflict from the Russian point of view, where Russia would in practice control Luhanski and Donetsk, Saari.
West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending both weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has contested the allegations, although, for example, Russian-minded rebels themselves have said that their troops have fought "flight Russian soldiers on holiday".
Chairman of the Up: An influential task planned for the Chase
The silicon reminds us that the action is new and is still drawing.
He believes that the idea is that Kataine would coordinate or even lead to the Commission's work on issues of competitiveness and employment.
Of course, one of the priorities of the Commission's new season's programme is the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That is how we are at the heart of the Commission's power, says the Tilikian.
The Tilikian believes that the background, economic knowledge and role of Katais during the economic crisis will give him opportunities for a good position within the Commission.
According to the plans, the task should be tangible, i.e. Katais would not be under its own DG.
Instead, Katais would become a team leader in the EU's competitiveness and employment sector, which would allow him to have other portfolios related to the economic Commissioner, not only the portfolio, but also to coordinate.
In practice, management of the team could mean planning and guidance, for example.
Military mothers: Up to 15 000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Military Mothers Organization, up to 15 000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine in the past two months, and there are currently more than 7 000 Russian soldiers in the country.
According to human rights organisations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organization, the hospital in the city of Rostov near the border of Ukraine is filled in the Ukraine’s war wounded.
Military mothers collect their data from soldiers' relatives.
The NATO has estimated that there are more than a thousand Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte's alcohol abuse, "A little drink comes a case"
Big Brother Jussi and Andte were on Monday night to think about the life of the BB House.
On Monday night, Jussi, on the basement side, pawned a fitness bike with the Andte of Kartano's residents.
The twin wondered what they were doing to the viewers of the program.
Not until he's seen it, Andte said.
In Jussi's view, the majority of the time in the BB House is waiting and spending time.
Possible parties or missions form only a break-in part of the life of the BB House.
It's more like waiting and wondering and talking and living.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
On Wednesday, the people of Kartano spent the evening in moist signs, and the alcohol especially got Andte on the phone.
Jussi asked Andel whether the party had made a man’s life in the house more meaningful now that he had come to speak with other residents in a little hippo.
A little drink, and then there'll be a case, Andte's admitting.
Look at Andte's interview on the ISTV video!
Anna Abreu will reveal her body handwriting at Me Women
Anna Abreu tells me in Me Women's magazine that she decided to die two years ago when she was on a show break.
At that time, the tired Anna thought she was getting more energy by diluting.
Fred Montana / Splash News
Anna dreamed a couple of years ago of the Victoria's Secret model.
My body owner was a Victoria's Secret model.
I wanted to look good, and I thought I wanted to lose weight, and Anna told the papers.
After training his body with works and music videos, Anna says that he is not a lustress, even though he has been named.
Viena Rivieri
Ann, who's okay with Timm, trains at the gym and carries boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I can raise a certain amount of weight in the gym, Anna points out.
Sometimes a pop star gives itself permission to decorate.
If I'm delicious, I'm really delicious.
Sometimes I pull unhealthy nightmares, and I don't think about any more pounds.
Instead, I wonder what my body thinks.
I'm disgusting if I do something bad to my body.

Anna says she's enjoying her body.
Profit sharing companies please shareholders but does not increase growth
Do the directors of Australia’s stock exchange companies today only try to please a large crowd by approving the demands of shareholders for a greater distribution of profits and buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power shifting from corporate governments to shareholders that the government serves?
The distribution of profits is most important; last week it was revealed at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of the shares of the companies that have awarded investors in the form of redemption programmes and by sharing more profits have risen clearly.
And there's nothing bad about it.
However, the reverse side of the coin is that capital consumption is going to fall faster than the analysts have predicted, which makes many wonders whether the popularity for a short time will be overreacted and whether the focus will be sufficient on the growth of the near future and long-term.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
More funding is obtained, for example, from a cheap stock market.
From the point of view of the company, this is reasonable because the loan is currently cheap, while capital is not.
However, even if funds acquired on the loan market are not taken into account, it is clear that openness to shareholders is funded primarily by the fact that the company uses less money to invest.
The net result of this wave of purchase programmes (and the cancellation of profit investment plans) is the decrease in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period for the "capitalisation period" during which companies have tried to keep the shareholding at all levels low.
As part of the same plan, companies have increasingly less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the repurchase programmes was EUR 3.7 billion and the value of the expected unrealised capital procurement programmes was 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far that it considers spending capital to be a curse in the title of its report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, informal evidence has been present for months.
The President of the Australian Central Bank, Glenn Stevens, considered it sufficient to point out a few weeks ago that companies needed a little more "fighting spirit" to increase investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the future prospects of individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, as slow capital consumption usually leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says that "the own estimates of their capital consumption by reporting companies have decreased by an average of 4% over the last two years.
The estimates of free cash flow have risen by an average of two per cent.
Improvement of cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This rapid look will have a good effect from the perspective of current shareholders and stock markets, but it is also some kind of evidence of corporate obedience.
If I could get a coin every time the CEO says that the short-term price of the share is not important, I'd be... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
This claim is, of course, not true.
Managing Directors are very closely monitoring the stock prices and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short and long-term bonus packages of managing directors are defined according to the value of the shares, and the position of the managers depends on it.
Managing Directors want to say that some decisions (whether they were business, increased investment in an organisation or profit sharing) are not always directly popular, but are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, business managers often complain about the fact that there is a very short-looking approach in the investment market.
Therefore, the current lack of conservativeity seems to be a alignment with short-term objectives.
However, it was too clear for those who assess the low-cost stock market and support the saving of capital that this concern does not exist; however, in the short-term reporting period, it was too clear that the weight was in the reduction of future capital consumption, and the most prosperous companies were encouraged.
Large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, considered the first factor in reducing capital consumption, but also many other companies do the same – part of the compulsion and some because they were afraid of the reaction of the shareholders.
Why, then, do investors pressure companies to share profits?
According to the credit Suisse Strategist Hasan Tevfik, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as the profits of other traditional fixed-winning investment products have been reduced, as the central banks have surprisingly calculated global interest rates to bring more money on the market.
Thus, investors have been forced to seek profits for the capital market and, in turn, pressure companies to share more profits.
The shareholders have also made it quite clear for companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profits are uncertain.
Investors would prefer money as more and more investors approach the retirement age.
The statistics in the previous reporting period clearly show that the distribution of profits had a significant impact on companies' cost cuts and not on the increase in turnover.
Cases of bleeding of public naked images appear to be a data urchin or an e-mail account break-in
According to Jennifer Lawrence's photos and some sources, an unknown hacker who leaked videos on the Internet wonders about data security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published lists of female publicity persons in a chatroom and said that he has more pictures of women, some of the photographers have reported that their images are fake, while others have said that they were taken long ago.
There are a lot of films and it has been said to include Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Uppto and American actor Mary E Winstead.
After hacking, the biggest question is how the attack was carried out.
What about the pictures and videos that were real and where they were downloaded?
The main source of the news is pictures – an insecure and thorough attack on Apple's iCloud service – is the most likely option.
Large companies such as Apple have invested in inside-house security teams with the task of attempting to infiltrate the company’s own systems regularly.
"A large amount of hacking into Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
Furthermore, the original publisher does not claim that the claim should be correct," points out Rik Ferguson, Vice-President of the Trend Micro Research Unit.
A simpler and more likely explanation for these hackers (and for hackers with less famous people every day) is e-mail address and password leaking, either by guessing or by scaming, i.e. by swindling a person to log in with his information on a genuinely-looking website, after which these information is used against them.
Apple is still investigating the alleged attack on the iCloud service used on iPhone phones to record settings and, above all, to the backup of images when they are transferred to the Cloud server.
The user's account can be logged in by providing this email address and password in the iCloud service, after which their image and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has introduced a two-step identification ("two factor autonomy", 2FA), i.e. an extra protection against the entry into the account, when sending a code to the owner's mobile phone before the account can be logged in.
However, comparatively few use 2FA property, either because it is unknown or because it is considered to be troubled.
Apple is still examining whether all the information comes from its iCloud service and, if so, how widely the user's accounts were infiltrated.
The company has not delivered an opinion on this at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the "Are you missing your password" link to Apple's iCloud service by first collecting the e-mail addresses of the public persons, for example, from the address book of the other hacked device.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password in several services, when passwords were abducted through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's photos says the pictures are real, but don't tell me when they're taken.
Winstead said in his Tweet that this could be a long-term hacker.
These pictures were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took a gruesome effort.
I feel sympathy for everyone else who has been targeted by hacking," he wrote in his Tweet.
However, Self-Safety Expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought that he removed the images from his mobile phone, but the removal of the image from the modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the image.
Modern smartphones regularly record pictures of the cloud service because they often do not have room for a large number of pictures taken by the user.
Apple's iPhone standard setting is to record images in iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft Windows phones recording images for OneDrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, provide automatic images and data recording service.
"Mens take and remove pictures, but they don't understand that they're downloaded from the account," says Cluley to The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "Deported does not always mean abolished," he states.
Photos and videos can be stored for years.
If someone gets access to the user's e-mail address and password, he can reload all the images and videos sent by email.
From Apple's service, images can be downloaded to a Mac machine, Windows PC or any Apple device.
The hacker published a screenshot that was alleged to present videos and images currently unpublished from Windows PC.
A two-step identification will protect against such hacking because it requires all those who are trying to copy an existing account to another device to give a code sent to the original user device, usually to a mobile phone.
Without the code, access to the account is prevented.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offer a two-step identification to the account, but it is not yet known whether and how many of them used it.
Some have said that the pictures in which they are alleged are not real.
Ariana Grande's representative has said that the pictures in which Grande is alleged are "real-time counterfeits".
Victoria Justice wrote in Tweet: "The naked naked pictures of you are false, don't you understand?
Let me cut off the rumor roots immediately.
Cluley's bringing up a second option.
As the target of hacking was publicity, they may have had to break into their accounts by someone who handled their social media accounts or regularly e-mailed them.
"I'd like to know if the actors' agencies or any representative are involved," he asks.
However, those public authorities do not use one of the publishers or agencies.
The second option is that someone who installed or helped to configure one or more systems of the victim's security attack, changed the system secretly so that all information can be returned.
This is what happened in the case of Christopher Chaney, a floridan, where the hacker disseminated images from Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis' e-mail accounts in 2011, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison in December 2012.
Chaney was accused of entering the e-mail accounts of over 50 people in the entertainment industry secretly between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera to take pictures of the star as a low costume and then published the photos online.
Chaney later apologized, saying, "I'm sure his actions were one of the worst insults of privacy that he could imagine."
Chaney was also claimed to be blinded by two people online for over ten years.
According to Cluey, "in the case of Chaney, they were hacked into the e-mail accounts of the stars, and they were modified so that someone forwarded their information even after the change of the password".
Cluley says that the obsessive action of hackers that break into these accounts "remembers the collection of butterflies".
They just want to collect this kind of information.
It is possible that in this case someone had encountered a list of services such as Dropbox containing the information and logging information on these accounts.
Hackers have also been able to try to penetrate for a long time.
or they were able to access information from someone's email account, such as the address book, and then fished for other persons.
I don't think it's a simple iCloud security hole.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN to track down 44 peacekeepers who were kidnapped in Syria by terrorists involved in al-Qaeda.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusran believes that 44 Fiji Peacekeepers are imprisoned. This terrorist group conquered Golan's crossing position on the hills last week and forced UN troops to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday, and there is no information on where they are.
In Samoa, ministers participating in the UN Conference of Small Enhanced Islands, including the Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what has happened.
Mr Bishop discussed the situation with the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Mon at the Summit and has offered Australia's help to save the missing peacekeepers.
"I have assured you that Australia will help the UN in everything that it can, by providing, for example, intelligence assistance," he said to the AAP news service from Samoa on Monday.
We're very closely in contact with all the ways of cooperation and friends of the intelligence network -- to ensure that we can find them and that they're safe.
Bishop has already assured the Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia is using its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the Philippines Peacekeeper team held prisoners in their military cassettes was reported fleeing in different parts of the same controversial area.
The UN has been watching Golan’s hills since the ceasefire of Syria and Israel in 1974.
Cheaters are trying to steal your money by means of a coal tax cancellation initiative, warn Australian competition authority ACCC
The deceasers use the carbon tax renouncer to steal money, the ACCC warns.
The SCAMwatch Unit of the Competition Authority has warned consumers and businesses not to rely on excessively sound offers by government agencies offering thousands of dollars of credit.
You may use the figures you see in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save when buying goods after the cancellation of the coal tax and offer it up to $7,000, the warning says.
Cheaters may sound very convincing because they have discovered the personal data of the victim that they use in attempting to obtain banking information or trying to get the victim to pay the reward.
They're discussing topical topics to deceive the victim.
The frauders use more than just carbon tax evasion to get access to money, their stories are more evolving, and they take advantage of topical things to build a scam around them.
Also, the flight MH370 lost by Malaysia Airlines and the death of Robin Williams have enthusiastics.
The ACCC advises the company to contact the company instead of the contact information provided by the caller by means of the contact information itself, if there is no doubt about the identity of the player representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or e-mail from someone who claims to represent a government agency or company, such as the energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation for the non-coal tax, be careful.
If you believe that you have been cheated and given personal information or transferred money to a fraudulent account, please contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true — for example, free money distributed by the government — it is likely to be true.
Economic voices: Lipponen blames EU Russia sanctions
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticises the sanctions imposed by the EU for Russia in an interview with Economic Sanctions.
Russia's policy priorities are to promote its own interests.
This is not necessarily what the sanctions are for," says Lipponen in the interview.
Lipponen has started working as a evaluator for the business of the Arctic regions of the Central Association of Economics.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development EBRD and the European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended Russia's project funding as part of the EU's economic sanctions.
"It means, for example, that environmental projects of the northern dimension, which have clear visions, go to ice," says Lipponen in the interview.
The freezing of funding now hampers cooperation, which, according to Lippose, may be difficult if there is no confidence.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Ice Sea region will continue as much as before.
He is currently conducting an EK report on Finland's Arctic policy and business opportunities in the north.
It is not affected by the acute situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
The report looks forward, talks about decades," he says.
It is rare that the Norpe comes near a low water or a nearby facility, says the Nature Pedagogi Vesa Heinonen from the Centre of the Northern Museum.
In Vaasa Suvilahti, a Norpe was seen swimming near the beach on Sunday.
Heinosen says that the Norpe has probably come after food in the Summer Bay.
It's not messed up.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinone's tip.
He said, for example, that on the Sundom Bridge, in particular in the spring and autumn, an elbow will be seen, which will arrive precisely after fish.
Norppa is still not a common species in the Sea of Vaasa.
In the liverland, they see an elbow in the resorts, he goes on.
Norps live in the Pacific and the island Sea, among other things.
According to the South Australian court, Robert Vallelonga, a murdered pizzerian, acted aggressively and violently outside the nightclub.
Murdered South Australian pizzerian named Robert Vallelonga.
In the hearing of justice, it has been found that the pizzerian Robert Vallelonga was aggressively acting against both his partner and the security officer only minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
Attorneys charged for the murder of Vallelonga requested the release of their client against the guarantees at the lower court of Adelaide because it was "clearly" self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case is not serious enough to keep her client, whose identity has not been published, behind prisons until the trial.
"The evidence is that the dead behaved so aggressively that he had to be removed from the nightclub," he said.
After that, the squirrel started, which led to this 40-year-old drunk man-- torch the security man's shirt.
It is important to note that, according to the prosecution, death was caused by one strike, which clearly refers to self-defense or defence of the other.
A 25-year-old man is only charged with killing until now.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious at the crossing of Round St and Synagogue Place at about 2.25 a.m. on May 4, he had severe head injury.
He died in his injuries at the Adela's Royal Hospital early the next day. Friends and pizzeria clients were left to die of one Tree Hill's "local legend".
According to the prosecutors, there was no cause for the murder of the defendant, and after the case he had said to the cab driver, "that he had let someone sleep for a few days".
But the video of the security camera now proves something else, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the dead behaved aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and received his own share of hard and violent behaviour," he says.
On our client's side, the assumption of innocence and evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
The prosecutors opposed the release of the man because only one of the three guardians present at night had been involved in the behaviour of Vallelonga.
According to them, the other security officers did not consider him to be threatening because "it was short," and he used the word store of a big man because he wanted to avoid physical confrontation.
They said that the cab driver who clearly saw the case would also prove that Vallelonga was "powerfully beaten" and had no opportunity to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered a man to be arrested until the next week when he would declare his decision.
The contested dolphin hunt began in Japan, based on tradition - foreign news - Evening-Sanomas
Bad weather was expected to postpone the beginning of a widely spoiled hunting in the world.
In the Japanese city of Taiji, the annual hunting season of dolphins began again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
The British newspaper Guardia tells of the vast opposition that has become part of the world.
In hunting, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins into a remote bay pod where mammals are slaughtered after the most suitable individuals have been selected to be transported to dolphins and theme parks around the world.
Dolphin meat also ends in food.
However, according to the local authorities, the beginning of the hunting was expected to delay due to the bad weather.
Information on practice spread to the world in 2009 with the documentary picture The Cove.
During the previous periods of hunting, diplomatics have criticised the hunting not only for animal conservation.
According to the opponents, there is in any case a limited market for dolphin meat due to its high mercury content.
It is a tradition for those defending hunting, including the Japanese government.
The defendants have also reminded us that dolphins are not a threat.
During the weekend, Delphin hunt was resisted by demonstrations in several countries.
According to protesters in Tokyo, Japan’s reputation in the world was damaged.
A demonstration was also held in Helsinki on Monday in front of the Japanese embassy.
Part of the NATO Member States’ uncertainties about the investment of new troops in Eastern Europe
Within the NATO, the military union is divided into views on whether to set up NATO bases in Eastern Europe and Balticia as a response to the crisis in Ukraine, reports the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the Military Alliance to bring permanent troops to their countries, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
"Ukraina has given a new perspective on Russia's policy and threatens to destroy European security," said Michael Clarke Financial Times, head of the Royal United Services Institute in London.
The NATO Member States will be gathered in the beginning of the week, and the Military Union will have to publish its new preparedness plans.
The main issue of the plan is whether NATO can break the 1990 TEE convention on conventional weapons.
That is where the NATO and Warsaw Association agree to place armed forces in the Atlantic-Uralberg region.
In practice, according to the Financial Times, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltic.
Russia itself freezed its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not actually renounce the agreement.
In view of the exacerbated situation in Ukraine, NATO is wondering whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
"Nato's resources must be available in all the NATO countries that need resources," said Sir Malcolm Rifkind Financial Times, President of the British Parliament's Security Committee.
Matt Guthmiller, the youngest flying around the world
When other teenagers learned to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.
The 19 - year - old Guthmiller became the youngest flying around the world — and alone, the CBS News correspondent Carter Evans reported.
A young man in South Dakota flew 30 000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 different countries in five different continents.
On their trip, Guthmiller was treated like a rock star because of his recording flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
It's too risky and, uh, some spoiled, rich kid just wants to see a little world and have fun.
Mr Guthmiller had not much to say to the authors of such comments.
Of course, I enjoyed a lot of fun, but it also included a lot of work, and I hope that by my record I will also enthusiast other people to go to the world and do great things.
At the very young age, Guthmiler's flight initiation started, and first he asked his parents to get out of the airport to eat at the cafes.
Later, he demanded to get to the flight lessons.
My parents let me go for a short, $20, a 20-minute visit, but I think they thought at that time that my enthusiasm would stop.
He didn't stop.
Soon thereafter, Guthmiller made a contract with his parents to allow him to have more time in the cockpit.
I agreed to share a car with my father all the time in high school instead of getting my own car.
In the exchange shop, I could fly planes.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a license, and two years later he leaked a single-engine Beechcraft aircraft for its sole flight around the world.
A young man at MIT High School took care of aircraft maintenance and made fuel calculations.
Many hours in the upper world also meant that he himself needed additional tanks —
practically a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says he had eaten a few biscuits in a long flight.
Flying a cloud was both amazing and scary.
Air traffic controllers in other countries did not have a set of regulations to help them navigate around storms.
I had no idea which clouds were just a little above the plane and which of them were up to 45,000 feet and were torn the plane into pieces.
Guthmill's plane was not pressured and had no oxygen reserve, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
The fuel level of the machine would not have reached a higher level.
On the day following the interview, another young pilot, the 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died after his plane dropped on a flight between Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls the most difficult part of his journey.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he thought that the rise would be technically challenging due to the high amount of fuel needed for 16 hours of flight.
However, despite the risks and even the fear of a high place, Guthmiller managed to break the record and collect money for ATK training through the Code.org site.
He's a coder himself, and he set up his own company at 12 years of age.
Guthmilter's goals are in the sky.
It would be great to base the next Apple, but let's see how it goes.
In any case, Guthmiller is going to aim at a high level.
Target the sky, and you can achieve something great.
It's harder to find a real franchise entrepreneur than you think.
Lori Joyce was enthusiastic in the line of fans in her Cupcakes by Heather and Lori shops around Canada after the Canadian W TV channel started to show the Cupcake Girls online TV program in 2009.
The enthusiasm continued until it became clear that one of the franchise entrepreneurs was not suitable for the mission.
"My Frenchise businessman sat in his car and called me that a hundred potential customers are standing outside the store ready to buy a cupcake, and he can't stand the situation," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge lost opportunity for us.
After what happened, Joyce decided to change the franchise partners’ selection process, starting with emphasising the cultural leadership of the company instead of the baking skills.
"Everyone can glorify in the interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, adding that he's had about a hundred interviews for each 11 franchise store.
We will start with six weeks of training, but workers are working in a completely different way in their working environment, so the whole process is quite difficult, and therefore we will focus on the appropriateness of the business culture.
Finding the right franchise entrepreneur is vital for the development of any small enterprise.
A strong and honest manager is able to modify and increase the organisation, while a badly suitable manager can cause expensive damage to the company.
"Before I thought looking for a franchise entrepreneur would be like having a date, but it's not true at all. During dating, you can do a lot to get to know the other before getting married," Joyce says.
Instead, in the case of a franchise partner, a contract is signed, secured and a new store is built.
Partnership with someone before you see how a person works is a huge step and a significant test of trust.
The symbiotic relationship between the Franchise partners is similar to a strong marriage, because they have common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, Chairman and CFA of the Canadian Franchise Association.
That is why McLachlan believes that a franchise entrepreneur should also be careful when choosing a future franchise donor before taking such a long-term partnership.
"This is the same idea as in human relationships: if a date is rude already on a date, imagine what she is like in a marriage," she says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose with care and assess the future contracting partner and pay attention to the smallest alarm signals from either side.
McLachlan adds that franchise donors like Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time, those who are a franchise donor must be more careful when choosing the first, most important partners.
On the other hand, new franchise donors have to conclude on the basis of a successful parent company which they have had to face and what kind of skills a new franchise entrepreneur needs when faced with similar difficulties.
For the first time, companies operating as franchise counterparts can also ask a French advisor to create a business profile based on practice in the sector.
McLachlan also reminds people that there is a great deal of help for the first time as Frenchians and entrepreneurs on the CFA website at ocforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will be easier later because the French donors learn to better assess potential entrepreneurs, but also because the first franchise entrepreneurs can give advice and help in the evaluation.
"The work contribution of the first franchise partner contributed to Brian (Scudamore, 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, founder and CEO) in this native building,” says Erik Church, the operational manager of the O2E Brands company. O2E Brands includes companies 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
Franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something that he couldn't have created alone, so the first franchise entrepreneurs have to choose this idea in mind.
Church has 216 franchise entrepreneurs representing all three brands of O2E and is also a Franchise partner of the company You Move Me Toronto.
Chruchi's method of finding the right franchise partner is simple.
"The confidence test we use is to ask myself, "Do I invite this person to the barbecue this weekend?" he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'en', you probably don't want to spend a large part of your working day with them looking for solutions to major business challenges."
In addition, Church points out that O2E Brands is a large part of thanks to its Franchise structure for its success.
In a business organisation, managers often see their position in short term and the relationship to a lower level of leadership very formally, whereas franchise entrepreneurs take up partnerships with long-term objectives and are thus more committed to the success of the company.
"Franchise partnership has much more good sides than traditional business structures, but the partnership is also much more intensive," he says.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational manager.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but well-managed, it produces better results.
Railway delays drop cereal prices in the northern parts of the United States
The delayed rail transport has led to a significant decrease in the prices of cereals in the northern parts of the United States, weeks before the enormous harvest is expected to be under the new pressure of the transport network.
Commercial cereals in North Dakota give farmers only $2.7 for bushel - about a dollar less than the control prices - because of the cost of ensuring the capacity of the tracks of the receiving train, traders and agricultural organisations.
IN Raw materials
The problems are the most acute of the BNSF railways of Warren Buffet Berkshire Hathaway and the Canadian Pacific railway company.
The Federal railway supervisor will organise a consultation on service problems on Thursday.
The Northern plains need to use railways to transport agricultural products as they are far from river networks.
The delay in the transport of trains increased as the high yield of 2013 followed by a very cold winter resulting in a slowing and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that the increased transport of cereal oil from North Dakota Baken's oil slide formation has eliminated cereal transport, which is not true according to the railway companies.
According to a head of an international cereal trade company, the costs of cereal storage and transferable sellers have risen from zero to $2 000 to $3 000 per car per year.
Someone has to pay the costs.
"These costs are paid either by the farmer or by the customer," says the Cereal Store Manager.
The United States Agriculture Agency estimates that the soybean crop in North Dakota will grow by over a third and the spring crop by 16%.
Randy Gordon, Chairman of the National Grain and Feed Association, says: "We are normally trying to start a new harvest from a clean table, which means that the crop has been empty enough storage space and the grain has been sold and transferred.
However, now we start late because of the problems of the service of trains last year.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle the transport of this year's harvest smoothly.
John Miller, Vice-President of the BNSF, responsible for the transport of agricultural products, said that the company has reduced its lengthy transport (train wagons ordered by customers with more than four days) from the start of April, 16 500, about two thousand.
"We have moved almost all of the old harvest we were supposed to move," Miller says, referring to the previous harvest to the remaining grain.
However, the latest speeds reported by BNSF cereal trains were nine per cent lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that development is "inequal" but noted that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year in order to improve the handling capacity of all kinds of products to be transported, such as grain sprays.
Secondly, the speeds of trains in the Canadi Pacific railway company are 11 per cent lower than in the same time last year, but clearly higher than the very low speeds in the first year.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has told the Railway Controller (Surface Transport Board) that its changes to the train wagon order system should improve its capacity to deal with transport during the coming harvest period by 15 to 20%.
The Action Plan of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in autumn focuses on continuous improvement of train speed and effective utilisation of trains so that we can deliver more and more train wagons every week," said the representative of the railway company.
The Ukraine crisis may solve NATO's 'identity crisis'
The leaders, diplomats and experts of the large countries have often been concerned about the future of NATO and whether the end of the NATO mission in Afghanistan will also end with NATO itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as is shown at the NATO Summit in Cardiff, Wales this week, involving 60 leaders, including President Barack Obama of the United States.
The list of politicians and diplomats has no shortage of world crises, even to the extent that the removal of the Afghan troops, which had previously been prioritised, is no longer the most important issue.
Instead, 28 states unions are needed after Russia has re-infiltrated Ukraine, and this is a shocking reminder that the threat of Europe's independence is not necessarily just part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways of punishing Russia, but they will also move troops, promise more money for defence expenditure and reassessment of defence cooperation.
In some sense, NATO is to thank Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) seeks some way of doing its purpose -- and it had a rather significant identity crisis going on," says Heather Conley, Head of the European programme for the Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, but it has also strengthened.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to get world leaders to create a common strategy for the defeat of fast-favoured Islamic State Militaries in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the President will face major challenges in trying to enthusiasm his war-depleted partners for military response, especially for someone who would cross the Iraqi border to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he leads the world to find a strategy to defeat the extremists, having first found that "we do not have a strategy".
Western experts have set cautious expectations for the summit as to whether there will be breakthroughs in Ukraine or the Islamic State.
Additional economic sanctions are planned as the main instrument for the event called the Russian attack in Ukraine.
The European Union officials discussed this issue this weekend, but they postponed the decision on new sanctions.
The US officials pointed out that the countries of which Obama wished for major partners in the Islamic problem are not necessarily members of NATO.
Two years ago, when the previous NATO Summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was governed by the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan, it could not be anticipated that problems could be brought together.
A year earlier, Mr M. Gates, the head of his office, used his last speech to say that the organization has reached the point of "common military negligence".
The US officials continued to complain about the fact that other countries did not achieve their funding objectives.
NATO members promise to use 2% of their GDP for defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, United Kingdom and the United States – achieved this goal last year.
Now, however, the officials of the White House say that they have noticed a change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff, in which they promise to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time the company has a genuine desire for the Member States to observe possible threats to their actual size.
After the Russian entry into Ukraine, "defense promises are more important and more important than once after the end of the cold war," says Charles Kupchan, President of the United States National Security Council.
We are rather hopeful that we will reach consensus among the 28 Member States.
Obama is using a large part of its journey to strengthen its commitment to defence cooperation in favour of Russia's concerned neighbours.
The president starts his trip to Tallinn, Estonia, on a three-day trip, where he meets the leaders of both Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia since Russia joined the Crimea of Ukraine this year, and NATO troops will be regularly recycled in Estonia when a new preparedness plan will be launched this week.
The plan aims to shorten the time needed by NATO to react to attacks in border states, says officials.
The plan includes increasing air surveillance and other visible defence co-operation signs.
The changes have a small risk for NATO, which abstained from establishing permanent bases in eastern and Central Europe as an expression of kindness to Russia.
According to officials, the new plan does not really break the agreement, but it can also be a semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who did not want his name to be public in the context of discussions before official information.
NATO's presence is likely to be described as long-distance, not permanent, the diplomat said.
Putin's an effective "winter"-- is he using it to Ukraine?
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has one ace with respect to Ukraine.
The Western countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of arming the eastern Ukraine rebels and sending Russian troops to Ukraine's soil.
For this reason, the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
Once the situation in Ukraine has become tighter, the Western countries are planning more stringent sanctions against Russia.
Russia, however, has a master card: winter is coming, and Ukraine's main energy source is Russia.
According to the American Authority, Ukraine’s primary energy sources are natural gas (40%) and carbon (28%), Geysar Gurbanov, acting at Harvard University, writes according to Business Insider.
When winter comes to Ukraine in less than four months and coal mines are located in the eastern part of the country's conflict, the Ukrainians will be frozen in their homes when the gas supply from Russia is drained.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, the Russian energy waste, helps Putin win the war at the end, Gurbanov writes.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut gas supplies to Ukraine on 16 July due to unpaid invoices.
In the past this month, Gazprom announced that the Ukrainian debt of gas was EUR 5.3 billion (approximately EUR 4 billion) by 1 August.
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the future winter as follows:
I think that no one thinks about it (the winter) anymore, except for Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to make it easier.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the repair of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to refill stocks, the necessary repairs must be made and prepared for a cold period.
According to Business Insider, Putin’s comment can be considered a masked threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat in front of the Separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman, the Japanese holding company Nomura, noted last month that Russia's speeches about the intervention of humanitarian matters and the planning of a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will be strengthened within a few months if Russia can maintain the activities of the separatists until then.
Moscow has already become a declaration that Ukraine must pay a preliminary payment for the future gas supplies, unless the Kyoto sector pays accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement that would allow the imports of gas to continue temporarily.
Last week, Prime Minister of Ukraine, Mr Jassenjuk, said that Russia is planning to stop the supply of gas to EU countries in winter.
Later, the Russian Minister for Energy Aleksandr Novak said that the speeches are unreasonable.
He said that Russia will do its utmost to get gas delivered to the EU countries.
Liberal Saudibloggari got 10 years of imprisonment and a thousand rapes.
The Saudi Arabian Court has maintained the 10-year sentence of imprisonment to Raif Badawi, founded by the Liberals Liberals Liberal Liberal Movement in May.
In addition, the judgment contains a thousand cuts and a million dollars (approximately 200 000 euros) fines.
The judgment was justified by the fact that he had established a website that degraded the Islam.
On Monday, the second founder of the organization, Suad al-Shamari, told the AFP of the judgment.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was already sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and 600 cripples in July 2013, but the judgment was appealed and re-examined.
The judgment was also complained in May, when Amnesty International also pointed out that it was unfair.
Madventures Riku Rantala's childhood experience in Afghanistan: "It was one of the revolutionary human encounters."
Madventures published today a new book The World Explanation - Avonturist's explanation for everything.
We asked Riku Randala to explain, for example, the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
Crime also tells of the most important human encounter in his life.
The writer, journalist, Madventures, the other party of Riku Randala is a busy man.
Today a new book has been published, yesterday there was a movie picknick at the Citizens' Square and on Wednesday, the second production period of Docventures begins in Yle.
He's been running from place to place since morning.
From the morning-tv maiker to take the child to the daycare and from there to a weekly meeting.
The most face-to-face interview has to be transferred to a telephone interview.
Otherwise, there's no time.
In the middle of all the hurry, he and the other half of Madventures, Tunna Milonoff, have had time to stop and write the World Explanation book, which is according to the cover text of the book, an adventure manuscript for everything.
Everything?
Oh, pretty much promised.
The book reflects a number of themes, such as what is our future, why the other culture works worse than the other, why we are here and who we really are.
We used the interviews we've done over the years.
There are both professors and artists as experts in the book.
Actively, we worked the book for about a year, and Riku will call IS.
You've picked up a pretty big piece of the book.
What is the key message of the work?
The fact that we need to know more about the world and the big questions are worth considering, because then we will do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the book idesis is to be a good travel reader, but it is also intended to make people at home to discuss and share ideas.
The conversation can even lead to action, Riku tells us.
KAUVA: Pete Aarre-Ahto
One of your books is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We came to the conclusion that the human race is optimistic.
Despite the warming of the climate and the current state of the earth, we have to believe that at some point we will make solutions to improve our situation.
The earth is kind of an alcoholic.
First, it should admit that we have a problem, only then can change, Riku philosopher.
Crime says that some studies show that Western mankind has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
This concludes that when we have enough money and our basic needs are satisfied, we are happy.
Money does not increase happiness.
We would therefore like to encourage people to discuss, which is enough.
The utilisation of our natural resources is not enough for a long time, says Riku.
You were also discussing cultural differences in your book.
How does an Indian person differ from a Finnish person?
People don't really differ.
Of course, the starting points for education, health and hygiene are different.
Culturally, the biggest difference is that the Community is much more important in India, both in good and in bad.
After the western countries are prosperous, people live more alone.
Isolation with others can lead to loneliness and distress.
When we find a suitable balance between sociality and being alone, we'd be pretty close to happiness, Riku tells us.
Crime has encountered many different people in the world.
What human encounter has been best in his mind?
It is my childhood, when I was with my family on the first major foreign trip.
We lived in India and Pakistan for a year while my father was there in the work of the United Nations.
I was seven years old, and two of my smaller sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby.
They came home to Finland with a big mover.
We drove a war in Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees on the road.
A girl of my age was walking on the road, carrying her little brother in his arms.
I was sitting on a big sea seat in the hand of a candy bag.
Our eyes meet, Riku describes.
A child of your age will understand the situation.
It was one of the revolutionary human encounters that I will always remember.

Riku and Tunna in 2013 at the book fair.
Then Riku's "going into the clay" that other people need to be respected even if they are considerably poorer or have the same conditions of life as we do.
The crime already realized that money can't be a measure of human dignity.
People in New Guinea are rising from the memories of adults.
I couldn't stop wondering how traditional people live there.
They use natural materials to make use of everything, they don't use money or metal tools.
They live under very challenging living conditions.
It's really hard to survive.
It made me think about it.
And to think about her and Tunna want to get her new book readers, too.
The idea is that our book inspires people to read, watch and listen to more.
To make it work for people from warm-minded love to the conversation or even until the fist fight, Riku throws them.
It's a report from the Kauhajoki magazine.
The events began when the couple arrived in a bus station and ordered a taxi.
When the cab went off, the man in the yard threw a cab after some item.
The driver got out of the car, the same man as the passenger.
The man who was thrown by the image stabbed the man’s traveler alively in the head and in his hand and left the place.
The stabber is a tank of 1,70-175 cents, a man of short hair.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young, pale, pony-haired woman in the vicinity of the scene.
They hope he'll contact the police.
The police also ask for tips from all those who may have observed events or persons involved in the case.
The stabbing occurred on Wednesday 27 August at 7:50 p.m.
"Moi!" said the brain - the world's first telepathic message went through the Internet.
The scientific publication PLOS ONE has published an article that the international researcher group has first succeeded in transmitting the message directly to the mind.
The first messages sent through the system were "hola" and "ciao", which are Spanish and Italian "moi".
In the experimental arrangement, the electronic courier of the consignor was monitored.
The sender was trained with the program to send bits either by thinking about the movement of a hand or a leg.
The imagination of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of hands was one.
This data coded as bits was sent through the internet to the receiver.
The recipient was exposed to magnetic stimulation for each enlightenment to one per encoded bit.
The recipient was taught to interpret flashes as a message.
Researchers admit that it is still an area of research in their children’s shoes, but they believe that computerised telepathic communication is routine in the near future of mankind.
Refugees - Point - Future of the country
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also pressing their own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States to not react when Russia wars in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international policy, action will be followed by a reaction, counteractive action.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only burst in the long term.
Iran was only able to move into negotiations with its nuclear programme after years.
The South African racial government sat in place for decades, even though trade was banned by UN decisions.
Penalties have also been used against Russia.
During the Cold War, no high-electronics or military technology was allowed to be taken into the Soviet Union.
Russia itself has placed barriers to trade on the world's side.
Last time we were in the process, the raw wood store was frozen.
It is clear that forced Russia cannot be put on its knees.
Russians have been used to bad times and Viola’s disappearance from the trade causes panic.
When the EU intends to ban the import of vodka from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians drink the vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to take air support ships to Russia, but Finland cannot take milk.
Gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest harm to Russia is not the loss of the import of cheese or the export of vodka.
The most damaging is the limitation of the financial sector.
They will only affect in the future.
The Russian State cannot operate on the international loan market.
It has to shorten old loans, but it's hard to take a new one.
Although Russia has huge currency reserves, they can't last forever.
Russian companies will receive credit and the money will be expense.
Your own banks are not able to finance everyone.
We need to press more money, or there will be difficulties in payment to businesses.
Competitions are bankrupt in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, the modernisation of Russia will stop, as the Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in the Sanomes of Helsinki.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Without delay, Russia would return once again to Russia and get inwards.
In North Korea, an extraordinary free wrestling event was held
Approximately 10,000 North Koreans, and a number of diplomats followed international repressions on Saturday in Pjongjang in the capital.
Antonio Inoki, a Japanese man who became a free wrestler, took part in the event from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to free-pression, there were also Taekwondo games for local athletes.
According to Inok, the goal of the event was to draw closer to the disputed countries through sports and to promote world peace.
In their speeches, politicians wished for improvement between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan removed the sanctions it had imposed on North Korea as a result of Japanese kidnappings in the 1970s and 1980s.
On the other hand, North Korea promised to reopen the investigation of these cases.
Last time in North Korea, international free wrestling was seen in 1995.
SOK reduces around 110 people from the use goods trade organisation.
The YT negotiations began in June, when the reduction was estimated at a maximum of 130.
According to the company, overlapping activities have now been dismantled from its organisation and responsibility areas have been clarified.
SOK says that it is clearly applying for more cost-effectiveness and synergies between different sectors.
In addition to the decline in economic downturn and the decline in consumer demand, trade structural change, which, in particular, has shaken the goods trade.
The result of the S group's use goods trade has been losing for some time.
The nuclear negotiations concerned all employees and managers of SOK’s use and daily assets trade, i.e. around 530 persons.
Turun Sanomat: Some self-treatment medicines behind the counter
According to the newspaper, there is a need for further medications that you can use without a prescription, but only after advice from the pharmacist’s worker.
According to the Finnish Farms Association, for example, eye drops containing antibiotics could come to advice.
After an interview with the Farmaceut or the provisor and in compliance with the predetermined criteria, the medicine could be given behind the counter, considering Kirsi Kvarnström Turku Sanomas, Chairman of the Farms Association.
In Finland, a few without a prescription are already available, but a prescription for advice is required.
One of these is a post-prevention product.
Corruption to More Causes
Finland draws more and more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is surprised by the low level of mercenaries and judgments in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Justice working group will consider whether there is a need for clauses in the criminal law on the trade of influence and abuse.
Differences in legislation, for example, emerged in the parole of Patria in the case of the Slovenian hara in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
The trade in influence in Slovenia brought a two-year prison sentence to the former Prime Minister, but the Finnish law does not know the same crimes.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has intensified its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to the recent survey, corruption is not much investigated in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a report from the University of Vaasa and the University of Police of Applied Sciences on corruption in various fields.

Many of the Western Sydney Wanderers team players are playing banned in the first game, and coach Tony Popovic hesitates to throw other players in the Asian Champions League witch cages in FC Seoul.
The Wanderers are in Dubai at a 10-day training camp, which also includes two friendship games in Abu Dhabi, so that the team can prepare for the first semifinal game to be held on 17 September.
Because of too much yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole miss a trip to Korea, coach Popovic believes in their cruisers.
"Of course this is a loss – they have been three very important players at the ACL for us," Popovic says.
Tomi Juric, in China, was banned from this gesture.
It's a back attack, no player should be gone, but we didn't have Matty (Spiranovic) in the first game, and until now Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever comes in, I'm sure he's done a lot of work, and I'm totally trusting the whole team.
I'm not afraid to play against who in the semifinals.
The Wanderers will also have to be without Spiranovic, which is still recovering from an ankle surgery.
The defender of the Socceroos team was injured before the beginning of the season, but has continued to run, and it is possible that he plays a return match at the Pirtek Stadium on October 1.
"He's back on the career and he's gonna be fine," says Popovic.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is a great news for him because it means gradual return to the field.
He's already been practicing out a couple of times, which is good.
It's gonna take a while before he's totally fine, but he's gonna be fine.
In Dubai, the Wanderers team has the world's top-level facilities at Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic also feels that the trip to Dubai is a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the major changes of the end of the last season.
"We know that this will help the players to create bonds," Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better, both in the field and outside.
So we use the camp for a number of purposes.
Eliti hamburger pays three times the worker's monthly salary
01.09.2014 21:18 North Korea can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if it happens to be part of the country's elite.
The Financial Times tells about the economic crisis.
In North Korea, the non-formal market may flourish more than ever.
They offer wealthy or sustainable ordinary citizens a luxury that has not been used to combine with a dictatorship state.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: a entertainment center where only a ticket pays up to ten months of regular worker pays.
They'll get hamburgers to pay $76.
That's three to five months' salary for the country's regular duunar.
In the swimming pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and nice.
The 'western markets' of North Korea began in the 1990s when the country suffered a hunger.
The government will allow them to exist, even if the prices of supplies can be at least vague.
Still, in the capital of Pjongjang, many people have a cell phone with a door of $200.
Part of the cause may be the ruler of Kim Jong-un, 31 who has tried to create an energetic and young picture of itself.
During his time, governance has emphasised the importance of technology in the land's burst.

Ormiston House: Stormont Council wishes for sale
The Stormont Council hopes that it has found a buyer for Ormisito House, a building in Belfast that cost taxpayers nearly 3 000 pounds a week.
The Council purchased a building from the 19th century in the eastern parts of the city 13 years ago and paid nine million pounds of it.
The Council failed to continue to sell the building, when the security and maintenance of the building came to pay the Council about 400 pounds a day.
The building was sold back then by 1,25 million pounds.
Apparently, the building will be used as a private residential building.
The Council purchased a building classified as class B of historical value by 9 million pounds in 2001 because it needed more office space.
Later, however, it was found that the building is not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the building was purchased, it was re-saled at 2,5 million pounds this time.
The building could not be sold, and the price was calculated.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt, the Ulster Union Party, proposed that the Ormiston House be able to make a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it will take negotiations on the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building is moving to the new owner as long as the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the real estate broker will remain silent about the identity and sales price of the buyer.
The weekly security and repair costs of Ormiston House are about 3 000 pounds.
The Council bought a building from the police, which led to Northern Ireland Pollicing Board.
By the beginning of this year, the security costs of Ormisito House amounted to a total of 885 641 pounds and maintenance costs of 371 379 pounds.
The cost of professional services related to repair and maintenance was 250 015 pounds and the cost of development and design professionals was 212 466 pounds.
The building was formerly owned by shipbuilding Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was purchased by William Pirrie, a business partner in Harland. Pirrie later became chairman of the Harland & Wolff company.
Shortly after the death of Lord Pirrie, 1924 Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building. The company sold it to Campbell College in 1928, who held it until mid-70s.
"Different value increases": Helsinki intends to reduce school supporters
There's no saving, says JHL.
In Helsinki, a radical reduction in the number of school attendants is being prepared.
The reduction would not apply to the child's personal assistant.
In the spring, the Helsinki Education Board concluded to present a total of about 2.7 million cuts on the resources of the school assistants.
There are around 600 school assistants in Helsinki.
If the contractions occur, they will enter into force in the middle of the semester immediately from the beginning of the year.
According to JHL, the decision increases inequalities.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, it is unfortunately easy for the assistants to reduce from savings because the amount of learning support is not clearly defined in the law.
Savings will certainly not occur, but the workload of the educational staff will increase.
In schools, savings are an even greater risk of dropping from learning goals, and including teachers is hard, stressing Päivi Niemi-Laine, the JHL’s professional manager.
The plans of the City of Helsinki disqualify schools, as small schools and students who need support will no longer be able to receive the helper resources at all with the future resources.
The goal of the City of Helsinki is to prevent exclusion.
Preventive work is being carried out by school assistants.
However, the measures to adapt the educational agency are targeted most of this group.
All parties will suffer from this in the future.
In autumn, the City Council of Helsinki will make the final solution to the resources, for whom I hope to look forward to the future and to act in accordance with its objectives, Mr Niemi-Laine.
Israel Powers Land on the West Bank
Israeli women walk in Gevaot, a Jewish residential area near Bethlehem.
On Sunday, Israel conquered nearly 400 hectares of land in the western coast in the Jewish district near Bethlehem, which may be a sign of the forthcoming significant construction of Israel in the region, and at the same time it detestes the Palestinians’ request not to build further settlements and to defy the public opinion of the world community.
The Israeli "Peace Now" group, who is opposed to the expansion of the western coastal authorities, believed that Sunday events could have been the greatest one-off landing in the West Bank region for decades and could " dramatically change the situation in the region".
The Palestinians' aim is to set up their own country for the countries Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, a political stimulus to assess the situation in the lands came after three Israeli young people were kidnapped and killed in June after they were lifted in the region.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested the Palestinian, accused of kidnapping and killing as the main factor.
The timing of the landing of the region makes it clear that it was intended for a kind of compensation to the population of the colony and for punishment for the Palestinians.
Near the Jewish Gevaot Authority in the South Jerusalem area of Etzion has now been officially declared a 'state country' when it was previously privately owned by the Palestinians. This was a necessary step to allow Israel to start planning buildings.
However, Mayor Ahmad Lafi of the Palestinian city Surif said that the country belongs to the Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news agency WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff published early on Sunday provisions in which Israel announced that they would take over the lands that contain the olive and other trees of Surif and the nearby villages Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Any objections must be made within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people led the Israeli army to a disciplinary return on the West Bank against the ruled Islamist group of Hamas, which Israel says was behind the abductions.
The following tensions at the border between Israel and Gaza came to the 50 - day war that ended last week in Egypt’s ceasefire.
The imposition of the country has quickly brought attention to the Israeli-controlled western coast and revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli government, which hinder the further development of the Israeli and Palestinian peace process.
Lapland crisis areas are usually a number of problems
More and more of Lapland’s municipalities have problems, it appears from a well-being study carried out by Lapland University and Lapland University of Applied Sciences.
There are no rapid solutions to the problems of the crisis.
According to the professor, the reduction of municipal tasks by a billion euros is not enough.
The common features of crisis areas include weak municipal economy, poor employment and migration losses.
Asko Suikkanen, professor of sociology at the University of Lapland, says that new crises are coming from the western border and from East Lap.
In the survey, the residents consider their situation very realistic.
In the study, the residents of well - handled municipalities were even pessimistic.
Weak expectations affect consumption.
People hope that the current ark and well - being will survive, perhaps even a little better.
In this time, you are not afraid to think about longer-term investments, such as buying a dwelling, says Sukikanen.
The research team was surprised by the large differences between the municipalities.
For example, income support expenditure per capita varies from a couple to ten to over a hundred euros.
Tax revenue per capita of the municipality ranges from 2 000 euros to 4400 euros in Ranua.
According to the sex, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How money is used, how much government contributions are obtained, and what is the degree of debt, differs much in municipalities in similar situations, he says.

Great Britain may block borders from returning islamistists
Britain may temporarily prevent Islamistists leaving Iraq and Syria from returning home.
The BBC will tell you about this, referring to the sources of government.
However, according to the BBC, British citizens suspected of terrorism would have their citizenship.
According to the government source, this is one of the many proposals that are being considered.
The proposal is now being finalised, and Prime Minister David Cameron is to present it.
The government also seeks ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way could be to increase the powers of the authorities so that they could temporarily confiscate the passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain raised the possibility of terrorist threat to the second highest level.
Bob Carr welcomes the immediate release of the Australian Attorney Melinda Taylor from the libyal prison.
The Australian attorney Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from the libyal prison today.
The Federal Government welcomed the news that the Libyan authorities are expected to release an Australian attorney Melinda Taylor today.
Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that "it's all going well" and the lawyer of the International Criminal Court will be released to the Australian authorities this evening, and then he will be on the plane flying to Europe by midnight.
"We are happy about the news that he is likely to be released today," the representative commented to the AAP News Office from New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for assistance and support, the representative said.
Taylor's probably going to Rome before the journey goes home to the Hague.
Taylor and his three attorneys of the Criminal Court were arrested on 7 June in Zintani, Libyan city, representing Seif al-Islam, the son of Muammar Gaddafi, former dictator of Libya.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor has taken the Sifi papers that, in their opinion, threatened national security.
Senator Carr has worked hard to release Taylor, for example, traveled to the capital of Libya in Tripoli last month to drive this thing.
Taylor hadn't been able to talk to his husband or his little daughter before last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to call a short call home in Den Haag shortly after the visit of the Australian Ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke with the parents John and Janelle of Taylor in Brisbane, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor’s parents had called on Libya to release their daughter before the third birthday of this little child in July.
The other three prosecutors of the Criminal Court are Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr said a week ago that, as a result of a discussion between a lawyer released in the Hague and the Libyan authorities, "the attorney of the Criminal Court was sorry and apologized for a possible misunderstanding".
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of mistakes, but has promised to examine the activities of his team thoroughly since his members returned home.
"After the final investigation by the International Criminal Court, it will ensure that all those who have acted wrong are legally condemned," the Court announced in his communication last month.
The International Criminal Court calls for a trial to the 39-year-old Seif al-Islam on crimes against humanity during his father's reign, which suddenly ended last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and took an initiative on 1 May, indicating that he did not accept the decision of the Court of Justice to hold the trial in the Hague.
Young newer saved Barcelona - ESS.fi

The collections for the Ferguson police ended mysteriously after the overrun of $433,30,000.
The supervisors closed two online collection sites without explanation this weekend after collecting more than 400 000 dollars for a police officer who shot an unarmed 18-year-old Ferguson, Missouri state.
On an open GoFundMe approval site, two separate pages of similar names – "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" – have collected $235 750 and $17.620 for a Ferguson police officer who shot Michael Brown.
A similar site maintained by Brown's family lawyer had collected 314 099 dollars after Sunday afternoon.
The shooting followed a number of weeks of unrest and demonstrations, mostly against the almost white police forces in Ferguson, the blacks, who forced Wilson to hide while trying to determine whether he shot Brown for no reason.
The network collection campaigns have caused some horror about defending Wilson, especially after some visitors had written a commentary on racist comments that have been deleted since then.
Both pages evidently ceased to accept donations at the same time on Saturday, and the website managers did not give reasons for this.
When a visitor tries to give a donation, he sees a message that says, "The donations are no longer accepted!
The organizer has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, a representative of the GoFundMe website gave the Los Angeles Times a note that the site has not prevented the provision of donations.
"Each organiser of the GoFundMe campaign will decide when he wants to stop receiving donations," said Kelsea Little, a representative of the GoFundMe website.
Organizers may also, if they wish, continue to receive donations later.
The "Support Office Wilson" page, with a return of 197 620 dollars, is maintained by the Shield of Hope, a group of charities made up of St. Louis's police, who is the receiver of donations approved by the GoFundMe website.
Three police officers named Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, who were officially involved in the Shield of Hope's collection register, did not respond to e-mails on Sunday, which requested further information on the collection campaign.
Zoll is an official reporter of the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the nearby City Council of Florisant and a member of the Roorda Missouri House.
The Times also did not immediately contact the anonymous founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, who uses the name "Sand Up" and has collected $235 750. He has not been confirmed to receive donations.
However, in his note to The Times, a representative of the GoFundMe website assured that there is an anonymous charity factor.
Only limited information has been given to donors about the anonymous charity of the collection campaign, contrary to the operators of another Wilson site or Brown donation site.
An anonymous Wilson page charity charity wrote to visitors on the site two weeks ago a message that the page would cooperate with the Shield of Hope to become a officially accepted receiver of donations.
The approval has not yet been granted.
The coroner provided additional information to interested visitors with a Gmail e-mail address under the alias, but did not respond immediately to the request for further information on Sunday.
In his note to The Times, a representative of the GoFundMe page said that the anonymous collection page was removed from the search results of the main site and added that "the campaign no longer meets the requirements of the GoFundMe website that a functional Facebook account should be used".
The information security practices on GoFundMe website encourage users to "giving only to GoFundMe users that they know and to whom they trust".
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the contents of the collection page published on GoFundMe are accurate and honest.
However, according to Mr Little, GoFundMe has been in contact with the organiser of the campaign, and there is no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to hold all the funds collected if it is necessary for some campaign to start investigations.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to hold the funds collected by this campaign.
Recommended Facebook page "Support Office Wilson", who has organised campaigns supporting Wilson, told the followers of this page this weekend that lawyers are trying to find a "explanatory" why donors of GoFundMe have been prevented from donating, but this page did not provide any further information.
There is also an anonymous administrator on the Facebook page and no independent source has been able to confirm these comments.
Arsenal's peak fan on the page of the rest of the year - Valoligiga - Night-Sanomas
The British Valoligiga Arsenal, the French thiefer Olivier Giroud, is likely to be on the side until the year.
Giroud's ankle was cut on Wednesday, and it takes months to recover.

The surgery went well, but he's on the side until he can play at the top level, until the end of December or early January, Arsenal's main coach Arsene Wenger said to Sky Sports.
Giroud was the best painter in Arsenal last season with 16 hits, so the loss is significant.
