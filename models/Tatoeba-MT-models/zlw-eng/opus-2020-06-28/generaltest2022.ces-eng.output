The great return of Czech loser is coming.
Pavel French was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel French, who has been going through his career in recent months, returns to the NHL.
The 21-year-old spitter's gonna be on the shelf, and he could get into the goal soon enough.
Former goalkeeper of Lithuania, Pilsen or Russian Celjabinsk injured himself in preparing for the NHL in October this year.
In the middle of the Vegas game, he has been shooting and has not yet been introduced on NHL’s slides.
The incident occurred when an experienced goalkeeper moved from one stick to another.
“Pavel the Frenchman will be outside about three to four weeks with injuries in the lower part of the body,” announced the whole of Denver at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL goal was finally extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning, American time, he was called from a farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, 94.5% of the operations were assigned.
The root of the Pilsen Hockey guy finally wants to get through and confirm that it belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last year, he had problems with hips and in the short term, he didn't get a single game.
In the NHL “France” he received 36 games, his success in the procedure is 92.3%.
Charles, on his Christmas wish, she's wearing Camille's robe, William and Kate pose in Jordan.
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose family photographs during their trip to Jordan this Christmas.
He also published his wish to Prince Charles, who used a photograph, on which his husband Camille helps to put on a band.
On its website, the UK intelligence station of the BBC informed it.
Worships send to friends, associates, and foundations they work with.
Photographs were created somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duke of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dress in a cup of color, and the princess Charlotte has a dress.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing just like Prince George and Louis shorts and a collar shirt.
Whoever took the photograph, William and Kate, is not even clear when it came out.
Last year, the royal family for a photograph intended for Christmas wishes posed on a pack of straws before a pile of wood in its country residence in the county of Norfolk.
The film, which will serve as a Christmas wish, was also published by the successor to Prince Charles' throne with his wife Camille.
The photographer Sam Hussein picked them up in June at the acquisitions in Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a trigger on his face, helps Camille put on her handle in a colorfully decorated dress with a bright dress.
Slavia according to efotbal.cz promised Berbra a million for the title, the Harder denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption kauze allegedly worked with the accused former Vice-President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr to have a million crowns promised for the league title in 2018/19 from Prague Slavie.
He informed the server efotbal.cz about getting to some of the police files.
The Chairman of the Board of Trade Club Jaroslav Králník stated that they did not commit to any corruption negotiations.
The server published a transcript of police wires, in which Slavia is mainly composed of its local sports director Jan Niemmar, who ended last summer in the Championship club.
Some other powerful red-white worker was in frequent contact with Berbr and former sports director at the time of the secondary Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also in bail among the accused.
The CSIs reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbra promised a financial reward for getting a degree.
2019 won the team SK Slavia Prague title in first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) from SK Slavia Prague's promised million bribe, quoted the server from the file.
A day later, according to the CSIs, Berbr met not only with Nemara, but also with Chairman of the Board of Directors of Slavia Hardiek.
It is no longer from the file to see if the police are still dealing with this information.
The statement of any corruption refused.
Between 2015 and 2017 we were actively trying to change the ratios in Czech football and we offered a negative alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal action, have not sought to influence the referees in violation of fair play rules and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context," said the Report Reporter.
In response, among other things, Nemmar does not choose to insult some former players of Slavia's dark skin, as well as talk of his local boss Hardie.
The case of alleged influence of the struggles through referee issued police action last mid-October in several places including the FAČR Prague headquarters.
The highest in the affair is Berbra, which no longer configures in any of the football functions.
In the middle of January, as well as the local sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks, and bvp are lapping cold wars.
New ones will be made, but in principle worse type (divers must be made from armored cabins and hand-held bullets without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - on a decent level, in addition, have managed to get rid of the Prague V3S even for specialized units.
Airplanes: fighting- decent, but at the end of rent, transport - too small with short bottom, but modern.
drones - little and only small types without fighting potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I've got a story like this.
I'm right next to town.
They went from the river and did damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to do a mess, so I just sat down and the guy didn't notice me.
I was hoping she'd leave before she came out, but, of course, she went for a while.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
Poor fisherman was almost shitting himself with a man on all sides, so I called him and said it was a fox.
Before I got out of the saddle, he was gone.
I mean, I mean, a man's bow was a farce.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it'd have to be a match of lots of coincidences to happen, probably you'd be seeing something in a thermovision that almost everyone has today.
So, in a visible place, dear things, you get your feet in a sleeping room, and you'd be fine.
Private versus Hamáček.
In the morning, the respirators got significantly cheaper than the Health Department.
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of handkerchiefs, masks and respirators for professions closest to the Coronavirus, spent billions of crowns in recent weeks for their acquisition.
The server iZRlas compared the purchases of each ministry and found that during one day the amounts to the respirator differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities did the housekeepers behave?
And why did others buy drains?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to the editor of the server iZlasla Dominika Kubištová.
Soldiers and armies appreciate (I am not affected by memories of ČSLA, which have been completed by the older generation), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory military benefit.
We don't even have large warehouses of technology that could take advantage of training, we don't actually have modern technology for existing professionals, plus modern technology is always more complex, so the skills of the players will be rapidly lost in time.
For this modern conventional conflict, where anyone can put on, they will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
And in the end, workers/territorial defenses have great significance for countries such as Ukraine, where they lead the mass gerile, and it is also an essential need to remove the enemy.
There will only be a fight in the Czech Republic in the conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the geril will be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography to do so.
We don't have an individual bill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is, half of them play as if she had one.
Then you come up with a situation where you look like a loser who didn't hit the open gate for two or even three years, and you say, "so what do you think will happen now?"
Well, of course they'll take him like an average tax collector.
The situation with this skill of "providing a defender" is so terrible that I've come to know that I'm frankly surprised when I see that our attacker was able to play one opponent.
1st flag
Covid pandemic slows down, however, experts for the following weeks do not expect a major twist.
The hospital resistance according to statistical models still lasts some time, and the pandemic equation has arrived, as has been known, new unknown: a variant of omikron which is very likely to spread faster than the present predominant Delta.
At the same time, there is absolutely no certainty at the moment whether it can cause more serious course of treatment, however much it helps to treat or help to obtain a previous treatment of the disease.
The covid equation but this week also entered unexpected phenomenon on the side of plus side: possibility of treatment.
A new medicine has arrived in the Czech Republic, an antiviricavir molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalisation by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be complemented by a Pfizer paxlovid medicine, which has been reported to be up to 85 percent of the results.
However, the first supply of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, apart from the hope of extending the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the Coronavirus pandemic, raised the question of how the future administration here is prepared.
As it was said, the first to reach home patients will be Merck molnupiravir.
The company ended up on the band first and because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find suitable treatment for equine viral disease on the south American continent.
These research often forget that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
they are generally less open and openly do not share their views.
By the way, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, we are used to saying "as the beak grew up".
See if you can do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, the majority will say no to you.
In the West, they'll tell you how they like migrations, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist shit.
And then they go and select sides like AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying this to the public means losing your job and media lynč.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they'll find out what people think.
It's only in France Le Pen and Zemmura, they're both surveyed at over 20%.
We even know that objects in the Czech Republic are three and completely identical.
Identical for the purpose of turning units so that soldiers don't have to learn where it is, so they're all the same for their hair.
One of them is Atom Museum Brda and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, the ssr didn't want to have a nuclear warhead on its own territory, either because of safety or the speed of deployment of heads because of the western position.
In these underground shelters (in each map there are two), only the warheads were kept not all the rockets as they say.
If it was necessary to put this gun on, there was a special unit that picked up this warhead and mounted it on some device.
Besides the museum maple, they're the rest in a desolate state.
At second grade, we had a classmate in Cigan, four years with him.
He was pretty cool, doing good jokes, often too much showed up, but it was our mascot.
He used to have fun with him, often, and wanted to explain something, few, walked regularly, sport dealt with us, did not steal snacks, nor telephones, walked purely.
He drove to school in nature, made various monkeys, but he was fine, maybe never shit.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies entered the same class, another class.
Shortly ago, they beat up a teacher, and they often dealt with something police, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sell something to ad (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I've already sold to the Cypriots, they always had money, they didn't try to get me on the price, the communication in peace.
I even sold my car like this, and the guy called in a month, said he'd already rescheduled it.
I say myself that I'm not racist, I don't care if anyone's white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, until he's acting the way he belongs to a decent society (works, works, women don't beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes in, pulls his hand, winds up flats and houses, he's got a mess around him, he makes trouble... he doesn't care what color he is, but he's gonna bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start doing business, work, learn language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my tradition and culture, I'll be theirs.
Young woman died in a car crash on Prachitick
"The young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and unfortunately, despite resuscitation care, her injuries were sustained," said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson of South Bohemian Health Rescuers.
The havária probably charged the driver who drove the girl.
The 18-year-old Peugeot vehicle driver was probably driving in direction from the village of Žíčovec to the town of Bavorov and from the unsafe reasons he ran out in the turn to the counter.
After the crash with Skoda Octavia, Peugeot's vehicle ended on a roof outside of the truck, described the accident of spokesperson of South Bohemian police Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of Peugota suffered a very serious injury in an accident.
It was a number of injuries, and he was stuck in the car.
After serving him, acute preventive care had to be provided and in stable condition he was transported to a hospital with Czech-Republication, the paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the second car suffered a mild chest injury and was transported to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from non-EU countries, customers often don't supply data about them
Luke Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's holding mostly collector cards.
“ Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say, tens of dollars higher, where it still pays to import, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free,” approaches the collector.
Since October, the orders of small shipments have been slightly outsourced, the new VAT must be added and the post must be forwarded to the customs procedure.
He's got an e-mail saying customs are expecting the package to come.
It is sufficient to fill in the consignment data, and if VAT has not already included a trader on sale, the customs office will measure it from the total amount for the consignment and for transport.
Where the addressee does not provide the customs procedure itself, the total amount must also be added to the transporter's remuneration.
According to Luke Neuheis, the whole process is not complicated.
I'm gonna click one or two of the drop-off boxes, insert two annexes, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a question of five minutes, called Neuheisl.
Not all shipments have been delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of shipments received from abroad from 60 thousand to 15,000 dropped at the international post in Prague.
Moreover, according to Czech Post, it is also a problem that people do not respond to the calls for the supply of data needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments on the international post, which we must process.
If people were to fill out all the information that is needed and fill it out in time, we would be here about halfway, reports the spokesperson of the Czech Post of Matyaš Vitík.
inflation solution
See the headline, how would you propose solutions to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation and is expected to grow further.
What do you think should be done to slow this growth down or compensate for it?
We see in Poland a reduction of VAT on food and PHM, is this for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable of where it goes?
Prices grow faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford common things, especially energy.
How much have you got added (who is an employee)?
I was added to 2% in gross this year, which is laughter, but luckily I have a similar income from business that I operate at work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why violent witnesses are being sent to prison for, like, six months?
This just doesn't take my head how the court can only send a animal like that to six months behind bars just to do it again as soon as he gets out.
Six months is nothing compared to his/her victim's trauma to several years, negatively affects her sexual relations and overall relationships.
Not to mention, the rape victim doesn't have to recover from it either.
Won't this also discourage potential future reports of rape against the victim?
The man from the grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hroba did not want to help officers secure his country-wide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, on whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He brought them to her himself.
He's been doing it with an alley.
First, he approached the passer, and he invented a story that he was robbed.
After the call to the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and weren't ready to wonder when the alleged "retributed" told them that he had invented everything to bring the officers to their place.
In fact, all he wanted from the officers was to advise how he was supposed to make a announcement to the Czech Police Department.
When checking the identity of a man and his girlfriend, the officers found that a woman was on the list of wanted persons, on a national search, and was issued a warrant for arrest.
Therefore, the case is resolved by the HRC.
A sincere question for people here, do you consider our country expressive?
I personally believe that we are no longer ethnic or culturally speaking, but I am interested in your opinion.
Otherwise I agree with me, of course, that Churchill did not succeed in ensuring the release of Prague USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have Slovenian language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can actually believe completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I wouldn't consider such a case to be true faith personally.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, there is an estimate in the world, if I am not mistaken, about 10,000 different religions.
Which god or god does one choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that there is at least one god in some of those thousands of religions that will punish you in a way that you will be able to believe in another god.
But even in the desatre, there is no god but Jahve.
So would it not be more rational to stay faith in any god than to risk me choosing the wrong ones from the thousands of gods, and that one real god I had not just hit would send me to hell or to some place like this?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserve.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per one) and under the command of pros with practical experience.
If a person would do well, he could get a professional offer.
All the ACR files could do something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the Defence University.
We can speak like this: The cooperation between the educational sector and industry, the companies hunt in schools, and there is a kind of prologue, when the workforce migrations from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only when growing up, but this process is ongoing, each of us constantly learning something new, passes from one field to another, etc.
Similar curvatures should also work between the civilian and the military sectors.
I see this as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany, or the Mongol invader will never enter here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something carved into stone, we have allies, and so they'll defend us if there's any kind of trouble.
Well, thank God.
Just one choice in the U.S. that cuts their budget, and all of NATO goes to hell.
Anglans will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles will once again prove that they just show them their backs and get what they want.
For the long term, the only thing that works as a guarantee of independence is the armed army's teeth and the population who can control the military technique of their time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled funds, so what can't happen.
We don't need border fixation, that sucks today, but the teenager behind the remote control book will be able to handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
You unpack gifts under the Christmas tree, and suddenly you're at home with boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is being reused by e-shops, which are missing.
The map of the shops that your used boxes welcome was thus created.
Not just Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring a cardboard box, plastic or paper filling to the involved store (CAMSNIM.cz project map).
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid overcompensated blue containers.
Shops alone welcome packaging, which are currently lacking in the market and also saved money, as the packaging box has claimed by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of green-minded customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One such shop is the TRIRA VERDE, manufacturer of eco drug and cosmetics.
The Krabice and filler material in Popůvek near Brno are carried by individuals who are gathered at home, but also are referred to companies with whom we have scheduled carriages of stored boxes.
We'll use it all when we pack the shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and businesses, we create a more considerate world together.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature by further generations, says Petra Lopušníková of Tierra.
The application www.KAMSNIM.cz, however, shows not only the collection sites for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to remove sorted waste from your home, where to give away any drug, tyres, used electro, batteries, light sources, large volume waste, etc.).
All the wastes can end up in the right place, plus reusable things will find their second home.
The total map of the project already contains over 100,000 of such sites.
"The collection courts, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity camps, SWAPs and other places are being added to it, which help to find uses for things that would otherwise have become waste unnecessary", said Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Uklid Česko association.
I feel rather bad that technology is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or phone play games on it these days, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that students of universities do not understand the principle of components on computer.
Because Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones in general simply hides this underlying filesystem with files and throws everything on one screen in the application.
Let them use the technique as a kid, but let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency last weekend – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he discovered the Presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they would not be able to reach in six months.
The French politicians like it, but they like it and they like it voters.
Macron's supportive dissipation between the right and the left is a good thing for the few, but it is in Europe that it is.
And in France, there will be a new election of the head of the state in April.
The electoral calendar has affected the priorities.
The French leader, among other things, mentioned that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for this work of historians.
A number of commentators have just contributed to the criticism that Macron is a pro-European propaganda and translates history.
In fact, it's what they're trying to reverse history.
The national right-wing candidate for French President Éric Zemmour is now running around France with the fact that the Vichy regime, which in the Second World War was cooperating with Hitler, was not so bad, and has quite a success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of one history book seriously and don't look at France's happening.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn the history as the story we versus them and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, Frenchmen, the Czechs find out who beat who in the battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they'll never know what the bigger context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mys" didn't win.

I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy and I'm not vaccinated.
It was about as "have flu/be thirsty" A couple of days I had a walk and didn't really want to smoke...
It was worse than the regular flu.
I don't have a pass at the flu.
I'm not saying everyone has to do that.

Trains start to ride according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers change.
From Sunday, trains are starting to ride on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some lines, such as between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where the place of Czech Railways begins to ride RegioJet.
For most lines the time of departure will only be adjusted, possibly slightly as well their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The carriers began selling their tickets during the fall.
The Czech Railways plan to manage their new timetables daily on average 6783 passenger transport connections, from which it will be daily on average 478 long-distance trains.
Trains run approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
The tracks next to the national connections within the new timetable will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new timetable, will place dozens of new trains.
The main news will be the InterJet trains that will take the links from Prague to Chebu.
Further new trains will be delivered to northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
Since next year, the carrier has traditionally increased the fare by 3.2 percent on average.
The tracks take into account inflation into their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in RegioJet's timetable is access to the R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier here after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport will replace the Czech Railway.
RegioJet will be daily running 16 connections on the line, eight in each direction.
Further changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop from Sunday at the Havlíčkovův Brod stations, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín.
Leo Express kept his 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia, as well as weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, the carrier was also trying to maintain the most similar driving times of its long-distance trains, despite the planned discharge work.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The transport shall also be changed in certain regional routes.
The changes await the passengers, for example in Českolipsk, where on the line from Mladá Boleslavi through the Czech Lípu to Rumburk will be the place of the Czech Railways to ride the Trilex German company Die Länderbahn.
Travellers will also be able to use single rail fares for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will be increased by inflation 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Do we not learn to see the other side?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how oppressed they were, and had to work, to die.
In my life, I haven't heard the teaching from the slave side or from that time, but no one's defending this, just condemning.
No one will even tell you in schools that black people were often selling blacks into slavery and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one will teach you in school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, only to tell you all about how brutally we Europeans have been killed, killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the U.S., directly in schools, in northern schools, and in Southern.
I didn't get to see anyone intentionally shut down the facts, but I've heard earlier that this was happening, and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (it's a bit taboo in Japan).
My point was that history isn't black and white, and we tend to look at it from today's perspective without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from then on.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never do this again.
By the way, when we're with the Southern states, yes, the Confederate Flag and the famous slavemen there are quite popular, on the other hand they also had some good successes and came to reject them absurdly.
Besides, Sever wasn't much better than enough of people idealize him these days.
And a lot of people forget that not all in the South were slaves, and there were a lot of things that opposed them, too.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, deliberately leaving out some facts, lying and manipulating, even though our view doesn't exist with them (for the YT was also a video from the TV, where someone who started talking about our legionists and 1968).
What seemed ridiculous in US schools was the rise of Marxism and idealization of communism, something that had never been experienced by them.
Overall, it seemed to me that it was awful at some universities, those students were being betrayed enough, and these schools supported them at the same time.
And if I imagine that these people are going to be much older once, then it's a little bad for me that this could be the voice of the majority, because it's both young and ruling elites.
It seems to me that perhaps feminism has long ago reached what he had, and it is no longer about the same, betrayed himself.
Currently, as feminists, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT, leading to radicalisation on the other hand, when it often leads to opposition even for quite reasonable things.
Besides, the more radical someone is, the more they hear him.
Anyway, I didn't meet with anyone judging me for colonialism or slavery, either.
More like I've met the wrong pageant, but it was both sides of it:D.
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely meaningless.
I'm supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do alone?
In addition, the concept of nationality is generally considered useless in terms of some personal identity.
If there's something about people that brings me interests, world views and experiences, not a place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovenian priest is a very nice guy, he's got a lecture more about theology than about politics, but then he always fucks up some cococotine about coronavirus that everyone's ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Church of Czechoslovak Hussite.
Officially, they're Protestants, but they're actually born from the Catholic moderns, and they're actually catholic without Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to the service to the geese because they're a lot more theologically similar, but the members are mostly liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanical Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michal in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominican Republic and even every Sunday at 15:00 makes mass in Latin, as it did in front of Vatican II.
The beach from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the Scouts have taken it from Austria
Břeclav – Plaminek blessed in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ is born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
However, the Scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the Coravir pandemic, but they took him away from their Austrian colleagues this morning at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing.
She was taken over last year.
The Betlém Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we take part every year, I look forward to the power.
It is an honor for me that I have been chosen, told the present journalists the Scouts of Amálie alarm.
While the transfer took place last year at the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, right on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually for him, the Scouts take a train to Vienna.
Nothing changes in the Czech Republic's development of flames.
With the light of betlém, Scouts traditionally went on a train to Brno, where they handed it to the diocese Bishop Vojtěch Cikrlem.
On Saturday, 18 December, Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, which will travel with selected speeds as well as passenger trains.
From them will take over the light at stations of local Scouts or volunteers, who will then continue to spread the flames in the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
This year, the Scouts must comply with the measures in force against the spread of the Coronavir.
It's just like last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of the local actions to carry their hands, try to follow the breakups, they were at least, not singing colleagues, just act as safe as possible, described the spokesperson of the concrete light of Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of betlém light, which dates back to Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace with the flame.
The light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope for the believers, a light that overcomes the darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Scouts have been taking care of its spread for over 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of indiscriminateness and human mutuality.

I don't have economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that the subsidy to cancer economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education will make good use of this money, but I don't understand why the money goes to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned above, it produces unnecessary product and destroys the free market and "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory myself, where there's a million "xy financed/cofinanced by xy" in the corridors, and that kind of company is just artificially held in life.
This is not the support of a company that gives a job x people, this is the beginning of development when this company is holding back and taking orders/workers to companies that could grow after her demise and become more productive
It's a terrible thing to say.
Sometimes even a person born in the Internet is caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I mean, I don't think the Internet ads are gonna move on with me, but then I'm gonna figure out that they've affected me, too - it's just so messed up that you don't always get to do it.
I therefore support the radical voices in the European Parliament, which are now about to give a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all crap, it's classic words - I'd ban the Internet.
I feel that this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe what most believe and it makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I prefer to believe something less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion about which I will claim to be critical."
2. "I will not believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television has fallen through the trend of Christmas films, their premiere has two hundred of them this year.
Los Angeles – Kina, television station and streaming platform in the United States and other English speaking countries have fallen through the trend of Christmas films and will present record more than two hundred to their audiences this year.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years has shown and significantly increased ratings, so these images are increasing.
Four times more Christmas films were made this year than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only pictures that have the word Christmas in their name, so actually it will be much more than that of Christmas films.
The movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, especially fairy tales are associated with this period, worldwide are also popular pictures of Alone at home, Love Heavenly or Classic Christmas Story Life is beautiful from 1946.
The true boom of Christmas pictures but started in 2009, when the special film series came up with the American cable TV station Hallmark, he reminded the BBC server.
Her adventure project, known as Countdown to Christmas, included four films at that time and was very successful.
This year, this station has started by its audiences for Christmas already on October 22nd and will introduce a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
The Lifetime Competition Station has 35 new films with a Christmas theme this year, and also a popular streaming platform such as Netflix contribute to the overall sum.
“In this magical period of story it doesn’t matter anymore, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it snows” wrote with the overweight of this brandon Gray genre, the author of the book about Christmas films called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies I’ll be home).
“For the viewers it is a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm in the middle of all this holiday madness and madness in the world we've been living in for the last few years” Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there will be a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which, of course, will be resolved and these two will kiss.
This is how it's always around, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people follow each other, supplementing Gray.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive sweater will impress!
It's kind of like portable jewelry and the creator put in it six months of work and all his savings.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but not enough experience in our home,” admits Lebanon, who spent 3000 hours in six months over his work.

And it's got one more hook.
“I am completely broke, I must sell the sweater as quickly as possible”, admits Lebanon.
If he succeeds, he will create a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago stood "just" CZK 720 000.

The government has approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Females, drone scouts and pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and build the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO States, in connection with several months of the Belarusian regime’s ongoing actions, which invite citizens of Middle East countries with a false promise of an easy crossing of the Union’s borders on their territory.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating in the Polish territory.
Mutation Omikron spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene's checking out another case of Adam's baby.
“ Currently, we have another suspicion about this variant in another Adam’s child, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the University of Adamov is not proven," said Ciupek.
Six cases appeared in the county within the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant for our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for flu and influenza infection of the State Health Institute in Prague," said the director.
She completed that it was two nurses from one workplace Faculty Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, also two eleven-year-old students from the University of Adamov.
There is no connection between Brno and Adam's cases.
Three of them, according to the director, have a slight symptom, four unspeakable course.
No one suspected Omikron traveled abroad
None of the mentioned were travelling abroad, nor any of their families, nor did any contact with anyone abroad.
There is no connection to the waterfield championship, said Ciupek.
The main hygieneist Pavla Svrčová said earlier that she was testing an international water pole tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago.

California will restrict the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas in an abortion ban.
Governor California Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday the plan to introduce a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the country's mosthuman state by means of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions following the detection of an embryo heart rate.
People would then be entitled to compensation in the prosecution of anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles in California, and under the baton of firearms.
Newsoma's announcement reacted to the Friday opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, who left the Texas abortion ban in effect, against almost 50 years of old precedent, which established the right to abortion in the whole of the United States for approximately 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court has not now decided on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on the technical question arising from the innovative design of the measures.
The enforcement of the prohibition was transferred to the public in this case, making the Texas Republicans impossible to assault him by usual court.
"I am shocked by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States yesterday, which allowed the maintenance of the Texas ban on most of the abortion services and largely supported the Texas maneuver to protect its law," said the California governor.
"If states now can block the review of their laws by federal courts, California will apply this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He said that he instructed his subordinates, in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice, to work on measures which would entitle the public's representative to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called weapons of spirits.
This is how they are marked by a submersible handgun that does not have serial numbers and which can serve to circumvent regulation.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to require damages of at least $10 000 (over CZK 220 000) and court fees from anyone who would produce, distribute or sell assault rifles, parts for “murdering spirits” or sets for their production.
"If it is the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons out of our streets, create a threat of private lawsuits, then we should exactly do so," said the California governor.
The AP noted that California has been prohibiting the production and sale of certain weapons of military style for decades, in June, but the federal judge has blocked the ban as counter-constant.
If, now, the State would actually renew the ban with the use of the Texas template, the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor, who warned the Friday majority verdict against the extension of the legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court of Texas’s prohibition of abortion did not fully express its immunity to judicial review and enabled abortion clinics to continue their actions on selected South States actors.
Every emergency vaccination has its own public test phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination schedule will look like, and it also improves the vaccines itself, based on results.
For example, Israel has already studied 4 doses in large cases.
And according to this study, most patients have a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has already been mentioned long-term effects.
Just like every other vaccination will have a vaccination schedule after a while, it's just too soon for that.
Another fact is that it should come to the market shortly for a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the specification, promises up to 10 times more effectiveness.
It's easy to leave the quantity.
But re-evaluate what they learn.
Since Marie Teresa, our civilization and technology has progressed a bit and the learning of phone lists and describing textbooks doesn't make much sense anymore, and it's really a waste of time.

Poland has threatened to suspend payments to the EU budget
According to Zibroda, the European Commission would have acted contrary to the law if it took advantage of new powers and would have stopped Poland's money paid for the legal state in dispute.
The Commission has already submitted approvals to the Polish plan on the use of EUR 36 billion from the EU Fund for the recovery of the economy affected by the countrywide-19.
And it is under the pressure of the European Parliament to move forward and apply a mechanism to remove EU subsidies from countries which infringe the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the Chief of the Small Party of Solidarity Poland, without which the current government would lose a tight majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will require Poland to suspend its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable given that the EU unlawfully rejects us from the common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish Minister.
Its party takes more radical positions in EU access than the ruling party to Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, changes that have passed the Polish justice behind Ziobrov, they threaten its independence and undermine it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Zibrob, is building “impossible conditions, because its objective is not a rule of law, but a change in government in Poland”.
Warsaw is facing the “political dictatorship by blackmailing and trying to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles”, also Ziobro said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU that is founded on the partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never take part in such concessions to Brussels, which would result in the restriction of the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree to Poland's status as a colony," he said.
But confess in that... there's one kind of cheese in the Lidla in four different places.
I didn't look at other things, I met one yogurt more times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk racks, I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector, they were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and a non-lactoise zone...
Well, if they're fired, they don't get to any market, I don't sneeze, no action, gold shop in the square, maybe they don't have a choice, but they usually have everything I need, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidla to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years, I've been watching her read here, with her dates like manure, most opponents of vaccination is just a little bit out of the bowl than most of the advocates of vaccination.

Comparing apples with pears.
This one's got it this way, and we got it like this.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in these two states.
Ugh, so I'm relieved.
Sorry for the relief, and I wish you all a good day.
I was punished by a cook when I was a kid.
It was never due to grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and to be angry (reading instead of going to bed, washing with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, and Mother always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get a wound (even after another "cracking" of the hot tub only brought it and placed it so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few butt wounds.
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in a reasonable execution and degree) are beneficial because a child responds much more to them than to words.
The important part with a warning is, in my opinion, because it gives the child a choice whether he doesn't listen or get better, and the punishment won't be.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
System Defence
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 answered the journalistic question, what the Czech Constitution means to him – if the sacred letter on which he swears and which she has been learning at school, or, on the contrary, the agreement that can be changed, he definitely appealed to the first concept.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as the state and its citizens, and with changes they are better saved.
And imagine: some peoples even like their rules.
Just like the Czechs like pork and green dumpling dumplings, the question of Vojtěch Cepl was answered.
In recent times, however, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes has become increasingly common among lawyers.
Years are being tested by situations that its creators (with which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not predict, for example, the behavior of the elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions to their texts must be thought out.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can be the key to mastering most crises that society meets throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a sort of rule of rule of rule, consisting of rules which set out the politicians of the mantinel of the game.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we are establishing policies.
At the same time, though, constitutional texts also allow politicians to have their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in FN Brno they're fighting for a lifetime of a month's baby
Although it is known that the Coronavirus is more gentle to children, there are also some serious cases that hospitals have been dealing with lately.
"We know that children are at risk and affected by less than adults, they speak of 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Nowinków, Mayor of the Clinic of Children's Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Faculty of Faculty of Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine at the Masaryk University, Petr Dominik.
The course is much easier, easier, often without symptoms.
However, there are children who are severely ill with the Coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It happens at the clinic for paediatric infectious diseases.
Very serious ill children with Coravir are only recently at ARU.
Children with post-covidal syndrome were continuously treated throughout the year at the doctor’ s office.
"Now is the rise of children with acute covid pneumonia, it means pneumonia, which requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said and added that this disease interferes with adults both adolescents and months of babies.
There are children in severe condition in hospitals because of the Coravirus.
"We currently have a child of a few months and adolescent age," said the primary.
However, he is pleased that in the children’s hospital, FN Brno has not yet experienced any childhood deaths.
According to available data, 6 December, six children aged 0 to 14 died.
According to Dominica, in the children’s hospital – not only in the Coravir department – an integral part of the psychology’s cooperation.
At the same time, he also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, vaccination in children reduces the course of the disease while reducing the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"This is why we recommend the injection of the vaccine in children," the doctor said.
In the calm zone, you can only walk in marked ways.
But the peace zones aren't that big.
You can see on the tourist map on maps.cz.
In general, you can go anywhere in the national parks outside the peace zone (but don't walk through the fences).
Ski/riding in the forest outside the marked route must not be anywhere unless you have an exception (but obviously, it does not look so well outside the national park).
How's the conductor practicing?

He's a full-bodied liberal opera and originally played on a forest corner.
As a singer, he can sing practically all repertoires and as conductor he works not only in the Liberec Theatre F. Shaldy, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajtán Tyl Theatre.
He cooperates with the castle Philharmonic, with film Philharmonic or underkrkonoskie symphonic orchestra.
China builds the impression of the disease managed and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinlog Jiroš: China builds the impression of the disease managed and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has gone to medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing reflected criticism for failing to stop the outbreak that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the countries report the zero inflows infected.
The states, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective aids and many Chinese doctors help combat the Coronavirus, for example in the worst affected Italy.
How do I feel about Beijing?
Is this a friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend of yours is dead, and he says, "Hey, don't you want an elephant?"
I got it, and it's awesome.
The wife is happy because she's saving the weed, she's gonna wash the car with chobot, the kids are playing with him.
Oh, just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
My friend: All right, let's hit it, it's gonna be great.
After some time they meet, and the guy who bought was complaining, the dude you sold for the elephant?
The lawn's down, the giant shit everywhere, the car's disintegrated, the kids fight him, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The guy who sold says, "You're talking about the elephant, you don't sell the elephant like that...
World events are ruled by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states is true, they are the powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such power if it works on its integration.
This still works at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but there is still no military integration.
Personally, I think that Europe is headed for federalization.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different and we'll succeed.
I thought about it, too, and it's pretty possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'll speak.
I'm just saying that ellipsa usually involves 2 different units at the same level.
I'm going to borrow an example from another comment from the Spanish Oranges and Mandarins, when it's clear that they're both from Spain, although they're from the "Spain fruit and mandarines" already in the Mandarins' house, they're from Spain.
In addition, I am assuming that the sentence is "all American forces" including their weapons and that I know that the American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad concept and there is no need to further specify this with the US forces.
But again, maybe I'll just say:D.
Whether it is or not, it's a pointless request

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured Space Milly's Monkey
Scary shots show the moment when a frightened monkey crouched in a toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed it down and laughed at her.
Holland monkey also fed sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Master's court in Gwenta has now repeatedly forbidden her from breeding animals, reports The Sun's diary.
Experts for the rehab of monkeys who take care of Milly after her abuse have said they've never seen such a frightened cosmos before.
Milly spent almost two years of rehabilitation at Monkey World staff in Dorset, and now she is happy to play with another saved monkey named Moon again.
Fourfold mother confessed to two charges of unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks' sentence at a Master's Court in Gwent, with a conditional delay for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, had a life-saving ban on animal husbandry and had to pay CZK 12,000 in conversion.
The head of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the tired animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but rehab will continue."
Milly went on before you got used to people again.
She crouched and hid from anyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she settled down and is satisfied with her male, her view of new people can still cause panic.
Psychic scars from abuse will accompany her forever, supplied Sawyer.
Dwarfing Milly came out after the force at Gwenta discovered scary shots in the groom's phone after a time in her apartment for drug charges.
You can hear Milly's vulgarizing on the footage.
On another video, how does Holland's monkey offer cocaine, and he says, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, along with her partner Russell Cox (43), she admitted to possession of cocaine with the intent to sell it.
In her house, cocaine was found at £1600 (in the conversion of less than 50,000 crowns) hidden in the Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months, and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from this truth three times after you bravely complete the 20th century?
You mean you're gonna take the same things as in sixth grade?
And it all kills the idea of bifloping, when no one, the honour of exceptions, doesn't care if you know or understand.
Just write the test to one, and then no one cares anymore.
Go and on the street at random ask people if you can manage to determine the nature of roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
They've all gone through it, and the absolute majority won't even snap, and they'll tell you that they're in total trouble.
So what the fuck are they learning?
I'm a big fan of generality, and the fact is, people don't want to and don't need to.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get into them anyway.
It's partly taught for a lot of people who need that thing.
But, like, that note that you really don't need all this on your machine stand, I meant absolutely... because you just don't need it.
Besides, we're slowly getting to a time when we don't know them as a punk sign.
But the price of barbarics standing on these machines is just high.
If journalists could count, it's probably never reached those dimensions.

Which is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave now," Andrea answered the instagram in Stories on all questions of curious fans, which disappointed her so that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
Between Kadri and Andrea, it's been squeezing since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move away from her, at least until he returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she rejected it in a resolution.
And as you can see, their relationship not only does it not end in love, but rather grew in mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! He got angry with the turnover of Kadri in response to Andre's accusations of lies, gambling, and debts.
Not even his younger sister, Linda, liked Kadri's utter sincerity.
She's decided to put her brother in public.
Normally, I don't talk about this kind of thing at all, and we never really told each other much about family things like that.
I don't want to make any regrets.
But seeing someone who's trying to publicly hurt and spy on the name of someone I love so much, he just won't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do this on this path, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family even when we needed it when he was young.
I'm more sorry if I have to read such false information that's probably pretty out of context.
I would love to know Kadri as much as I do, our loved one and family, in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what it says, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above everything and know the reality and we know how it really was, added undeterminedly.
The drunk thief climbed into the fifth floor on the facade.
You won't believe what it's about.
He started his robbery Cchao in a parking lot in a residential neighborhood where he tried to enter several cars.
According to available information, in the end, less than 330 crowns were removed from one vehicle.
Then he didn't think of anything better than climbing up to the 5th floor and an open window to get into the apartment.
That's where he stole two bananas.
The footage from one of the security cameras is then caught leaving the street away from the crime scene and eating bananas.
When the owner woke up this morning, he found that bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
Then Ccha's been arrested.
A man confessed to drinking alcohol on an incriminated day.
And given the fact that he needed money, he decided drunkly to break.
The whole thing's in the investigation.
The opielec climbed up the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic law is time-limited and the effectiveness is linked to the pandemic emergency.
If it's cancelled, the law won't be effective.
While the law restricts the scope of business
Isn't that enough for you?
The right to gather will be limited, but not cancelled.
More than 60 percent of voters came to the Saturday elections to represent four municipalities
On Saturday, people voted in the municipalities of Komň in Uherskohradiště, Lužice na Mosteck, Nová Ves in Liberec and in Rný na Pelhřimovsk.
The number of alternates in these municipalities has fallen under the law of a specified number or the elected representative has broken down.
99 candidates were held on Saturday about the total 28 mandates.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest of 33 years.
Working out the results of the Saturday elections symbolically closes a relatively difficult but successful year.
It included a total of squares of new or repeated elections to municipal representatives and above all very closely followed elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said the vice-president of ČSÚ Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the covid-19 epidemic, choices were more demanding for equipment and personnel security.
In the Chamber of Uherskohradistsk, the Saturday elections won the Association of Independent candidates, which won 27.76 percent of votes and two mandates in the 7-member representation.
STAN’s candidates received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means the profit of two mandates.

The mayor of Jan Křižková, a member of the Private People, came to represent them again.
The Komňany – independent candidates – reached one mandate in the representative office.
The urn came 75.48 percent of legitimate voters.
In the village Rownna in Pelhřimov, the association Pro Rowna won.
It received 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent candidates 1 and one of the Association of Independent candidates 2 were added to the municipal council.
Election was 93.62 percent.

Election was 42.9 percent of voters.
The election results will be discussed by the State Election Commission on Monday.
Then they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff.
You're just playing stupid so you're supposed to fight somebody.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to look good).
And I don't care who believes in.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money she recorded, suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all wars that caused, e.g. the 30-year-old
Tl;dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do.
A man fell his head down from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava who had been arrested by rescuers of the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
Employees of the Regional Operating Centre took over an hour after Saturday midnight a distress call with initial information on the fall of a man from a height.
Two ZZS crews, both medical and medical, went to the scene immediately.
Upon arrival at the medical site, they found that a seven-year-old man was supposed to fall off a window from an altitude of about twelve meters and get his head on concrete!
Coal caught in Vitkovice.
But not the way it should be, and the firemen went to the show.
At the time of arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and a direct threat to life.
The intervention physician inspired his respiratory tract, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further measures in the framework of the preventive emergency care of his hospital vehicle carried the further care of the Ostrava trauma centre, informed the spokesperson of the MS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
More fears than from the Coravir I have from inadequate public and public reactions
The spread of the Coronavir in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, but in the first line of the fight against disease, doctors and medical staff are primarily standing.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?

Legendary Nunes after seven years fell, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a wonderful gala full of interesting results.
Things are being done at the UFC 269 tournament.
Julianna Peňová was able to beat the legendary Amanda Nunes fighter, who has not found a slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in a light weight, he demonstrated a great bullying against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly took away Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'malley also beat his opponent.
Surprise that no one expected.
This brought the female fight of the pentam scales between the famous Amanda Nunes and Juliana Peň.
The American entered into each other's battles as a deliberate "travel," which means Nunes didn't lose seven years and munched her teeth on another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was carried out in the spirit of the paper assumptions.
Nunes started her way out of a lot of active victory, and the opponent even gave it a push kick that she sent it to the ground.
But the peňová did not have to make any other mistake, and she tried to attack herself successfully with the levers to her hand.
The second round was devastating, and for MMA fans it was very tight.
Both rivals have encountered a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, the peňová Nunes got to the ground where she started to strangle her.
She had to give up and knock off the attack.
The American made a huge shock for everyone when she became a new champion.
The culmination of the galaxy was a battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a title in a light weight.
At first, although Poirier’s success was better, the card gradually began to turn.
In the latter, he tried to be more active, Olivia, who tried to beat his hand with a lever.
Although that didn't work out too well, then he created a lot of pressure, he got his opponents on his back and put a series of wounds on him.
That's why he won the second round.
In the third round of Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier had a while resisted, but afterward he had to decompress the crushing.
The Brazilian defended the title, Porier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley, a sovereign triumph on Rauliana Paivu, had already set the right back on the first round.
He then killed him with a series of precisely measure strikes and recorded the 15th triumph.
Kara-France then managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
The hip, or the hip?
At first sight, nothing is complicated.
Most of the essential names in Czech only express one grammatical family, and therefore it is not a problem for them to determine whether it is male, female or secondary.
But then there is also a relatively large group of essential names, where the family is not settled.
Such essential names hang between two families.
Two concubines are then leased to the slope and, in some cases, they remain in an inconvenient form.
For example, the words “light” or “heavy” are male and female, in the first one, according to the pattern “style” in the second, according to the pattern “pire”.
For other group of essential names, different shapes are already in the first fall of the uniform number, such as the ‘ring/line’, ‘kedluben/kedluna’ or ‘brambor/brambora’ (in the sense of food).
Both shapes are conceivable and are of the same importance and therefore freely interchangeable.
Some of the expressions may vary regionally, such as the "sugar" in the Czech Republic and the "eye" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is insignificant, as are other Czech-Moravian doubles of words: "kop" and "cobliha", "kobliha" and "coblih" etc.
Some of the words that came from other languages into the Czech language were originally inconvenient, but gradually accepted the Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is both male and female, or the word "buffet", which remained unleavened in the middle of the family, but has a male endowment according to the pattern "garden".
Turkey has opened its way for migrants to Europe.
What's the situation on the Greek border?
There is tension at the Greek-Turkish border due to a growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to issue themselves to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise Greece's support, humanitarian aid is also set up by the Czech Government.
What actually motivates refugees to the uncertain path?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
Three months we haven't seen the blue sky and we choked, described a journalist from Sydney.
The devastating fires with which Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed almost three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the inhabitants of there deal with the disaster?
Could the Prime Minister Morrison government have done more to prevent the drastic effects of the critics?
What about climate change will the country have to prepare for the future?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a journalist from Sydney Iko Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are very rare.
That's why everybody's always talking about it everywhere.
It's awkward for people to deal with sexual violence in our society and how widespread it is, so they're trying to excuse it.
I don't know anyone personally who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've seen how often these people act around them or the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
Trend is finally opening up on his traumas.
But it's still too many people leaving it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who are falsely accused of someone.
It's gross and spit in the faces of all victims of sexual violence, but spreading the idea that "big part of the charge is fictional" and that it's a "trend" that helps only sex violent people.
The Czech Republic flooded houses, families have no money to complete
Prices of construction material in recent weeks and months have increased by more than 30 percent.
A lot of people got caught up in this situation.
For he does not have the means to complete his family homes and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is also increased.
So people don't have enough money to complete their family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, which creates an extremely unpleasant situation.
In a better case, people move into built and uncircumcised houses.
In worse case, houses are uninhabitable, and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay off mortgages and pay rents," says the economist BHS Štěpán Křeček.
We'll build two to three family homes in a year, and it's 50 percent of our lives.
For us as a construction company, it's hard to keep things contractually, even though we've betrayed the material.
So we do no profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Sliveň.
A lot of people are just going to have financial problems.
If they're counting on building a house for $5 million, now it's going to cost seven.
I think some will wait," Sliveň added.
From the material, she was most undercut by copper, iron, and also by installation equipment.
But construction companies also fight the lack of labor.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of construction branches and influx of foreign workers are missing pandemics.
At this point, only the situation regarding the issue of a building permit is more favourable.
"The construction authorities in October issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We're doing fine, and we're getting better.
Real visions are missing, says commentator ČRO – mujZlas
The introduction to the new year, except for the classical celebrations, has traditionally been accompanied by the speeches of politicians.
In addition to Prime Minister and President ANO Andreje Babiš and President of the Christmas Message of President Miloš Zeman and the President of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation this year.
What was the main thing to learn?
It's like, like, a great diploma actually, I have my own theme, which I chose, I'm always working on a bachelorette, and I'm always working on it for a whole year, and then in a week, I'm writing a written part.
The statemen are completely calm with us, if you're not a total poppy and something's left in his head, then the committee won't choke him on the theory.
I, for example, learned a week at the State Department, and when I was in the end, the commission always tried to point me to some logical origin that came right up to me, and I had it right.
Otherwise, I know people who will pay someone to make their semester project (we did it a lot, really beneficial, a lot to learn) and then they just learn the project and have it done.
I think it's great that at the end of the course there is a test to demonstrate knowledge gained in the project, not just defence.
All right, but don't keep an e-mail, phone, and send any packages on the embassy.
You're gonna be the same prick that they are.
Those people at the embassy don't have to have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they'd risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something might happen to them.
But you can easily build a similar statue of Putin next to the Pú bear.
Maybe you could just put her in a way that would put Xi Jinping on his ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws the artists under their feet.
Once every day you don't give stories and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, it still changes what function is more important if the bench, comment, or deposit.
I've been so pissed off lately, so maybe I'll have to cut myself down to a tictok where a lot of artists from my business have a success and don't almost let it happen.
Finally, I would even like to see something user-friendlyly warmer, which does not depress from artists all creativity and energy
Declaration by the Party working on Donbase
They express their views on the image of opponents of the USSR, broken down – yes, broken – no.
Thirty years after the U.S.S.S.R. crash.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
In the Bělovské prales of 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevic, without any legal authority and violation of the outcome of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with an open liberating position of Mikhail S. Gorbachova, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that ‘SSR as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist’.
One cut of the pens “distorted” a huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
The collapse of the USSR has reached dozens of millions of ethnicities of Russian citizens abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has declined by 10 to 11 million.
Even regardless of the loss of the Nerus population of the former Soviet Republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars together!
Even earlier, the same people, who destroyed what was built in the previous 70 years, betrayed the socialist camp (made by the prize of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great patriotic War).
They knowingly deindustrialized agriculture, removed from the world's greatest power from the 14 republics, which had previously been economically linked to the only mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the weight loss of the population, economic breakdown, science, army, growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, war in the Czech Republic, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, NATO expansions east, war and the disintegrating of Yugoslavia, Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, surrender first of the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political politics as a “vacuum of power”.
Everything that was in a hurry was betrayed and given up, quickly enacted and conquered by NATO countries, who accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is shocked to this day mainly because of the events of the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of the product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday, and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it with the fact that I'll put it in the fridge and make it dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality where I don't buy the meat on Monday, it is on Tuesday's chain of discounted 99 CZK / kg - describe the mechanism by which the mass changes its price will become a burden for my digestive system?
Or I'll wait until Thursday and the meat will be 1 day before the consumption date reduced to 69 CZK / kg - what would this meat differ from what I bought by 120 CZK on Monday and leave it 3 days in my fridge?
I'll answer myself, nothing.
These craps that when it's cheap, it must be guaranteed wrong, corrupt or harmless are extremely retarded to tell you the truth ;-)
Now, recently, I went to Hlavas in Brno, and there was a brochure in the basement, and I'm always taking things like this to help the brigs, and they can't fire it...
Well, the brochure was filled with selian reason and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I knew it would be such a thing.
After I read it, I found who did it, and finally came out of scientology.
Well, like he was a good stuff, full of useless lessons, like I'm supposed to be wrong and not be a pussy.
It's a shame of paper. That's why the forest doesn't have to be groped.
I've seen something like this with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with this man because you like him without realizing how much in the situation is.
She threatened me several times because of the fact that I went with a friend she didn't like to go out to chat.
Or when I tried to leave her apartment earlier, she would cry and get me on my knees and ask me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
Cca year it was a great relationship, but then another six months went by and she was bitten on a finger.
Then I ended my relationship with it and told her that I was breaking up and lying to her, but we can still talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch some amateur again.
Such a person will suck up feelings, emotions, and overall joy.
You'd better keep your distance.
If the insurance companies are going crazy about buying a test cloud and going to positive ones, who wouldn't even know about the terrible illness.
All we achieve is complications for companies, carriers and others, due to the fact that their employees in the generator of random numbers had fallen five days in prison.
In the west, they've already stopped the sarcoma and they've figured it's not worth dealing with disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the War is new, and it has something else to steal and fuel that ego by making up the buzzer.
Looks like we're back on good old bastards again.
After several years of narrowing and suppressing this small business, MLM recruiting is again returning to fame.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at the University), the initial promises to train the products and business skills quickly overwhelmed into "you don't need to care, especially get people".
I was sincerely interested in the products I offer, as I wanted to help people, but training was more of a scare and talk to people.
When the first money was made, you quickly realized that if you want to make money, you must find a few certain products a month.
The investment life insurance and mortgages were one profitable, if then you felt like a pot shop.
But what I can say is that experience was valuable, a person learned that he should not jump right on every piece of dirt and review the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial, but they will certainly not boast of expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
In a corporation where I've done so many things I haven't seen.
HR's calm, the managers are looking for their managerial work, and they don't stick our nose in anything.
Regular evaluations are kind of happening, in the form of what it takes for us it's quite going (set up some goals for the next year, for a year we'll look at what's going on and what's not going on) - it's more of a self-assessment than someone would judge you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate actions as well as optional.
But even within our company, we're a little off-road - the department that's more "corporal".
Sometimes you feel like we're kind of like a kind of almost-starter who's gitting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it doesn't bother us so much while the results are there.
The Chešek missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days, the British police were looking for the missing 32-year-old Czech Republic, which was lost at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in the House of Jakub Kulhánek on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradištsk was found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed this afternoon that they found the body of the Czech citizens missing.
Cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we're not going to report any more information on the case.
My condolences, he said to Twitter Kulhánek.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on November 28th when she was on her way from work, before she was hired to pick up money from the ATM.
Her disappearance was announced by her colleagues from work five days later.
After that, the London police began to search for her, Interpol ranked her among the missing people around the world.
It appeared in the Czech missing persons database as well.
Police have held one man a few days ago in this context.
What was his role in the case, and what he suspected of, but she didn't publish it.
At the end of the year, the four municipalities assigned new representatives
On Saturday, December 11, the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice na Mosteck, Nová Ves na Libereck and Rovná in Pelhřimov region voted for a new representative.
The number of alternates in these municipalities has fallen under the law of a specified number or the elected representative has broken down.
99 valid candidates were held in the new elections.
The voter participation reached 62,41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in Rowná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
Mandate got 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years.

There were 36 women and 63 men treated by 28 representative posts.
The average running age was 46.6 years.
The youngest was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
Working out the results of the Saturday elections symbolically closes a relatively difficult but successful year.
It contained the squares of a new or repeated election to municipal representative offices, and above all very closely followed elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to usually work in more difficult epidemiological conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personnel security, assessed Eva Krumpová, First Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last election district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws after approval.
This is the biggest problem I've got with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to cope with the fact that we've got a pretty dangerous infectious disease here at the very beginning, but it went without much trouble.
I'm dealing with how idiotic this is going to be a big part of the population on all its layers, and I'm still having a problem with that.
I'm looking forward to vaccination because he finally makes me less dependent on the fact that other people aren't bullshit.
He would have been deprived of the President's function and the ability to re-embark it.
The chance that this is really going to happen, but how the others say a lot.
In addition, I'm not sure if the stolen file could even be considered treason.
This is an act that the President of the Republic will threaten the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic nature of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
As the pandemic affected the intimate life: the growing number of people up to 35 years of age, who are without sex all year round
More and more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
This is mainly about religiously founded people, reports the DailyMail daily web.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the share of younger 35 people who have become sex-related has risen from eight to 21 percent.
A woman between 18 and 35 who said that in the last year of sexual intercourse was more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, showed an analysis of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these could be the economic impact of the koronavir pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks or video gamers could also contribute to making sex less and less priority for young people.
"Since 2010, the share of men and women has been rapidly growing between 18 and 35 years of age, which states that they did not have sex in the previous year," IFS Lyman Stone researcher said.
In people in marriage, sexual activity is more frequent, in 2021 only 5% said that they were having sex in the last year without sex.
Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 was only a small percentage.
The fear of pre-marriage and religious establishment also contribute to the loss of sexual activity.
Although husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married younger than 35 years is still decreasing.
Young people think about pre-marriage sex, about 30% of it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among single individuals in this age group are minority, but their behaviour shifts this trend," Stone talks about these thirty percent.
Most of those who have a moral problem with pre-marriage are grounds for religious establishment.
Since 2008, for free people under 35 years of age, more than once a month, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
The trend from 10 to 20% was raised among the “less religious”," said Stone.
Further factors, such as less social interaction and especially social alcohol drink during pandemic times, contribute to the decline of sexual activity.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is lower in people without work or with lower income.
Another reason for this could be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, making this need “almost.”
This trend was mainly caught behind the blockdown in the time of the Coronavir pandemic.
The whole setting of vaccination against covid is whether a society should force part of the population to behave that they do not want, but which can save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question that I'm personally interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question is whether if we don't order it and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly hear some disinformation for the death of a 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, and as a result, he didn't come out and finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think that we can be the death of a hard-headed immunization opponent here by the SPD and the KSČ who baptizes something about bullying and the totalitarian state.
Of those statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clear that most of the unoccupied pensioners are likely to belong to the second group, so they will actually be able to do so themselves.
Czech Republic with no snow.
How does moderate winter sign up for the fight against the dry?
This year's winter in the Czech Republic brought one of the smallest snow shares in the last time.
The operators of ski resorts will not be able to meet without technical snow, the weather also complicates the preparation of cross-country Jizera 50.
Is this about the trend or the exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight the drought in the Czech Republic?
I should have one story, but it's not about a gentleman.
One time in high school, the teacher led us all over town to the shipyard so that we could ride on the boats on the river.
On the way there we went one of these quite wide streets, and whom we probably don't see in the middle of it - a supporter of the sect of Hare Krishna.
Of course they fell for us.
Thankfully, I ran away, but one friend and one of them got into a speech.
When she left them, we asked her the teacher what she told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, were laughing all the way to the yard.
We're so spoiled.
There's not so much going on, but the system's falling down, says Orozovich.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, following previous visits to Paris and Brussels on Sunday, arrived in Warsaw, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honors.
"We are opening a new chapter of relations," Morawecki said at a joint press conference after the negotiations.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the border of Ukraine, is desirable, according to the Chancellor, to deal with the use of diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the 'normal group', involving France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that the Chancellor informed about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially caused a migration crisis and used people like live targets and guns, because we record a hundred attempts on (illegal) crossing the border every night.
With the Chancellor, he dealt with other sanctions to ensure that Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in Kremlin finally understood that we were determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz, according to DPA, assured Warsaw that in dispute with Belarus, it enjoyed German aid and condemned the inhuman treatment of Lukashenko’s regime with runners.
The drunk Polish craftsman caused an accident, tried to hide it.
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was driving another nun who tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she might still have no priority in driving and driving from the scene of the accident to lose her driver's license, she went out with the truth, said TVN24.
She admitted that another nun ran into the vehicle asking for help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestin.
They set her up with a breath test, and after they found out that she had more than two fluids in her blood, they immediately took her driver's license.
At the same time, they told her she would testify in court.
Hugo's dog is doing his best.
Juraj Shaymovovich but he didn't watch his movie.
Czech creators of family comedy saw in American stories about dogs lovers.
But they forgot about the important thing: the legality of the film craft.
After the cobce movie F. Brabce Gump - a dog who taught people to live, now another film is missing from the cinemas.
Co-author scenario and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič ml. freely binds to his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
The speaking lamb Hugo is returning to the scene and some of the familiar characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Chumava guesthouse, who compose, and so begin to consecrate them, Julia's father and partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who has first love.
The director and partner Beatriz Šajmovicová (which is also a film producer) were dealing with the reporting procedures already in the previous dog's picture, but they had a lot of fun with children and dogs.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script that caused a mixture of amazement and embarrassing feelings.
Let's get this straight.
Julie, although a scientist, is in desire for a child of darkness and if the right “constance” comes, he copes with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates determine – on the hood of the car or church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with the local guide), served Colonel Mojmír in spite of the summer training shoots his own daughter (Julia), who falls into a coma, while the family is taken away from the hospital, so that in the heart of Shumav's solitude can perform a miraculous process of dog healing.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the strength of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer, however, wonders what contents of the chamele full of unfaithful situations and figures were needed for this message.
Double thief from staff, pessimary competition, Šumava charlatan, police coming to give a gift to look for "the drugs" and discussing herbs about fertilized bone flour – and which cooked the family in the guest house will drink, of course.
When the heroine wakes up a heavy coma and sits in a naondulated and stuffed with a cigarette at a family table and requires a father's whiskey and flots as a cured vegetarian, you can't laugh.
On top of that, the viewers will explain that “it is what happens after a coma.”
Šajmovič's team lacks the basic dramatic knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build a situation, a sense of character and point character character and direct management.
Actoric performances are unbalanced, cut helpless and overall impression.
However Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová are trying to stop their party, they have not much to play.
The film's only product remains the poetic images of the Shumava nature cameraman Vladimir Holomek and a pair of stags.
It is not enough to sketch some characters, a chaty plot and a dog speech, let alone the more humane vulgar expressions that the characters commit.
The argument is not even a flight membership in the Jitter's Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of a man with a dog must also be knowledge of the craft, if a man wishes to tell a true story.
That didn't work out in this case.
For a good family shot, there's a little bit too much erotic and a minimum quote for the genre.
Even as an ad for a canisterapia, this amateurly understood piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant ingestion from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and forced, here's how you understand shit, but that's just because you never tried it.
The decision is always on the customer, if he doesn't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to such a lot of things, maybe you'd change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in which case there's a career brigade.
The Middle East is suffering unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time in the year when it rains.
"Such a complete absence of precipitation during November, as we noted at certain stations, is unusual," says the Israeli weather service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of the long-term precipitation average for November.
The two-day rain from this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It's been a while.
It's also the right Christmas scene, the inhabitants of Nazareta Wasi Askar rejoiced.
The slaughters in Israel come only in the winter months, and are irregular.
There are addicted forests on the winter rains.
Without them, they're quick and prone to fire.
It is not just the forests, it is also about the supply of drinking water and a funk for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Galileo lake, was filled in the spring due to the three last rainy winters.
There's been a decline in the surface ever since.
Vodohospoders warned about drought a long time ago.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, the speakers of the Israeli Office for the Water Management of Uri Schor are likely to be subject to precipitation in 2018.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination or recycling of waste water.
The worst are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there is a tank wagon.
Water supply and private wells are dry.
“This year, orders rose by 70 to 80 percent compared to two previous years," Imad Sulejman reported in September.
In Iranian Isphahagen, conflicts between farmers and security forces broke out.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The Korytos of the local river were completely waterless.
The region has the driest November in the last years.
Israel is preparing military action against Iran
The Israeli Defense Minister has stated that no progress has been made in Vienna and that he has informed Washington about the preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
On Saturday, the Minister Benny Gantz declared that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
The Gantz who lives in the US is trying to convince Americans to put their pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and the world power “ understand that the Iranians are playing with them”.
About 3 years ago, this happened to me.
I've been doing my homework and grilling during the interview to find out what she wants from me.
Finally, I found that my suspicions of the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I've been in doubt about the questions and questions for a while, and he's finally thanked and left.
You can tell me I'm a jerk, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers went to the mountains on the weekend, waiting enough snow and nice weather
The mountain resort in the Czech Republic experienced the first major support for skiers this weekend.
After an extensive snowfall at the end of the working week, it is not about the emergency and some skiareals have started operating.
The convention did not dissuade either the obligation to prove itself with the ticket certificate.
While the trainlers are not complaining about customers, some ski equipment lenders report less demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region went to the crossroads as well.
Skiers wanted weather that offered the sun today and excellent snow conditions.
“We are satisfied, this opening weekend has really come out of the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill”, said Ještěd Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went to Jesenik during the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov or the Centre in Branná in Šumpersk have been opened.
The weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today it was estimated by 400 people.
The terms are super.
Today the sun was lit, it was about minus three degrees, so the perfect, did not spare the praised representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Skiareal operators can only sell skipas to people who are vaccinated or are within a period of time after sharing the disease.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared for this and prove the necessary evidence, said ČTK René Hroneš from Špindlerův Mlýn Skicentre.
"We only recorded the units of the incidents," he added.
Lower interest than pre- Pandemics report some loans and shopkeepers of ski equipment.
Happily, the interest in ski rental is.
It's not like in the past years, but there's still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Bukiš from the monkey store Skiopava.
The greater support is expected during ski courses.
Also member of the Snowbear Society David Šinták feels that due to covid there is no interest in renting ski equipment as early as it was.
This time before the pandemics, we were almost lent off.
Compared to the time before the pandemic, we had about 50 percent, said ČTK Šinták.
People thought they were lazy with pandemics and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by the rental house in Novako on God’s Dar.
By borrowing the skis there started a week ago and the candidates now have to order them in advance.
“We are starting to borrow this weekend, but people have already called ahead so we expect a great interest as well as last year”, said Pavlín Novák, the operator of the complex.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also the result of a ski school.
If we want success and rich people not to go abroad, they must be able to experience a good life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialistic health, where it is often not possible to find dentists or physicians specialist.
From abroad, smart people who have no property are leaving.
The owner of the company abroad really won't just walk away.
With the rest of it, yes, yes.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic, and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will simply live in the Czech Republic.
Emigrants from Hungary began by one beautiful day winning Orbán, the year reigned and suddenly the annual emigration picked up by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is the election.
If he lives here stupid, he can also win some traditional V4 madman.
Young people and educated people will leave, remain his supporters, and people whose assets cannot be put on the plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood for a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic was in the full stream of autumn, in Thailand the staff of Ostrov film led by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
On social networks, actor published bloodthirsty photos of his face.
Is this a real injury, or is it a trial for filming?
The London police are still looking for missing Czech Republic.
Last time she was seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petra does not look like her behavior at all and we are starting to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in Lambeth, where Srncová worked.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech thought she left work on Sunday, November 28 at about 19:45 and headed home to Camberwell.
Last time she was reported to be seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her coworkers on December 3rd.
Srncová, according to the British media, acted as a “sister of health nurses” at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs under the Guy's and St Thomas hospital.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," said the group of health establishments in twitter.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the message continued.
The public is also invited to cooperate by Mrs Harriet Harman, who has alerted the Srnce case on Saturday at the press conference.
“She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried about death," said the Labour Policy, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
“I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her, because she was outside her home country, away from her family and worked here for our health care," Harman said.
Police have already held one man in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what a man is suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
I don't appreciate Ukraine like that, either.
It's not a huge amount, but it's about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that the threat of invasion is increasing and begins to have our entry full of teeth.
I was quoting upstairs.
I don't know what he thought Russia wanted war.
War is bloody expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparing the situation in 38 is out in so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare that with the first punk war and the "anexi" silice:D
I can imagine that, after Ukraine has announced that it is not going to comply with the agreement from Minsk, Russia is taking up those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's how the concentration on the border would fit.
Well, pacta son of a...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, affecting mainly urban connections
Passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are waiting from Sunday for several changes relating in particular to urban connections.
New lines have been developed, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslav is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital since Sunday there are quicksands from České Budějovice in the station Garden Town.
In the city train transport will take S7, which will take place on the route from Beroun to České Brod through Prague's main station.
In the recently operated station Prague-Záhradní Město will restop R17 from České Budějovice and Benesov.
PID will now spread to other areas.
Among other things, the buses will go to Light nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Old Spas and Turnov.
Buses will be included in Mladoboleslav region, including a line with an extremity to Liberec and the Royal Region.
When integration is cancelled 77 lines, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be adjusted.
A new bus line of 405 is coming out of Prague Zličína, which goes to Žatce.
A new direct connection was also developed between Prague – Kralovice and Rakovník, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be strengthened in the morning peak and on the weekend the connection from Prague to Rakník, when the express line of 404 will start.
New links 400 and 410 to the Liberec region are included in the PID system.
They're driving from Střížkov Metro Station, not from Hádraž Holesovice Station.
Host line 400 goes through Mělník, Dubou and Czech Lípu to Nové Boru and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional 410 line goes through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, in addition to the Jablonny in Podještědí.
On the contrary, the new operation on the tens of Central Bohemian local lines, including Mochova, Dobříze or Rožmitíl pod Třemšín, is cancelled or limited.
All trains with departure from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of railways, long-term restrictions on Prague – Beroun, Praha – Lysá nad Labem and nearby Kolín continue.
The changes await passengers also in other places.
Buses replace certain cancelled rail lines or expands the section on line 420 from Dobříze with links from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevska.
The transformations have reached the lines of 540 to 543 in Nymbursk and certain buses are arranged on the border of the Central Bohemia and Hořovica in the Pilsen Region.
Healthy lunch/breather at the supermarket office
Hi, I'm doing classic 9-5 with a break of 30min and my only chance to get a meal is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidla.
Because I don't have any movement after work, I don't have the power to practice, so I have to eat as healthy and dietally as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and at speed I'll buy the maximum pizza bead and to snack yoghurt and apple.
Question: what healthy without the need for a heat adjustment would you recommend me in a supermarket to buy?
Not everybody's waiting on a meter of snow like you, unfortunately it is.
And it's not about trees that you need to necessarily see.
Only the tip of the tree can be hidden under the snow.
If it destroys, the tree can be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason they're not gonna let us ride outside the slopes, but it's one of them.
Appreciation of the Gift of Relationship with the Bad: I was not happy about this at all.
Since Friday, the Czech Showbyss pond has lived nothing but the discovery of the relationship of Dary Roles and Paul Nedvěd.
They've been pulling it together for years, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
The gift now sent its fans an extensive message explaining why she kept them in love for a long half-year.
“I dare say that there is no one currently in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have escaped that Dara caught a bear, I mean, a pardon, Nedvědka,” jokes Dara Rollins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer in the ears.
He said he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but we knew that this would happen one day, the singer continued.
I just don't know who's worse.
If the ones who don't care about it at all and it pops up on them and out of the canned cans, or us, whose full lives distract.
As if one of you wanted to hear the opinion about whether you and your husband and girlfriend are good enough or insisted that they all really know the list of your former partners and be familiar with the reading of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's a frog, you want it, bothers Laura.
Doubles got together in Italy, where Rovins was riding in order to prepare her new fashion collection.
He's been acting as vice president of the Juventus football club for a long time.
The truth only went out now because they were waiting for Neadsto divorce.
Ivana and her wife have been separated for three years, paper's not married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We're just people too, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
Therefore I love my new man, and as he did with me, I stand with him. In good and bad, Rovins closed.
Hey, the other commentants probably said everything important, but I'm just saying that the colleges are great at the beginning, my classmates usually met in the first semester or two friends and then they found a place to live together, which makes me feel like the best option, because you know who you're gonna live with.
The apartments don't usually go way ahead too long, so I guess you won't find much to do this now, but I'm sure it won't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, you should not only get out of Cejlu, but also the surroundings (e.g. Vranovská, French etc., this is a pretty bad address), as well as some of the Jewish parts are a little ghetto.
On the other hand, the district of Veveří is very student, the King's field and it's fine in that direction, besides, it's close to most VUTs (I don't know where you're going exactly).
I've never been looking for rent, but I'm a native Brn, so maybe I can consult Brn like this if you have any more information:)
But that's an example of a completely normal reasoning.
As a result of what several doctors decided to do in Poland, it is actually perfectly okay that the state does not fund certain schools enough.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it from their own or whether they go by state or pay the state.
After all, we cannot let a private actor control a piece of education because he will pay a few crowns for a full national contribution and that will enable him to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim is somewhat lost in weight when it is written by a person who spoke two days earlier about a petition action for the boycott of the totalitarian State:
So the vote against if anyone goes to abortion is the same as the vote against a statue standing in the square for you?
I'd be consulting you directly with the guy who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already seen it (and it's been years of professionals) either from the eye, or they're going to put something on the way xxx *** or ... (by convention) and to notes that it's incomprehensible.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I wouldn't exactly recommend it.
Personally, I'd be able to deal with it somehow in a note based on what kind of program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and demanding student, you can look into some character databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd say that the author or printer simply created his own character, which fits what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't it more like the Odry Empire than the OdryNská?
PSS: Someone's already said good-bye.
Look at this comment with γρH
Politicians have no idea what our Presidency's gonna say.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is smiling.
All important approved documents examine the word from the word, and yet some basic knowledge of English isn't enough, that's the business of lawyers.
In different EU institutions, hundreds of translators and interpreters work, English is more suitable for informal contacts, over-standard relationships.
Moreover, it is quite interesting with the English one, after having performed GB from the EU.
I don't understand the Cejl hate.
I've been working there for the third year and totally fine.
How many times do I drive from work at 10 a.m. and never a problem.
Just saying that's a ghetto that can only be said by someone who almost didn't walk in his life.
Yeah, they live there about most of Brno's Romani population, but all they do is cross their way to the sidewalk and park where they don't:D definitely isn't that I'd be afraid to climb up there tonight.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I'd be able to do it.
A lot of apartments are now refurbished or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dad and his mistress Gelem as a stake in the fence!
Who's she gonna spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on the adventurer lit the first candle, Felix Slováček no.
I don't have an advent wreath, so there was nothing to burn.
I've seen the wreaths, and I'm sure Lucie has some, too, said the Flash saxophonist, who so confirmed the word Patras was often visiting her.
She's visiting, but she doesn't live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada stayed alone after he left.
Slováček still doesn't know where he'll be at Christmas night.
We just met Anik, Felix, and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: ZOSE SPOLU!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: ZEZE SPOLU!
But we kept talking, so it didn't come to Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm gonna be.
I buy gifts on a continuous basis, and I'm sure I'll buy something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, he added Felix, who himself came to the baptism of music video at Richman's club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I will always find someone I like to have fun with, says the Slováček who was happy to meet the wife of Ludek Soboty Adrian or the singer Kamila Nývlt.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone's going to defend us for us and our location is so strategic that an aggressor has to be a complete idiot to keep this territory out of control.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know any other file that could be deployed in a crisis in hospitals.
The cops are little, and they can't afford it, as well as firemen and nowhere else is such a high percentage of well-trained people on such a level.
And the fact that our army is capable of defending only Ostrava goes to the head of previous governments, not the army, asking for new toys for long enough.
Record dry in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not just be a food factory, says the journalist.
Czech Republic has been going through the worst season of drought in recent years.
Waters, according to scientists, have remained in mountain and mountain areas, smaller precipitation rates are recorded in places where there has not yet been a need for influence.
The cause of drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
However, the impact also strengthens the way we manage the land.
What about the dry preparation?
And how can we help nature in hard times?
Yeah, well, it's gonna be like that, but I'm barely gonna stick to ice skates, I know what to do with hockey and tactics (which I've tried at French Hockey Manager) is also a total haluze.
And whether you're a hockey team of "mold Russia" or "Lama China" so lose two goals even if you don't have to win at any cost other than when it's compared.
But anyway, as I listen to Czech commentators, what the referee notices, whether male or female hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
The controversy is everywhere.
And if the opposite is the way it's always been, and the Czech Republic and Russia lost more often than they won, it would probably be the classic "voni lost" vs "my win".
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
There are 5766 people in hospital.
In total 34 451 died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic 1967 at 100,000, 871 at 100,000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29 929 new diseases have been registered.
It's the lowest number of days since October 13th.
The total number of diseases registered in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it is the lowest daily number of dead since the end of October.
Britain is facing a large wave of disease caused by Omicron, said on Sunday on television by Dr. Susan Hopkins, the main medical adviser for the British Health Authority.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Persons infected with octocron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects to grow.
So far, no one has died of omicrons, but hospitalisation takes place for about 14 days after the disease and death, about three weeks after the disease.
The British Labour Chef Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson probably broke the law by last December when the blockdown was in place and was forbidden Christmas parties, organized a Christmas quiz at Downing Street.
One minister of Johnson's government argued that the visa took place “virtually”, over the computer.
Of course, it was attended by a group of employees in Downing Street, gathered around computers.
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from Prime Minister's office is increasing.
Last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson was organized by ministers despite the blockdown of numerous parties.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government were making fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial television for Britain: Two years ago, Boris Johnson won by a overwhelming majority in general elections.
This morning, the Consumer Party is talking about the need to be removed from the function of the Prime Minister.
It's remarkable how quickly events have evolved.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for spring elections that can end with Viktor Orban's twelve-year-old reign.
It will be the choice of pan-European importance.
How much can they expect to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't even be single because they weren't even the last two elections under Orban.
His Fidesz side controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit from it, and makes other smaller or bigger tricks.
So far, the last one sounds like everyone can vote anywhere they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to bind voters from determined districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
I mean, the situation is different.
It used to be, not if Fidesz wins, but how much and if he has a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will get a united opposition.
It's a big habit for Viktor Orban and his side.
Won't they keep the power to play harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, she has escaped to independent media recording by the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövere, where the secret service chiefs reports that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
It's all starting with your tongue.
I've been beaten quite often, for the last time at 14, my mom's parents aren't very patient, neither do I, Daddy has long, but then she's gonna blow extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and angry as a little awful, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a cramp and was all blue, it was about two times under the shower to calm down.
They used to spit in my education, sometimes they didn't know anymore.
I certainly tend to deal with things with violence as a kid, and now I'm getting into something, and as a younger man, I like having to give my parents a pat over my hand like that (so I don't get too much over her hand), so I've never had anything extreme, but I always need it.
I'm not able to determine how much it's my explosives, but I'm sure that's part of the upbringing, too.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose my patience with my kids, too, and deal with the same thing.
I think that beating kids is just wrong and that my parents didn't have to do it, especially not at the moment when it wasn't “student,” but from frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent is just shitting something, I don't think it's possible to get his kids back on at least a little bit, so I don't blame them.
I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
The laws are to be clear and clear.
I would then call the Kundami the ones who form laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product and you get a mortgage from what?
Kočner's vast world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial with the killers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with four defendants charged with the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of the investment reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She started a civil society, but she also revealed practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and its involvement in tops of Slovak politics and justice.
What fundamental break will the process for Slovakia mean?
These huge journalists can do it.

The next government ends and the municipality involvement law in the selection of non-households
Mr. Karl Havlíček's proposal needs to work substantially
Prime Minister Andreje Babiš's government is at the end and the law to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens when selecting and authorising deep storage of highly radioactive waste is still not there.
The Legislative Board of Government has interrupted the discussion of a proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the Government after the summer breakthroughs.
Its content is in serious contradiction not only with the municipalities involved in the Platform against the Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Cities and Cities of the Czech Republic.
The self-governments from the law expect to strengthen their capabilities when deciding on the repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation has started and required the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will re-examine its proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law by the Minister Karl Havlíček, who has the Platform available, is addressed by the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the selection process for storage sites is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can be really effective only if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will even continue in the site.
This can be ensured by the imposition of an obligation to manage storage, to require the consent of the municipalities concerned prior to the start of the specific management.
The draft substantive purpose almost completely forgets the public's involvement and makes citizens of municipalities virtually mere statists in authorisation proceedings.
The proposal lacks a systemic compensation setting for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a site for storage, its authorisation and operation.
National leaders in the current legal standards do not have much to defend the interests of their citizens in finding a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they submit their comments or appeal, but the Office or the Minister in whose interest the authorisation is to issue.
The case-law does not have a permanent effect on the conduct of research or building works.
The co-decision of the authorities that the Platform requests is a principle commonly used in many democratic developed countries and certainly in those where they have already advanced in the authorisation of storage sites, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, moreover, another failure of state administration, which hires external law offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., concluded by SÚRAO and linked to a contract with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register, the total sum for these works is to be subject to a total of CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, Deputy Mayor of Cejle, from Hrádek and spokesperson Platforms against Deep Storage, said: After the Ministers of Industry, who compare the position of self-government against the state authorities when searching for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste, we expect a more significant turnover from the new government.
We offer a helpful hand to do so.
We would also like to thank the Association of Cities and municipalities, which the issue of the lack of rights of municipalities with such a fundamental structure is similar to that of the municipalities concerned in selected locations.
The platform against deep-sea storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to enforce changes in the state's access to spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited only to deep storage.
The platform further advocates that decisions on the selection of the site for potential storage should be conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Herce John Goodman (69) forced fear to lose weight: He threw 90 kg.
Although in his life - style for many years, he had no need to change anything, eventually the doctors scared him.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight 180 kg, reports The Sun's diary.
He boasted his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of The Fresh Brothers.
There's another man from the Roseanne sitcom!
John liked to joke about his friends and his family asking him to lose weight because his great body caused a crack of furniture.

It also matters what boss and what word you want to use.
If it's about some text on a platform that expects a player from a game environment, I wouldn't even translate it.
If it was a formal text or a college text, I'd probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more bosses to everything.
For example, the game like Dark Souls etc. has bosses a few that yes, and so is the "boss" something like the master of a given level, and then there is a final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), who do not need to beat at all, that the game or level is finished, but often they are even stronger than the standard boss.
Then are the games of the Half-Life type, where bosses are, but the player doesn't make direct calls with them (Tetacle, Gargantua) and they can even call them?
And then they're mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate the boss in one word, it is not possible, either Czech or other languages (it is interesting to be just Catalan, which busse translates as a final opponent).
It's simply for a story or game of general importance, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all of the previous and watchful finishes of some level or task.

The pre-war Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While the data in October pointed to a slight drop in assault campaigns, the attacks significantly increased last month with the approaching end of the year.
We recorded a major campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on 18 November.
Attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attack strategies remain the same for now.
The infected Annex in the e-mail has to draw attention to the name it refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month she had a dangerous annex in the name of the word invoice, this time she was marked as Copy to correct the receipts for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal ofset.
Spyware contains functions that scan the Internet browsers and other programs such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex e-mail clients.
The code of damage shall be actively searched for stored login data, which shall subsequently send to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, with the upcoming holidays and the attack population's activity growing again at the end of the year.
In November he remained active and spyware Formbook.
Unlike Agent Tesla, assailants in this case are not specifically focusing on the Czech Republic and security specialists in November, they were rather caught by campaigns with global reach.
Compared with the October data Formbook in November, however, it continues to be slightly weakened, but it remains worth nearly a fifth of all detection.
The attacks continued continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Form was the most common attachment to .exe extension, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account appears further.
The Annex in Czech can then be much more dangerous for Czech users.
A significant decline and abatement of activities is recorded by security analysts in the Fareit program, which cost 1.6 percent of attacks and in the Czech Republic has not been a major attack campaign in recent months.

According to the footage of the waterfront parade and according to my experience, I don't fear an estimated 10,000 people.
The people in the parade filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite coastal communication.
That means a lot of people.
There are about four thousand protestors' parade, which is spontaneously accompanied by an unprecedented number of passers.
I say something new is born here, writes Radek Morký.
That the constant dissatisfaction of several large groups or population groups led to the fact that they had found common language.
Only the anti-vaxers, the anti-roucators, and the co-pol... would not be able to fill or pay such a big parade.
The events of Chczepl dog have an increasing popularity, which reminds me of the Million moment for democracy screws.
Sometimes I feel like they're renting the same stage and technology.
It's hard to say what movement could be paid out of this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the money supply, but also on whether the Pfizer 3-dose vaccine will not become square and more dosed.
It's definitely not leftist or middle movement, so bet it.
The triple vaccine will almost certainly become multidose, because it's obvious that we're going to have to get overoccupied every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists, to whom humanity is a real pride.
End of heel, Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister reporting a change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has committed a new government of Kirila Petkov from the anti-corruption movement to continue the change that won the November elections.
This has already been managed to set up a broad coalition government, which should take place within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has lasted since April when the last government has lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties were unable to reach an agreement to combat bribery and abuse of power, so that they followed two more early elections.
