Parliament has not supported the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the paragraph under the amendment to the Criminal Code on the basis of which the leader of the opposition Julius Tymoshenko was sentenced.
The amendment, which would open the way for the liberation of the prisoner exremity, was rejected by the Members at the second reading of the proposal to mitigate the penalties for economic delinquency.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for the conclusion of allegedly disadvantaged contracts with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not valid, the appeal of the defendant is to be heard by the court in December.
Tymošenková refers to the sentence of political revenge of the regime, suspected of being held captive by the court, caused a trial in the West as well.
The proposal that paragraph 365, based on which the expert was convicted, should be supported in voting by 147 Members.
226 votes were required for his approval.
Libyan Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan Rebélia, has already been defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it, after the war.
The winner remains to be defined.
As it is customary in the region, Islamists will win in the elections, but it is whether moderation or radical.
The national cross-border council has applied to the ordinary law of Sharia and we already have a certain idea about it.
Libya will become a country without criminality, for the theft is the hand.
Women may forget the emancipation, anypostates from faith waiting to be executed and so on.
Instead of being a dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be a order in Libya that we cannot imagine, and which we would certainly not want.
But our way of life isn't even the only, nor objectively best, and it probably wouldn't suit the Libyan people mentioned for a change.
In fact, it is strange that Islamic warriors have taken gratitude from unbelieving dogs.
The only excuse is that from their point of view, there was no NATO general from America, but Alah, whose size during each leading intervention was celebrated.
So when the winners are in Libya, the West does not belong to them.
We took part in shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the person without guaranteeing some profit.
We do not buy militaryly after the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq Libya.
In doing so, the problem with throwing out the crusaders is falling away.
But they'll have oil company without occupation for a pound of Libyan black gold?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast about the indiscriminate protection of human rights.
Unless we can get rid of the Sharia lawmakers.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe have reached investor search.
Statistical spruce over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have published GDP figures for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnantly stagnated, Germany and France are growing.
But today, the debt market is on record.
Investors are no longer looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better off than expected (the increase by 0.3% instead of the original 0,1%), it was stated by France that it appeared in a slight decline by 0.1% (the original figures talked about stagnation).
The Czech economy increased by 1.5 percent this year's third quarter.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated according to the ČSÚ thus confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic performance.
The results are worse than estimates of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy has increased by 1.5 percent this year's third quarter, but has stagnantly stagnated.
The German economy increased by 0.5 percent in the third quarter according to the preliminary and seasonal figures.
The euro area economy and the European Union between July and September against the previous quarter increased by 0.2 percent, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
Reimbursement on her 10-year-old bonds is 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bonds are going to rise to critical limits.
The problems begin to feel Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
Returns to Czech 10-year-old bonds are held under 4%, although the situation in the region is getting worse.
Germany sounds to me that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs have qualified for the EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrate the procedure for 200 million
Football representations the hardest task of the season managed!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful goaltender Petra Jiráčka won 1-0.
Czech football and with a great portion of luck in the second half of time has released a luxurious lead from home rematch and will not be missing again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz was following a progress match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a great portion of luck in the other.
The Czech representation also thanks to home death in the closing, great Czech and hero Jiracek won in Montenegro 1-0 and celebrates the course at the European Championship.
Because of the precise defence of the Czech whole, the Blacksmiths got into pressure in the second half.
The loser of the match became a Damjanovich with a Vulner who burned two great odds.
Moreover, thanks to the great Peter Bohemia, Czech representations will not miss the European Championship next year, and the prize will be paid for approximately 200 million crowns.
There's been a lot of fighting football since the opening minutes.
Both teams were just hard to get involved in a combination, and they were mostly around half-line.
The pressure of the home footballers came in the first half, because the Czech defense strongly repudiated.
Iranian students are prepared to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a live shield.
Several hundred college students created a live shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
By its gesture, they want to express their country's support for the nuclear program before the possible attack of Israel.
On Tuesday, the students prayed before the objects, and then cried out the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Iran created on Tuesday a live shield around the Isphahan nuclear technology center in which uranium is processed.
They thus show that they are prepared to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAAE) stated in its recent report that Iran apparently did not cease to seek nuclear weaponry.
The possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is spoken in Israel.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isphahan nuclear object and then cried out the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed to cripple Iran's nuclear programme as much as possible, Israel's press would also aim at the Natanza facility in which the uranium is enriched.
Cucumbers: not eaten and eaten at dinner
Over a third of children aged 9 to 13 years have overweight problems, with a excess weight of 9 percent of schoolers and a total of 5 percent of children.
Obesityal children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle, as shown by the current survey.
Again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the environment in which it grows and the patterns surrounded by it.
For example, there are only half-a-year-olds on the table in pregnant children, more than half the time they appear in families of children with normal weight.
Fried fries had for dinner the day before the research associated with educational events called Obesity is not a coincidence of more than 19 percent obsess.
Fatty families are also not used to sports, which concerns most of the families of today’s schoolers - only 15 percent of the children have responded that their parents will find time to move on once a week.
Examination between 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last year's school year and was attended by nearly 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the Obesit event is not a coincidence that supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolmen from 4 to 8 were involved in the project.
The correct diet and enough movement in the family are one of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the questions, for example, said that she had five times a day in her breakfast-sniff-sniff-sniff, which is one of the basic assumptions of proper nutrition," said one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and no smoking night
Experts point out that there are important and relative details for healthy development, including regular family breakfast times.
In the Czech Republic, at the same time, only 23 percent of the families of schoolers eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats alone.
And the worst part was finding out that there's no breakfast in the 10th house at all.
Breakfast is the basis for the proper daily diet.
Questionnaire has shown that children in the families of obsessive children are more often consumed by unhealthy fries.
Almost every - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
He regularly sportss more than 40 percent of the children asked, but their parents had less than half - 15 percent.
Set up your menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to gather their own diets according to their own taste and own opinion.
"The management preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years are far from healthy nutrition to ideal."
Among their favorite food is a lot of flour, meaty and sweet dishes.
"Alarming is especially a large popularity of sweet lemonades," states the final report on research.
For lunch, the main meal was won by pasta just above the poultry.
However, children practically didn't want lupines at all, and they were also low on fish and vegetable dishes.
Reluctance to Health
The research also showed that children are willing to adjust their dietary habits if they get the right information.
"For the survey participants' control group, who completed the questionnaire after the end of the Obesit lecture, there is no chance, in a number of cases, a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," states the results of the project.
For example, it was a marketing for sweet lemonade, where more children would start giving preference to ordinary water.
Children also more frequently included in the questionnaire for poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and would reduce sweet meals and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, claiming pros.
In the opening article on how stylists learn, I had such a bit of a complaints that it had been a lot at the opening hours.
I had no idea what would follow.
Lectures of three professors in the field, clothing of problematic characters, and seminars on how it goes on the square.
And it's gonna be worse.
The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "smacked".
This time, Director Alice and I discussed (the course is not the only boy) how to dress a woman who doesn't have a perfectly proportionate figure.
And such is the vast majority.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's a boy's figure with no real curves, and someone's overweight again.
The stylist must know how to optically remove wide shoulders, extend his neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We got tips as to how Jennifer Lopez's women, both bigger tits and hips, and a narrow belt, stressed the character and at the same time not to dress too challengingly.
If, for example, there is a difference between the belt and the sides such that the skirt or pants really do not fit, then one such piece should be paid to be sewn up at least.
You won't regret it, because perfectly falling clothing is priceless.
In a peaceful dress you will feel much better than in one that keeps moving around you, winning, leaving in the waist and the like.
A boy figure can afford to wear algae, applications, heights or reels.
Of course, such information and character types are a lot of characters, so I'm glad I've had all week to get all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that because of the homework you've given you, it's all the same.
Each of them received a assigned celebrity to come up with two outfits: daily and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the given personality and the type of character.
I'll be "dressing" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the spirit of brightness, for me personally definitely better than such Britney Spears, Christina Aguiler, who has recently gained about 100 kilos (please take a question about the hill), or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut out of magazines or search the Internet and print and work graphicly afterwards.
Moodboard, as the whole result says, will also express our personal style and relationship to graphic performance.
Think about the graphic page of styling is important too.
Thestyleist does not only physically dress, but also creates, for example, the so-called product pages in magazines (in specific terms, such as trends of purses, coats, etc.).
That's what stylist and designer Mario Kamenník told us about.
But it's not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general view
Saturday's lecture, loaded with information about characters types, just three guests from the field.
Stylish Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
James reminded us that fashion is illusion and the stylist should be able to use it.
And a smart stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is key in this case.
For example, such a twig (or if you originally want trenchcoat) can be worn classic over jeans and shirt as a coat, but you can dress it on a bare body, shoes of boats and shoot like a dress.
Or you just need to get your sleeves or the collar and the whole look of the look looks different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can start breaking them," James said.
Finally, I am aware of why we are mocking all the lessons that we combine to do, why, when we can see something else in fashion magazines as well.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that the stylist needs to be prepared for a lot more options of clothing than he can take pictures of them.
So at the fashion story, which will have ten pages (then ten outfits), I have to be ready to "stop" at least 15.
And also that in the picture of clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces, sometimes completely different than in reality.
So we have to count on that in the production of the outfit.
That the image and style of the game, once more than half of the success, has been confirmed by Honza Pokorný.
Just look at Madonna, who's not exactly a miracle singer, but the image and marketing made her a world-class old.
In the Czech Republic, access to the use of stylists is rather cold.
Even the familiar faces of him sometimes consider him useless (it is sufficient that I know something, as I look at it, it is secondary).
And if someone has already let us create styling, then we're supposed to count on the fact that with a great probability, he's giving us a whole different (lighter) size than he really does.
Then it is left to Google and see if the boulevard wrote about the celebrity and the others.
Both Honza and Mario on Sunday put on our hearts that stylists were not enough to understand in fashion and be able to decompose the outfit.
In her work, she communicates primarily with people who dress up, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to estimate people, not to be encouraged, to stand by for their opinion.
"If you're ordered by a manager to talk to her about the wardrobe and fill her up with nice pieces, you can't throw out the whole closet and tell her, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things you praise and recommend what to wear," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what must contain all of the so-called "flux" or a bag to the square.
It's the one you turn on around your waist and you have all the necessary proselets.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, hair rollers or closing pins, there are also siron thread (with it, the stylist is helping to draw products such as purses or hats), special clips that we turn on behind the clothing if there is bigger (sniff or other clamps are not permissible, they would destroy clothes) or sewing.
To not just listen, but also practically try something out, we learned how to fit our shoes right.
Even when taking pictures at the studio, where the flat surface is, the irritation could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch shoes with our feet so they don't get hurt by accident.
So there is a need for real skill.
Mario pleased me when my creation without a win.
Because he's not really my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard on our second weekend course continuation.
It's getting more and more clear to me that giving up styling at a professional level really isn't walking through a pink set, no matter what anyone wants.
In Need for Speed: The Run races across America.
Reviews
Originally carefree rides due to a series of completely unnecessary lajadhaic errors turn into a routine morning course.
Although the Ambition has largely succeeded, it is not valid when no one obviously wanted to do anything else.
A new part with the subtitle The Run built before the release of high expectations.
He promised that the summer racing series Need for Speed would once again move a bit in a new direction and from playable demonstrations appeared as a game that in the action race genre would not have to be only to the number.
We were also curious about how the passages will impact, in which the main hero will get out of the car and run through his own way.
But as with the NFS series is customary, many are a little different than we thought.
They are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole is dragged down several unnecessary errors that appear in the series for more or less years.
So it's actually not even a mistake, but a demonstration of some sort of incomprehensible flexicurity of developers.
Adventure starts very well.
You are listed in a story whose main hero Jack has some problems of personal character and as a solution it is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You will sit on the west coast in San Francisco, and your task is to arrive first to New York.
The idea carries several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't even have a moment of feeling that the game would still offer the same thing.
Some of the environments are also very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's not a world-renowned thing.
But driving across the desert, autumn landscape or high in snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, competitions are screened from time to time by some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you put yourself in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to be put to sleep by an avalanche.
In addition, individual races are well-arranged.
There are only a few types of them, but that's enough.
For a while you're trying to outrun the desired number of opponents (mainly a classic race), then you're back on time (classical fighting with feet) and then you're waiting for a duel with a single opponent.
The police will be involved from time to time, and this will make your efforts even more difficult.
There's new passages out of the car.
Rather, it's just an interactive animation where Jack usually flees from someone and you have to help him in that way by printing correct buttons at the right times.
Nothing complicated.
It surprises, however, that these passages are much less in the game than you would expect (even if only three).
As a result, this is to the benefit of the matter, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying and in the context of the above mentioned one is so lined up with elements that describe the game.
The ride model goes in the footsteps of previous parts.
This means that it is no longer a person's fault today, but it can't be said to be a negative.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the more attractive racing of the bus model here is still quite good, although we would be able to find better in the competition.
So when all sweats are in perfect order.
Problems start to appear after a while.
Unlike the model, the collision model isn't very well.
From the game of this type we don't expect to count complex deformations and collisions, but if practically before any impact on any object you have no idea how your car's gonna behave, then I guess everything isn't all right.
Typically, when driving or passing cars in normal operation, you sometimes only slightly lick each other, but sometimes in almost identical situations your car will end in wild pirouettes.
Or even a robbery.
I mean, thanks to the restart system, it doesn't bother you at all, but it's gonna tear you apart in a reliable way.
The restarts are handled so that if you smash or go far off the track, the game will throw you back on the last catch point on the track.
However, only five are available in each race.
Once you've exhausted them, you have to start the race again.
So it's more of a tool in case something doesn't work out than you could rely on them specifically.
Sometimes even restarts will not help, it will solve them until the need to learn from the race section.
The great jade of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be carried out in a specific way, otherwise you simply don't fit in.
Otherwise you will meet at the given place "civil" cars always in the same configuration whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds sooner or one minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations where you see the opponent’s opponent’s two counter-driving cars run easily before you, while when you get there, they’re already in a position to roam them or lose them.
It doesn't matter when you get to them, because it's calculated so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors also have another advantage.
In all the time, you will find a few places where you, no matter where you are, always pass the same opponent at the same place.
It's best hit at the end of the game on a long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
The opponent must be able to get in front of you, apparently, at any cost.
If you're going ahead, you're going to get a lot worse than an anti-driving vehicle, so you're going to be going a little bit out there at first.
It is possible to understand the intention to make the game more tense and more adrenalal, but the execution is so obvious that it will effectively leave you behind.
And it's a shame, because despite a simple driving model, it's fun to play, and places to do so that sometimes you don't literally pretend to watch where they fly.
And it doesn't really matter whether he's got the credit for a concept of 50 unique lines, putting up races so that no boredom doesn't have a chance, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the car exchange during races.
You have to pay attention to gas pumps on the road, because you can change your car right there, even though in most cases you can cope with what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Corporates are suitable for urban areas, strong American breamers on equal highways and exotic supervoltages on technical riding, for example, by clicking mountain roads.
The main story mode goes hand in hand and mode of challenges, which are races in each place you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points into your profile, which is common to challenges and stories.
Different items are removed for obtaining higher driver level: starting cars and ends with backgrounds for profile.
It is also again connected to the online feature Autolog, which, inter alia, compares your results with other players and provides additional community functions.
One other difficult to understand is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you will reach the metro tunnel (be it), where you will marry it in the dark after the tracks (be it).
On the tachometer, you get the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (beyond) and the subway set comes down from that, and you get uncompromised.
In the editor's office, it's about a few more days we're gonna have a discussion about whether nobody really thought about the game or whether the authors are really that big of a fool.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and in several cases even great.
It freezes down so that at some more challenging moments, images fall down pretty tragically in some cases.
However, this is especially due to storms with a larger number of participants, when you would not have seen a smooth picture as much as possible.
Sound page is fine and soundtrack is a question of taste.
In an attempt to enjoy the widest possible range of rather younger audiences, the soundtrack came from the category "every dog other villages", but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, someone might not buy the game.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so much distracted.
If the game avoids completely unnecessary errors, then we wouldn't be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of NFS in the past few years.
But this is the way the game works in vain.
I'm sure fun is fine, but get ready for your mistakes to hit you in the eye with a force of lethargy reflectors.

Ambassador to EU Vicen:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly disrupted the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five, six years to calm down, calm down, and before all players get used to their new roles," she began her lecture at the Faculty of Law, Czech Ambassador to the European Union, Milena Vicen.
As much as her motto "Complicately and openly about Europe" takes seriously, she has already shown in the first part of the lecture, when she has managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that a number of students from the Faculty of Law of the UK would envy her.
Vicen also endorsed the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first there was criticism that it was inconclusive that he was a grey official, that he could not do any part, and I must say that everyone was able to breathe, that the role was excellent."
"It is a person who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, to communicate well with them and has a clear vision where the European Union should go."
The new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy explained as an answer to the question: "Who is this European Union? Which phone number should I call?", i.e. a significant step towards unification and greater clarity of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our shit.
Vicen also dealt with the agenda that the European Council has lived and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency pointed out to be a success.
The Czechs addressed the emerging financial crisis, solved the gas crisis, or arranged a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
At this time, the government declared a negative negative for the Czech Republic to be very badly damaged.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, the "fakt frmol" was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that has been resolved today.
Moreover, the new seven-year budget of the Union must still be approved, which is why the current economic situation is considerably complicated.
Whether the budget will be slim and cost-effective, which sectors will be given the preference to which countries will be supported more and less, all this is on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which it came to Brussels: "About Europe understandably".
"I really don't like ugly shorts, foreign words, a shamemaker that no one understands.
How does a citizen understand that he does not really think of curved or round cucumbers, bananas, or that we really need to be banned from the raw materials."
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
Multispeed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czech Republic has the reputation of Eurosceptics and people who notice rather the negative side of things.
Moreover, it is sorry for the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
She believes there are many factors, such as modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivating letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"You tell me that when Polak and Hungarian come to me and the Slovak comes, the French one next to me will say, "Hey, what are you seeing there, what are you doing, your Visegrad Four?"
In the future, according to Vicen, new strict rules are waiting for Member States' budgetary policies.
As a very real then, the concept of a two-speed, if not a multispeed Europe, rather than a new 'European Federation'.
"We have euro area countries and countries outside the euro area."
"We have Schengen space, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
"First, it was said to cooperate only with the countries that they wanted and those who did not want to stand up."
"There will be more institutes, and it will be a strongly two-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle that all the topics that have an impact on the whole of the Union should be discussed between all Member States, not only among the euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM’s Second Century Started
If someone were looking for the word most accurate for IBM's strategy, it would probably be as close as possible to "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it has been seen as a very contemporary company, and yet a hundred years have passed since its establishment.
The foundation of this long-termity was laid by the first head of the company, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already hit the password that many world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His password "Think!" became a print around which the life of the future giant (and also the name of an internal magazine that began in IBM in 1935).
It was also the basis of Watson carefully constructed corporate culture.
"For us from IBM means long-term thinking of continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her basic values and was not afraid of changing everything else around her.
This allowed us during our first centuries to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second hundred we can achieve even more," said Samuel J. Palmisano, current director of the company.
Processed system
Watson, in the 1930 ’ s, took care of his employee, like Bťa’s businessman in the Czech Republic, as one of the first American employees, had a paid leave, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and an elaborate system for rewarding the best inventors and traders.
Similarly, IBM has a relationship with the customer in the long term.
The company has been brilliant at making talent since the beginning - as one of the world's first companies, it has cancelled any discrimination, so it can choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisan headed by IBM next year will wipe out a woman named Virginia Rometta.
The one in IBM has been working for thirty years, and has now become the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called jams in recent years, online landstormings, many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder ideas are enough - almost half a million people in the company.
An institution with a good name
The firm provides a strong internal and external image.
"Since the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology company," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of the book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with the use of technology," said George Colony of the Forrester Research consulting company.
As the company says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as she is familiar with her logo in the United States - has grown to one of the world's largest companies in a hundred years.
It is probably the most exclusive technology company - develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnologies.
They hold the most patents from all American technology companies, and five of its employees won Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include the ATM, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the disk.
IBM has become the second largest technology company according to market capitalization (the first is Apple) since 1996, when Microsoft has already preceded it.
View forwards
Not all products and innovations have gone into customer taste and time - IBM has, for example, not made a bet on its own OS/2 operating system, on-line services Prodigy or IBM PCjr.
"If your business is built on the move ahead, you cannot emotionally apply to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
This is why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they do not work, then leave them.
Unlike competitive Microsoft, which essentially stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
IBM's largest share of the service in the market, after about five, is software and hardware.
At the same time, in 1990, he was with more than half a share of the strongest representatives of hardware.
Since 2000 IBM sold little profitable assets worth $115 billion, and over the same period it invested $58 billion in purchasing prospective technologies.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the new financial crisis has been overrun by the world for the first time.
IBM is acting according to the reference of its first boss Thomas J Watson, who has also increased the volume of investment during the major economic crisis.
To date, IBM appears to have been undermining the current crisis.
IBM's stock price has increased by 120 percent since early 2008, and the firm's net profit continues to increase continuously.
IBM's corporate password is to change everything, just its values.
It can therefore be expected that even when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant can handle it.
IBM History: From cheesedoers to the universe
IBM (International Business Machines) was established in New York City a hundred years ago, originally had a complex name for Compuating Tabulating Recording Corporation.
IBM took over until 1924 - originally it was a brand used for branch offices in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later IBM gave a merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They owned technologies such as famous "powders," i.e. hours recording employees coming and leaving.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the corporate supervisory board by 1930.
Flint hired the head of a competitive company named Thomas J Watson to help him manage the company.
The leader then criticized IBM’s founders - on Watson’s ideas, an invincible corporate culture and identity are still being built.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as her name suggests, started with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business - from carves of meat and cheese to checkout.
During the first four years, as Watson was running the company, he doubled his turnover to nine million dollars and began a vast expansion of the company into all the worlds.
Watson was so impeccable to the company that almost 40 years later, in the boss’s chair, his son, Thomas Watson Junior, cut him out.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s people and computers from IBM helped NASA to fly to space - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first family of computers in 1964 - a number of IBM System/360.
The classic "cylinder" that established the computer standard of that time, entitled IBM 5150, came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its Chinese computers to Lenovo, on the other hand, purchased a consultant section of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to provide advice and high value added services.
The strategy that has been paying off in the last three years of IBM - is the concept of Smarter Planet, "the smarter planets".
Its aim is to make smart use of technologies in areas which have not yet been planned and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or city management.
For the trade area, IBM recently introduced a "Smarter Commercial" platform which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country as well.
She founded her branch in the then Czechoslovakia in 1932, as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, apart from IBM ČR, there is also a centre for strategic outsourcing in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe are located in Prague, and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
A psychiatrist of a unfaithful husband:
Iveta, leave that donkey alone, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtář (53) said end!
After his husband Joseph Rychttar (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartoš (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph of the pink dream would wake up and come home.
But now she's waiting, and she's made clear rules for another life.
"Pepa can go home, but not as my partner," explained Rychtář.
When Darina Rychtář provided Bartoš's asylum in her home in summer, she probably didn't even seem to know how her marriage would end.
Even though Iveta had moved from Říčan 30 days after her insistence, Pepa did not leave her singer.
He even publicly admitted he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, made her husband’s relationship adjourned, and now she even gave him a goodbye forever.
He doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If Rychtář and Bartoš broke up once, his wife's open arms won't wait at home.
"He's my son's biological father, and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will drive him out."
"But he will live it not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Rychtář said, "the fact that she had separated herself from her husband and only insists on mutual justice.
Joseph's closing down Darina's back door, so far, I'm fine.
"I respect the wife's decision."
"Iveta will be with Iveta and I won't change it."
"The husband made a paper marriage, and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I care about repairs, gardens, real estate, shopping."
"We're having a very normal conversation with Darina, except we don't share the bed," said the Flash Rychtář.
If Rychtář had found a new love too, she wouldn't be able to defend her.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he's going with, and if he has a friend.
I know this is my fault, I have fallen in love with Iveta, and I take all my responsibility," Joseph said.
The worst women's habites, do they concern you?
If you ask men if they can name any typical female abuses, they usually all fall out of their sleeve in one.
Dear women, do you find yourself in the following lines, where are several female evildoers that can perfectly dissipate the blood in the veins to men?
Shopping
Does your second half count that you're addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like shopping and shopping in mass discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a habit.
Some women realize that they should at least cut their shopping passion a little.
But tell me, which would resist just walking around the clothes stores, looking for well-falling surfaces and then all of them (now in different color designs) to try in the cabin?
Although it's for most women to buy a hobby, men can literally be done in hell.
Just remember how many times you've told yours so he'd rather wait for you before the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"Do I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start practicing?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Don't these sentences remind you of anything?
Isn't it?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop caring about yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
Stronger sex matches also the fact that the frequency of this complaining increases, the more women are more annoying.
Order and purity in the first place
It's like an endless carousel.
Washes windows, sucklings, wipe tiles, wipe dust, crushing tub - at least twice a week.
Do you tell your partner that he put his dirty foot on a clean tile, children, that they soiled the washed-out washbasin and covered the glassy living wall, with which you gave so much work?
If you are suffering from this very "convulsions", try to realize that nothing is meant to be outnumbered and order and purity should definitely not stand within the family in the first place.
This harmless desire for purity can endanger your relations and family well-being.
Stripping
"You used twirls throw in the trash."
"You're gonna wear those old socks tomorrow too?"
"The wet wipe doesn't belong to the ground."
If you've been to your partner this way several times a day, know that you can make sure of him.
Of course, you don't mean anything wrong, you want everything to be okay.
Maybe if the men knew that, the women wouldn't have to go up there so much...
Talk, gossip
For some women there are also rumors, gossips, and also insults, and coercion against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, and so they like to go through things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps every one of us is gonna let some small harmless gossip or glue go out there.
Hands on your heart, it's your own hope for all women.
Again, however, are the best grains which like and often gossip, perhaps everyone despises and are particularly dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the female workforce.
Jágr and Voráček helped assist in the victory of Philadelphia
The hockey assailant Jaromír Jgr participated in a Monday NHL game with two assists in the Philadelphia 5:3 victory on the Carolin ice and is again at the head of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
From the overview of the nine-year-old star, Claude Giroux, who added one more match and was declared the best player of the game.
Two assists in the match were recorded by Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček.
After a game of overseas journalists, he claimed that Giroux had predicted a big evening.
"I told him before the game, he'd give it to Hattrick."
"I felt it."
"It's time for you to experience this feeling," explained Jágr, after which Giroux goal from the first Flyer missile.
A few moments later, the team had a second hit with Czech feet.
Voreček fought for Hurricanes' brand and presented it among the leather circles of Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first intermission, Patrick Dwyer reduced his introduction to the weakening home-player, but Flyers once again owned the introduction.
In particular, Giroux.
After working with Jágr, he scored the third goal, then retaliated his shooting to the fourth goal of Wayne Simmons.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but he certainly belongs to the best three," awarded the Jgr of his center.
"I never thought at the end of my career I'd play with a hockey player like him."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to play at him."
"All those years in the NHL my teammates tried to play at me, now it turns out," Jagger added.
Carolina still made drama from the game, the goal of Tuom Ruutu, and again Dwyer, who settled out of the crime shooting, got different from one goal.
Another complications, however, did not allow Matt Read, who ended the numbering of two to one.
"He hit a great deal in our Pronger zone."
"He pushed a disc, I took a speed and (Read) drove to a more distant rod."
"I tried to hit him, and I'm glad it worked out," said the last goal of the match from his point of view, Voráček.
Philadelphia won the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček failed the game against Buffy, in the second third he resigned due to injuries in the upper body.
Candiens lost two lines in addition to an experienced barrel and lost a penalty shot of 2:3.
One of their raids didn't turn Tomáš Plecanec.
A home coach rather than lost points was mutilated by an extensive midline native, with only five defenders winning the match.
"It's bad."
"Watching was just one experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"The class of changing did it to us, and we couldn't resist."
"We were supposed to simplify the game, move the knock from our zone."
We had gaps in that," added one of P.K. Subban's defenders.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 interventions Winnipeg to win 5:2 over Tampa Bay.
The goals of Jets, who interrupted the five-band series of prothers, were divided by five different shooters.
As the tour prices developed since 1989
By 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in the then Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sportourist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in a vast majority only tours to the countries of the socialist block, as traveling west was very limited.
The Czech tourists traveled to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sovie in Crimea near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, then the Yugoslav regime bowed to the West and the journeys of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were then very limited.
The great paradox in the time of socialism was that it was not possible for citizens of the socialist block (i.e. Czechs too) to travel individually in socialist countries.
If the Czech citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed a copy from this country, otherwise there was no individual trip possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand up the front overnight with a sleeping bag or to have "good friends" in the travel agency.
However, it has not been won.
The so-called foreign trade promise, which was a condition for a trip to the West, was not awarded to 'politically unreliable people' who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign commitment it was not possible to obtain funds (outland currency) to travel to the West.
However, the Czechs have spent much of their holidays in the country, resulting in a large number of cottages and cottages which the Czechs have purchased and this habit still survives.
Traveling the Czechs has been such a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 she was our maximum vacation in the NDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czech Republic spent 4.5 million permitted in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are not aware of today is that it was not possible for us to travel freely until 1989, as it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
The 90s of last century’ visa waiver happened to neighbouring Western European countries, starting with a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria’s Vienna and Germany.
The Czechs have long been unable to enjoy trips to the West, so everyone wanted to see for a while.
For example, in Paris, Czechs spent their trips in parks in tents, because our incomes did not allow us to pay for the hotel or guest house.
A typical feature of Czech travel was that at this time we were driving our own food, cans, salamis, etc. to save ourselves.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely exchangeable Czech crown, allowing our tourists to purchase the Western currency freely after many rains.
But our living standards and average salaries rose, which resulted in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began regularly since 1997 to prepare tours with charter air connections, making air trips incredibly reduced due to the ability to make quantitative discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free relations to virtually every developed country in the world, except the US, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred right in 2000, when the first direct charter flight to exotic history was reported in Thailand thanks to the considerable demand from the Czech Republic.
Since this year so each year they fly with Czech tourists direct charters to warm remote countries, this winter will be flying directly from the Czech Republic until the twelfth exotic destinations.
The exotic countries today will visit around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States repealed the visa for Czech tourists, and this definitely included our countries among the most advanced countries of the world.
In 2008, also the Czechs spent more than half of their abroad leavers (50.3%) for the first time in the history of one foreign holiday including the cost of their stay more than 15 thousand CZK per person.
The general meeting is to find the chairman, once again, but there is a threat of path.
Almost five months is Czech football without the chair and threatens to be attended by Ivan Haška's successor to the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR) will not be known for another extraordinary general meeting that takes place on Thursday in Nymburka.
There is still no deal, according to what election order it will take.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest in running Czech football is Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June and asked his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the era after Hašk, football has slipped back to the places between the two Union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16th, when the new President was to be selected.
The delegates of the general meeting took place at the National House in Prague in Smíchov, which was unnecessary because the meeting was blocked and it was not just a way of election.
In fact, there has been no agreement, who has the right to vote in the assembly - whether only the statutory representatives, or also the officers with full powers.
At this single point, there has been a partial consensus since then, which also helped the recommendations of the Constitution for State and the law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
However, disputes are still in control of the election order.
Even the executive committee, which is already in its dealings, has not done anything else, has brought too clearly into the situation.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is, how do we proceed in the third round to rule out the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to follow the opinions or find another model," said one of the three F ČR Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
According to the findings of the proposed model in the third round, the winner of the candidate will have greater percentage of support in the chamber behind which he can run.
Morava is allegedly willing to go to concessions to win a candidate who will get a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech party enforces the condition that the winner must gain at least a two-thirds extreme in this percentage census.
"However, this would put out the meaning of two previous rounds, that would completely deny a two-chamber concept," explains the opposition of the Moravian side of the Freedom, according to which it would be best not to bend and vote according to the conditions in force.
Thomas Paclík agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the terms of the proposed electoral order are best met by all candidates for Pelt.
"I wish it to be chosen as set out."
"To avoid any major nonsense as at the last General Meeting," said Victoria Plzeň, who ran for the first time and mentioned himself against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburka, according to him, the new chairman will be known and believe that the candidates together will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All passion will calm the possible progress of the national team to the European Championships today."
"Fitbal will again be on a happy wave, there will be greater willingness to cooperate," thinks the Applelonian activist, who has three of the greatest experience in managing football both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more persistent.
"I hope for the deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divided."
"It is not among Czech and Moravia people, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations on purpose."
"This may cause the blockage of the general meeting to come again."
"But I hope that common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There's not much time left to agree on all sides.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality would be complete at all in the match.
The Air Special, in which they were to travel to Podgorice, among other things, the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, did not leave Prague because of the technical breach in the morning, looking for a replacement option, as part of the executive committee to the scene of the barrier retaliation.
In the end, there may be a decisive meeting at the ministerial level, which may be reportedly held on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to make a divided party within the strongest sport association in the country to agree.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, credibility of football and also a prepared general meeting of ČSTV, which will solve the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Saza.
Package goes to the fight for the President because they don't see the right candidate
If Plzně Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), nor would he have signed up for a top function.
"If quality adept existed, I'm fighting for him, and I'm not going to the election."
"But in the current situation, no one has been able to find it," said ČTK Paclík.
To compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchlo, Paclík’s motivation is to try to stop Pelt’s alleged favourite election on his way to Fáčr’s forehead.
Paclík also points out that, in the event of his victory, the chair would only hold out until 2013, when a proper general meeting is on the agenda.
In his post, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not too involved with football events.
"With some people who might have thought of it, I spoke."
"For me, it was crazy when some people said that at this point they didn't want to identify themselves with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that view," he said.
Paclík said now that he most upset Peltovo with President of the Plzeň Regional Football Union Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation known as a powerful lobbyist, has the ability to influence the voting of delegates at the General Assembly.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík to stand in the presidency position.
"If he had won, the current state of the game is now conjured, and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"In combination with Berbra's support, which is a successful merchant, the football wouldn't do much better," said Paclík.
It also suggests that Peltov’s name was mentioned years ago in a response to the investigation of the corruption affair, from which Pelta went out without punishment.
"I don't know what kind of prestige Pelt's football would have won."
"And what would we also look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who also takes the view of his local statement that he would "sold the Plzeň club if Pelta became Chairman".
In the event that Paclík had triumphed on Thursday's election, he would have been able to imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another Rajchl candidate, who was encouraged by Paclík, is also considering the idea of the next Rajchl candidate, who was supported by the Packel in front of the radiant war mass that ended with his fist.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I would go to."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him as the head of representation."
"But he couldn't manage the association."
"I don't stick my nose where I don't know it," said Paclík, who in September gave a lot of attention to standing behind the appeal of a panel of referees led by Ludek Macelou, whose replacement was Dagmar Damková.
Paclík says he'd be in charge of the Troulf Association.
He refers to his ability from the management of private companies, since last summer he has also been in charge of Pilsen, which with his support in May celebrated the prime minister's league triumph.
"I have the strength to change something in the football environment to contribute to his particular cultivation."
"To reduce the influences of some interest groups, which may tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal commission, which goes into a disgusting situation," said Paclík, who does not cover his antipathy, for example, to the Spartan boss Daniel Křetín.
One priority would also consider strengthening FAČR's relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby for more money from lottery taxes on political leaders.
"It is one of the key things a new chairman should do."
"If gambling is taxed as political parties declare, I understand their argument, but on the contrary they must say where the money is going," he noted.
As a burden now, Paclík does not take his link with the Plzeň club, even though he himself claims that the chairman of the FAČR should be "overpage".
Pelta is again connected to Jablonce, Rajchl with Prague Duklou.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't even see the point in putting my stock into a palate at a plenary club and returning in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised a new FáčR post that would rule out the electoral heel.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that in the case of the election of the principle, the FAČR had new positions, which would definitely rule out disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonian functionist is an optimist before Thursday's meeting in Nymburka and believes that the electoral struggle will significantly dampen the possible success of football representations today.
Pelta promised before the September unrealized election that he was going to focus on representation and fundraising.
He decided to go to the final moment before the last general meeting, and so he could use his two-month delay to defend his idea of driving football and introduce himself in a wider context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect me to know the chairman on Thursday."
"They feel it is high time for an association to lead," says a man who is primarily associated with the apple club, but who has worked in Sparta for many years and the Executive Committee of the Union.
That is why he believes he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He is convinced that the current problem with choice is euphoria, which prevailed at the time of Ivan Hask's reign.
"The gods at the June General Assembly were approved statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If various interpretations were not allowed, we had had the President since September," pointed out Pelta.
Just reworking the most important civil society document he treated as a war of delegates.
"If I become President, I will take this as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a fundamental thing that we can't be without," says Pelta.
He said he's always trying not to define himself against his opponents.
He had previously noted that he could imagine working with Jindrich Rajchl, whom he recognized due to his legal education, and he knows well that his anti-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He did not turn to Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who, on the contrary, left him dry.
"In football is moving for over a year, he has already gained some successes."
"But his attacks were unworthy, and a lot of people ended up in the way of election campaigns."
"Therefore, many of them now doubt his true character," said Pelta, at the opponent's address, who said he remained faithful to the curses he had announced in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the representation.
It should be an interpretative box of football.
"And I would also try to end all the affair with the bail of the Bohemians or the titles of last year's corruption scandal."
"Now, I'd rather go to meetings with both the private and the state sector to provide enough money for all football," said ČTK six-four-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time, he promised that his coming to the forehead of football would not mean any personnel clean-up.
"I would first have to get to know the fullness of individual employees," he pointed out Strahov, where long-term insufficiency is understandable.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the fight against war, they believe that on Thursday they will not have delegates in vain to Nymburk.
"If it is the only point at issue that will be voted in the third round, we can still move."
"The football needs credibility, and it only gets by having its leader finally," Pelta is left two days before maybe the decisive day of his optimist career.
Rajchl promises to work hard under him
If the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic was elected to the fourth general meeting to the present Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his election he will begin to work hard.
He wants to enforce system changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for the individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the bail of the Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money to football and to continue the work initiated by previous President Ivan Hasek.
"As chairman, I'd like to devote to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football after youth."
"But I'm not saying that I would do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview for the Czech Republic.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the competences in the executive committee so that each member is devoted to a specific area."
"And I'll give out hard tasks to move on every one of these segments by a mile' step forward."
"A lot of people would probably not be happy about this, because it would start to work really hard and not just criticize the work of others," he added.
He said he thought he wasn't running again because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people who will keep throwing down my feet and questioning my every step," he explained why he hesitated.
"A lot of people told me I couldn't give up, because then others would give up."
"This is a trust that I cannot just throw away," he said.
He is also moved by the continuation of the work that he started with Haskeh.
"In the past two years, a lot of work has been done, and I don't want to throw it away."
"There are processes that will have been launched for a few years, and I would hate for someone to stop them," he said, "in the event of the election of another candidate Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the union might be restored to a time before Haskek.
"I believe in integrity, and that's the thing I think Mirek Pelta doesn't know."
"There are mostly people behind him who would do football just so that he'd be chosen."
"A lot of things can be read to me, but it's definitely not that I'm taking sides."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to play football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just those chosen," Rajchl meant.
He also vomits the claim that he would be just a Czech chairman.
"Even though some people try to say otherwise, I plan to make for Moravia the maximum."
"For example, it is time to think about the second league being divided into the Czech and Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would not be such a current situation when there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since the Chief of the Plzeň Club Tomáš Paclík has also been involved in fighting for the President, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its Vice-President and sees that there are clear successes behind me," Rajchl said, who considers it his success to be investigating tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating lottery law.
On the contrary, he thinks that the union does not pull one rope.
While he claims that Pelt is "disqualified to return confidence to Czech football", the second of Paclík’s competitors considers that he is a strong candidate who has a football to offer.
"Nobody can question that he's done a great job in Pilsen this year."
"If he was elected, perhaps he would continue to do the things Ivan Hasek started here and would not significantly alter the staff cast in the committees."
"He would not want to twist it to his benefit," appreciates the rivals Rajchl.
Europe's most beautiful swimming pools
Jump to blue
Julia Stanek
The brochure from the sight of Uphona, the fancy swimming pool in Budapest: Who travels Europe can experience his blue wonder - and after the tour of cities or travel let his tired legs rest in thermal baths.
The book will show where the wellness at the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder was released in the past one and a half years on the discovery journey, she could not miss her luggage: her swimwear.
Lying on water, looking up to height to artistically shaped doves, she swam across the marble passti (a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her on the edge of the pool and admired carefully restored Art Nouveau sailing.
If she liked some harvesting, she was brought to her notebook in the bridge - even with remarkable details about the way the building was built and history of the building.
More than 200 plováren examined in this way the historian of the Meder architecture and present them in their published book "Badefreuden (Badost out of swimming)" "The People's regiments in Munich, the historical palace of the ploren in Schwarzwald,"The strict core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "Cesta for the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Bohemia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old Germany is a real entuzasist of the sailing culture.
With sports, it doesn't work too much, says Meder - only in the water is something else.
The only thing about anger is that fan swimming has to be satisfied with blue ducks and seaweeds, while health runners can breathe in the dark scent of spruce forests or listen to the happy snorkeling of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why fins must always be so ugly," says Mrs. Meder in Vienna.
"So I began to collect nice sailboats."
Water level doubles architecture
Flavouring in the ski pool and essential oils for sauna - the factor of comfort is therefore so big that it concerns all senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the foundings tried, they could be full of real traps for the eyes: "The town of the floor has a man in the water level of the spa."
"But it's transparent, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: high vault, varied tiles, jumping board.
The Maloforme portrait of "Badefreuden" provides at 190 pages everything that needs to be known about architectural and cultural history of historical oase wellnes - it encourages but above all the desire to jump into the blue.
The sighted specimens discovered the collector of Mrs. Meder's sailboat while her search in Hungary.
In addition to the wonderful spas such as 100 years old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, she found water with nitrates in the original karst cave (the cave spa in Miskonc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose swimming pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in the building of the shape of a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberena).
On the other hand, they offer many heated sailboats under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria. As far as a person has a curish earthquake in the eyes of the whole city, he can look at the snow covered by Arlberg in the outdoor swimming pool - and: In steam bath there is a window from which one can watch traffic on ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design of the swimming pool expects spa guests in Längenfeld: Akvapark Ötztal looks like a ufo that just landed in the Alps.
From the three tops of the open men in the winter, a couple are rising while in the background of the Mount Ötztala to heaven.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not every floating pool collector Mrs. Meder pach cholór grew up in a flu.
Many thermal baths are smelled in the air, in the Arpád in Hungarian Békescsabad, it smells like hot oil to the extent that one can barely believe that he got into the healing baths.
The smell comes from a healing water containing alkaline bicarbonate, which is almost black and whose sediments elevate on the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was disappointed in its search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luhačovice, she hit a closed terrain.
In 1902 the architect Dušan Jurkovič designed the bath was closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder saw the falling window of red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the weed growing heavily between the tiles.
On the other hand, they stood in a magic floating pool in Schwarzwald: at the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas are already three stages of construction; one can discover not only the neo-Romanian elements that come from the time of its formation in 1844, but also the Maurium in Alhambra style, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation of 1995, Palais Thermal has been a popular spa spot for Mrs. Iris Meder swimming pools, not only because Schwarzwald comes from.
"It's already a performance to combine so diverse building styles into such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
At such a palace there's probably a marginal thing to dive in the thermal pool.
Aggressive speculation
Deutsche Bank examines commodity trade
Christian Teevs
Leaves Deutsche Bank his trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to information, SPIEGEL-ONLINE commissioned Josef Ackermann to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the head of the company wants to produce consequences.
Hamburg -
It is clear to the Federal citizens: 84% of the German people, according to one study, consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of the questions even require Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to emerge from this trade because the world’s poorest problems are deepened.
This is the result of Fors' survey under the mandate of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study was based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
It shows the author of Harald Schumann that the stakes in global commodity markets are moving prices to a height and the banks are therefore in line with the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer defenders is directed specifically against Chief Deutsche Bank Joseph Ackermann, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Initially, commodity bets were thought to insure traders against price fluctuations.
However, in the meantime, most experts agree that the capital market participants with interest in high-risk trades have been deducted from supply and demand - and made profits to the poorest.
Other than competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann’s criticism: He promised that the charges would check and say that no trade "is worthy of a good reputation of Deutsche Bank being put at stake".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is controlled by discards from Foodwatch-Report.
The audit is to be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank board - together with the recommendation on how this should be done.
On the end of January, the representatives of the Bank want to tell what the consequences are.
In the end, there could be a reduction in trade in commodities or even total refusals.
Ackermann works with his help at his image.
The Chief of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but he also strengthened his criticism of the financial sector: "The betting on rising food prices shows especially drastically, as the banks do today damage the general well."
Have Ackermann as the highest bank lobbyist perform his duties.
"Deutsche Bank must cross all items in which money is used for food prices", said Bode.
"Just whether Mr Ackermann's hunger for people who suffer or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view appears to be surprising, but it's clear that the company's boss had a few months before his departure from the office would like to leave a perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Head of Board of Directors will not pass on to the Supervisory Board.
By turning away from disputed agricultural speculation, it could improve its image.
And the possible losses may not have to be taken care of - this should be the end of his successor.
Each other would account for investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far more than 30,000 Internet users have been involved in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published an survey in which the Forsa Institute questioned 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
At just 11 percent, according to this, he considers it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments with which food prices are linked.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they knew that their bank had been involved in such transactions: Everyone else would have told all the investments in which money was going to speculation with raw materials.
43 percent would warn you before such a bank, 49 percent indicated that they were thinking about cancelling their account and going to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Moved pavilion
Mr Ingeborg Wienowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy end: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 won the prize, became in Vienna Museum, remained empty and abandoned.
Now it's opened again as an exhibition house.
When it is hot for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold booms and new building materials, which are typical of faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is an outstanding and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then given the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and powerful construction of steel and glass.
The construction is considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He celebrated the architect so that he also built a pavilion of Austria for the next world exhibition.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palac plus as a key made by-building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous.
Its construction as a temporary exhibition designed by the pavilion after the world exhibition was placed in Schweizer Garten at the Vienna Südbahnhof (Jižní railway station), renovated and opened the Museum of the 20th century in 1962 - was named "The House of the 20th century".
But suitable for the museum was neither spatially nor technically - missing walls for hanging of artistic exhibits, no matching climate.
Still, it was used until contemporary art was reached in Vienna a new stand.
Since 2001, the building was empty and understood more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilon renovated, it now bears the name "The House of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday night, the Museum of Belvedere, where the palace belongs, the first exhibition - a happy intention in every way.
The new start of Agnes Husslin-Arco, 2007 became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslin-Arco, a renowned historian of art with a significant career, among others in the youth of the tailor, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's Museum and as the founder of Musea Moderna Salzburg, established a strong reconstruction for politicians and memorials, provided public funds and private sponsors and determined the use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritze Wotruby should be exhibited by the same foundation, a coffee shop and bookstore should be created, and an office building should be built to do so.
Close surveillance, low budget.
Then Krischanitz was the perfect cast.
Not only did he have a sensitive reconstruction and expanded the Art Nouveau construction of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but because Schwanzer studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an "immeasurably important place" on which he looked at the exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost to Vienna and changed its use on its generosity and ease.
At this reconstruction there were much greater problems: The building was a "catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of glass facades have been replaced, used glass fibres reinforced with insulation glass and glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
The cold bridges-occelal beams have been strengthened or replaced, asbestos filled with ceilings are channelled.
Two underground floors provided a place for new uses, an abandoned lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, leads to the entrance bridge - almost new building, but still a noble Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door remained preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosive red brown tone.
And the cinema is even the same as it used to be.
All for the strict supervision of the Memorial Office and the low budget.
"It must have often been found material that is good and cheap and also liked the Memorial Office", says Krischanitz and points to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
He said it was difficult with the pavilion, "who came here from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, typical "Drop-in-the-City-historicia".
Such architecture is always "in the wrong place" and still wants to "building proper self-esteem".
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in a bad place, as urbanly happy coincidence happened: In the district around Schweizer Garten there is a completely newly designed "Municipal Quarter at the Main Station" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps another happy coincidence is that the House of the 21st century could receive support from another Krischanitz building, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already running a neighborhood at the Schweizer Garten site.
The track is planning a package for the winter crisis in a million degree
The track evaporated a crisis plan to prevent train blackouts during the winter period.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against the winter caused by train blackouts and delay, Deutsche Bahn issues more than EUR 70 million in the newspaper this year.
The "Bild" paper provided a preliminary report with reference to the internal corporate plan that it was reported that by 2015, about EUR 300 million were to be counted in total.
It is said that a better use of trains and rail networks should also be achieved under extreme weather conditions.
It is said that it is planned, among other things, to double the number of internal and external employees of 16 000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and arrivals.
The aim is to remove the platform until the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of necessary pauses within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the leader warned Rüdiger Gruble after meeting at the highest level with representatives of the government and industry before train blackouts and delays also during this winter.
Last winter, the path in passenger transport had considerable problems, since, among other things, under difficult weather conditions, there was a lack of reserves.
So they await numerous new regional trains for years to be approved by the Spulk Railway Authority.
In addition, the delay in the discharge of the trains of ICE is delayed.
The track has also failed for years to prove that the train repairs of ICE seem to have more frequent control of the workshop when a single train of ICE took place at Köln Central Station for the destruction of the axle.
Deutsche Bank pays a million fines in the US
After the start around boss Josef Ackermann, new troubles occur in the US: Deutsche Bank must pay millions of compensation there.
As if the problems at home were not enough, Deutsche Bank was able to manage the US’s past: Frankfurt’s institution is paying $145 million in one compensation procedure (€106 million) to settle disputes due to bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is about selling mortgage letters.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator calculates a wide range of large banks that led the cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that the risks probably decreased.
Such papers have lost significantly in the course of the crisis, with the bank’s losses to abyss.
"We are satisfied that we could have solved the subject without the parties being forced into court," spokest Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not plead any blame.
This also applies to Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
The chairman of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the respect of both monetary institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US cooperative banks and helps with bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
NCUA is attempting to obtain compensation for the resulting billion damage.
Now the settled compensation is the first of its kind.
The regulator also settled on other large banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in summer.
For questionable mortgage sheets, it's called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble fell through in 2007, it became a lot of financial firms fatal.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed her mind.
Even though the event occurred several years ago, it now blows up banks in the mouths of sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought numerous actions to bring about remedy or affect any doubt.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the biggest complaint.
It concerns 18 international large banks that two U.S. funds dealing with properties of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at mortgage transactions in the volume of about $200 billion have disadvantaged them.
Also Deutsche Bank must face the FHFA action, here it is more trades worth about $14.2 billion in total from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the French Institute be responsible for "substantial losses", without providing an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requirements as unjustified and stated that she wanted to defend herself.
Warren Buffett enters with 10 billion to IBM
The Buffy financial guru invests heavily in IBM's IT-entering firm.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, an important American investor, Warren Buffett, has always declared that it will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies will only allow itself to anticipate difficulties.
He now read IBM’s business report and changed his opinion on investments in the business.
He had much earlier to understand that IBM was primarily offering services and commissioning computer systems for the IT-division of other companies.
The investment by Warren Buffy is in the financial world considered a match to knights.
As a result, the mother mines of IT IBM can now be called "Sir IBM".
For Buffy betrayed the CNB's US economic radio station, that he had bought IBM's $10.7 billion shares since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffy said neither IBM knew anything about his involvement yet.
He praised management, which he tried for the economic crisis, even for good returns.
"You've done a great job," said Buffy to the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time on speculative IT services such as the operation of computing centres.
More than 100 years of computer pioneer also offers software and advice for companies.
Buffett avoided technology companies until today.
It claims that it invests only to companies whose activities it also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached the freight railway, the manufacturer of lubricants or after the manufacture of machinery.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns around 80 of its own subsidiaries also shares in a number of large consortias such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Münchener Rück.
In the 1960 ’ s, the 81 - year - old gentleman took over a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and built it with wise investments by one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore an iconic figure for many investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of making money brought him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
When Buffy's investment became known, IBM's shares increased by one percent before the storm began.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total price of over $220 billion on the stock exchange and is considered together with Apple and Microsoft for the world's most valuable technological enterprises.
At Microsoft's, so much Buffy, but she wouldn't want to get in.
The founder of Bill Gates says he's a confidential friend.
The hazard is tangible
After the discovery of the "Buňky in Zwickau" the Turkish media have doubted the German rule of law.
The newspaper even speaks of "bloody ideology", which now resurrects.
The murders of eight small Turkish entrepreneurs and one Greek in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was addressed in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany by fear and concern.
For for many German Turks, this brings back the horror that was long considered dead: From the arson attacks in Mölln November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there was no comparable violence with right-wing extremist background.
That there was a xenophobia in Germany, but there was never any doubt about it.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals the extent that the dimension of which is no longer visible.
The headlines of the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasises that one of the perpetrators should be a secret police agent of the Department for the Protection of the Institute and fear that also the German authorities could be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
Appreciatively reacted by the Turkish community in Germany: She remembered the weekend of demonstrations of silence before Brandeburg by the victim of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin remembered, together with German and Turkish politics, the solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In happy colours, a common life has been staged - as a history of success.
As a fields, several Turkish media reports here: "The gift of Germany to 50inami" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which reports about the background of the murderous series.
Also, the publication of the letter "Hürriyet" for Germany does not take to do this idea link.
"It's starting to stink," says Ahmed Külahci's column.
He points out that people who paid taxes and did their work have an important contribution to the recovery of Germany were murdered.
The police procedure and its late success in the search are being discussed most critically in the German Internet forums.
Why did the German authorities not think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, authors are surprised.
Thus many are shown at least rhetorically prepared to use drastic means: "If there is still activity so superficially, the immigrants will not be anything but their own defense and armed."
"It's probably the best self-defense."
"In the quality of clarification and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network, internal peace in Germany ", writes "Selen".
What if internal peace in Germany is at risk, it explains the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the burntout in Solingen is deeply embedded in the memory of Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it clear to the living Turks that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and distance may lead to right-wing violence
However, the assassinations made a more apparent sense of mutuality on the side of the Turks.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press criticized the failure of German politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl rejected those in Mölln who survived.
After the Jewish attack in Solingen, he sent a private telegram to the Turkish State President, but at a wake-up call at Köln to join his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel, in his speech, calculated what fees Turkey had paid.
Quite as if the value of man was measured according to the level of his taxes.
The current Turkish media intelligence shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in this state-of-the-art rule is.
In addition to the efforts to make extensive clarifications and the new evaluation of right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
Scandinavian bank near the Curysian lake
Europe's most adventurous bank does not have its seat in Italy or France but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered almost bankruptcy from the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to another.
Now he's got to compare it to some German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his noisy departure from the head of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that 2013 would enter almost as many spectacular new jobs as possible: the President of the Swiss Government of the Grand Bank of Switzerland - an unexpected and lucrative step in careers.
Axel Weber enjoyed public service, praised Switzerland whether for its beauty and the UBS for its new solidness and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached its turn."
"I'm looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September, it was clear that everything would be completely different.
One UBS dealer in London covered all bank security systems and lost approximately 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland's recognized banker, had to leave.
The President of the Management Board of the UBS has been burned since then - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already become known that Weber bank has been able to advise since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Management Board will take over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
It's gonna be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he would certainly need time to work.
At the same time, we will take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has just once again proved to deserve the title "Banka of Europe's greatest scandals"
For the UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - but it has been for years since one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, will remain a proud Swiss bank saved.
It started for the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had excellent reputations.
Image of the silent and solid, but also of the sophisticated asset manager combined with ambitious objectives: It also wanted something to mean in investment banking.
Thus, UBS managed, on the one hand, with $1.6 billion more money from overseas clients than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she acted as an investment bank to the league of the world’s largest banks.
That made sense.
The former banker and later long-term professor of banking in Zurich Hans Geiger says: "I always described my students as a model of good banks at the time of the UBS."
"From this point of view, you ask, "How could I be so wrong?"
He was wrong a lot.
In 2007, it was clear for the first time that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the head of board of directors, who has so far been regarded as a highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker.
A few months later, he wondered why he left.
The bank's investment division promrhala Subprime-instructions and had to write down billions.
To settle this, UBS has actually raised capital of 13 billion francs.
Indeed, it was found by investors, but one that had recently been ravaged by the nose: the opportunity Asian state fund from Singapore and the Arab state fund, which was so discreet that man could not even know his name.
But that was just the first hit.
Things got worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to admit new billion losses, President of Marcel Ospel's Governing Board, the second best paid by the Swiss Board, resigned.
The disaster followed in October 2008: UBS was standing due to its poor investment in the financial crisis before collapse and had to be rescued by the State.
Nationalbank bought out of UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs to mandatory exchangeable bonds for which it could become a bank co-owner.
The whole Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic for a small country when it had such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see picture).
"We couldn't save the UBS once again," says the bank expert Geiger.
There's a second one for the first disaster.
For several months now, UBS has capitalized in a tax dispute with America and has shown willingness to issue data of the overseas customers, who have reduced their taxes as far as possible by the bank.
In addition, she agreed to pay $78 million - to return unlawful profits from these transactions, including fines.
This proved more or less open to UBS that it helped cut taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in a competition for wealthy clients: a marriage minister of discretion.
After this scandal, there was no Swiss bank secret of what had happened before.
Following the resignation of the Head of Board and the President of the Board of Directors.
And exodus customer money.
Thus, the Bank has lost its credibility over several months in both central business areas: in investment banking due to poor speculation and in the administration of capital assets for tax reduction.
And just when things got a little calm, just when UBS thought they recovered again, here comes this unfortunate business engagement: The only dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something wrong.
And it's clear that the management of the risk in investment banking seems to be still unattractive.
"Adoboli's case probably found that risk control has changed too little", says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz Professor of Finance at Zürich University Banking Institute.
The financial director of the large German bank is also certain: "The UBS programme consists in failing to control the risks."
After all, it was precisely the idea of caution that Swiss bankers had advanced a long time ago in order to become guardians of the great assets of the world: no too much risk, including security for money - also from this side of the Republic of Alpine again broke down.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol of inexhaustible reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for a particularly high quality chocolate.
UBS Central in Zurich still fits the climate of the good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bit bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its main seat in the Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curysian lake, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings here are beautiful, shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Kleining as Tiffany's will be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries it has been established here by the Swiss bank: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall enters with a hard-headed door.
Inside are walls covered with marble, a massive leather chair standing in front of them, next to the bank's logo a big direction towards the "sejfu".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of Switzerland's two large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, however, have sometimes pushed or betrayed as the head of one small Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not read in the paper, it eventually closes, like all Swiss bankers, also with both big banks.
UBS was probably too big, researching, especially in investment banking, where Anglosas was expanded.
I don't think Swiss people have anything to say about it.
"And if they had, they would have adapted long ago to the English ways."
It was indeed an English investment banking that UBS changed, brought her first high profits and then a disaster: No European Financial Institute lost as much money as Schweizer Großbank in the jungle around Subprime.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"In that center, the government coalitions of the small seven million countries took place on the largest rescue event in the history of their nation," writes Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to EUR 68 billion or some EUR 45 billion were approved by politicians to save from the bankruptcy of a large bank.
How did that happen?
If the Swiss bankers speak, they see the problem especially in the UBS size.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks joined the massive group.
There was a bank that was already too big for small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
In turn, it helped that both different bank predecessors of UBS added: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a mining centre in the administration of assets and poorer but internationally more involved.
All of a sudden, internalised investment bankers came to benefit many of the money they could have made a big roulette.
With this increase UBS are associated with two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 the head of UBS and Marcel Ospel, then the Chairman of the Management Board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a team of futures," says Hans Geiger's banking expert.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows much about models and statistics and Ospel, man manages feelings around his stomach, which he developed from banking sciences to the top."
But Ospel said he was counting on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli probably made some critical mistakes at the end: "As he thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
The pride preceded the fall.
The employees of the UBS clearly remember the possessions of the leaders of the staff, on which the company's boss Wuffli repeated the same password again: beat Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She said "League Tables", a ringer that documents the success of the bank at that time.
She tried to put the UBS up on top of it.
She's done a few steps already.
In the trade of currency and shares, games were involved on top of the list.
However, business advisors who have been entrusted with the task highlight one weakness: in international interest trade, in the statement of bankers "Fixed Income", there is probably a great distance behind the biggest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in US mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS agreed to an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Both after growth, the Bank itself and its own fund invested in providing risks to American Subprime investments.
It developed into a powerful machine that repacked securities on American mortgage loans and passed on - but also left itself risks.
Also, when the rest of the banks had long been looking for the east.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," says the bank expert Geiger.
It's as big as the euphoria, as deep as it is.
One manager after another had to leave when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than he thought.
The positions at the UBS have become a catapultative seat, and they're still on to it.
Who is running the Grand Bank now has nearly an impossible job.
They have to find a strategy for the banks that all close trading models have disappeared.
Geiger's banking expert has already had the idea: No more investment banking, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
Even though the bank does not want to go so far.
But the investment banking is going to hold heavily, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to introduce his future strategy to the world.
In fact, the 51-year-old Swiss Italian was understood only as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he settled: He has long run the business of UBS, she has communicated the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to reinstate the investment bank in the mid-1990s.
3500 marked seats.
That won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money?
These are the questions Axel Weber already asks.
But the public says only that she will find an apartment with her lady first in Zurich.
Next year.

Intelligent gates spread in cities
In many places, field ravens are seen as "problem birds": But from cities, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be evicted, claiming experts.
They like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: The crows have been part of the city's image for centuries, yet in some municipalities they are gathering complaints of the people to uncleanness and noise caused by the animals.
There's still no cure for "problem birds" in sight.
Havrans of the field probably cannot be evicted from the city, told experts on the first symposia of the crows in the East African Leer.
There, experts from all over the Land consulted on possible exits.
They're looking for alternatives in cities.
Nature conservations have also caused urban problems from exodus particularly protected field havrans: The use of chemistry in agriculture is about increasingly destroying the traditional area for life.
Persecution, growing construction and cutting of typical trees make life difficult for birds to nest.
The gates are protected.
The large colonies with over 600 nesting couples are among others in the western Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Brem and Leer.
There, the 2005 disputed project of mass killing broke in the rural period negative headlines.
Critics have identified the capture of animals into traps for birds and the killing of cages for particularly brutal.
"Normal extortion, weeping, it doesn't bring anything," so much discovered urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver from Leera.
The removal of nest by spraying water or cutting trees often has undesirable consequences, also said the expert on the environment Manfred Kaiser from Lahru in Badensko-Württembersk.
"The animals step down, the large colony barks and divides into other places."
Swimming is only thought to be an exception to hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
The combination of banishing animals from sensitive residential areas is thought to settle down at other places.
"The information board instead of chain saws" promoted the psychologist and ethnoologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different treatment of animals: "One stroke in the face can eventually become the best of self-confidence."
Mrs Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg's teaching trail, which provides informationboard lessons on the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to be already accepted by tourists.
Also, Mrs Jürgens's opinion on the criticism of bird noise was: "Here it is every volume of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligentness and masculineness of animals are legendary: The ravens do not use only the aid to reach the pamphlet, but even as a help of their instrument will come to light.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested behavior on four field ravens, how far there is the identification of birds.
In one experiment the birds quickly learned that the stones must lead to the ruins of the structure in order to reach the raccoon.
Without great training, they recognized what size and shape the stone must have to cause collapses of the platform.
In the second attempt, the lubricated crows had to solve a more brilliant problem.
In a vertically built cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with a magnifying pier.
The birds could not reach their prey.
But researchers put pieces of wire in them.
From them, all four animals had a hook, which she used as a femur to hunt out of a tube for a holder.
The three of the four field ravens have even succeeded in the back.

Massacre at personal level
Emoally powerful new book by Peter Englunda entitled Beauty and sorrow: The Trustful History of World War I (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of emerging characters, until your head turns your head.
One advice how to maintain yourself at that moment: Use this careful side to keep out and make a new tab on it.
For all people are familiar with Mr. Englunda's novel story, and this list will serve you as a navigation - like a beacon - in times like men and women in the story you will feel confused and lost in various situations.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
She is also a new deputy on the Swedish Academy, which grants Nobel Prize for literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it quite appropriately, as an "antihistorical work".
It contains several well known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, almost lacked ambassadors, energetic journalists and debate on tactics and equipment.
It's not even a book about what happened, it explains the author, as well as the "book about what it was." It deals mainly with "senses, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Crass and sorrows" combines 20 more fewer fewer men and women on both sides of the barricades, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others will become war prisoners, lose their limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives dazzle like the flames of candles burned in a church - new ones are added to the confusion of destiny while others are extinguishing.
Mr Englunda's book differs from classic historical novels.
He manages the idea that the first World War was just about horrific trenches in the West front.
"Beautiful and sorrow" explores also other places where war drama was held: Alps, Balkans, East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with the fact that bee nests fall upon them, must spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramid, or face the presence of tse-tse flies.
Almost from the beginning, it's a very touching reading.
War will devour people's lives like some natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling gunpowder.
When you start calling gun shooting at a distance, and you're a woman who's home with your kids, run or stay?
Who's approaching it, anyway?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why the whole war was set up.
"The vacuum created by lack of facts," noted Mr. Englund, "was filled with guesses, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Break and sorrow" follows the stories of individuals, such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are taken from CVs, letters and other published materials in the village.
The descriptions of their lives can sound scary and appealing, but by integrating tiny moments and details are absolutely lively and credible.
Many of them are dealing with food and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "replacements, substitutes all over the place."
"A cup of coffee, made of aluminium, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It is referred to as "meat made of pressed rice cooked in a kraft (and supplemented with fake bone from wood), tobacco from dried shells and dried potato shells, beech shoes with wooden soles".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes during the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about virtue and bravery.
One American finds himself in an inner ashes of wildness and brutality, although he declares of war: "At the end, you will understand that this is human nature. However, sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or a good book and pretending that this mask represents civilization and that there is no barbar behind the starchy self in the inside."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that, most likely, he will die soon and no one will notice, let alone mourn.
"When one finally reconciles with the sacrifice, at least he expects to become so before the sight of the grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like a "sentipation that he secretly hangs."
Further comments on the departure of old Europe and the arrival of new horrors.
"The conflict has become more and more economic competition and competition," writes Mr. Englund, "war between factories."
He caught what the new kind of beast of the coming century says: an eloquent and ideologically entangled mass killer in the clothes cut in peace, doing his bloodshed without standing up from the table.
People act totally unexpectedly, the subterraneans are dealing with heroism.
Mr Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some kind of sexual illness from prostitutes to avoid the service on the front.
"The most dangerous example of this behavior was the trading of gonococa puss, which soldiers bought and hit by soldiers in hopes of ending in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate of them even torn into their eyes, which has often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englunda's rod is observable, but not obvious, which fits the human subject.
In tens of minor outputs, the way war "resolved with absolutely inconsistencies: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I mostly worked with signs, such as the "First World War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussella or novels as "The West Front of Peace" by Erich Maria Remarquea.
Mr. Englund prefers an unorthodox concept.
His book has the most crushing endings that populously science literature does not possess.
But I will not betray him to you.
But you'll feel as if suddenly the author jumped out of the book, took the page out of the list of heroes out of his hand and set it on fire.
After the previous mistake this minute exactly scheduled event
She was attended by hundreds of police officers, some of them in helmets used in street riots.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at that time Zuccotti Park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the event except for a few highly built officers, the others were initially told that this was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
There were no repeat cases from the last few weeks, for example, when pepper sprays were used against protesters, which broke the department rules, and in addition, the wave of sympathies turned over to the squareters side of the public.
This is why police operations were aimed at cleaning Zuccotti Park from protesters, started after two weeks of careful planning and training.
Leaders have been inspired by operations taking place in other cities.
Massive exercises for behavior in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island section, which was a preparation for the event at Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have strengthened the so-called training to suppress riots - counter-terristic measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of policemen - with a focus on the urban part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" said someone who originally was explained only as "training".
"I know a few policemen who were also called into this event, and they certainly didn't say that they were going to Zuccotti park," said the person who spoke only on condition that she would remain anonymous.
"The fact that you're going to Zuccotti Park, they knew only the most of the members of the department."
One reason for hiding was a lesson that had already been given to the city.
On October 14, the city’s representatives planned to clean the park, but then retreated from the plan, because as soon as the protesters heard about it, they got involved before the operation started in the park for hundreds of years.
Tuesday's events were attended by police officers from different units, including intervention groups from around here - dozens of policemen who are commonly used to strengthen Thursdays with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that he was coming to the park during the day, leaving a large number of people, so one hour of the night was the perfect time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do so at a time when he would be in a park as few people as possible," he said.
Before the units went off, they settled on the streets of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge Bridge Bridge Bridge Bridge bridge, cargo vehicles of emergency units with arc lamps and amplións.
The lights and recorded reports of amplionous amplionation have scared many protesters.
When the board members entered the park in their blue windmills, many protesters packed their things and left.
Police say that until 1:45 a.m., she didn't touch a single state, which meant to give the protesters time to pack up their things.
The other teams of police officers were spotted gathering at the edge of the park so that they could enter it if there was a need for arrest.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Chief spokesperson of the police department, Paul J Browne, claimed that it was for their safety.
However, many journalists feel that the police wanted to stop them from seeing her troops in action, and in addition, some police officers treated them roughly.
Mr Browne claimed that television cars in Church Street leading along the western border of the park could have been shot without any problems.
Police proceeded in the western direction and snuck through with a heavy collection of personal protestors, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothing, followed by teams from the sanitary department who immediately lost everything in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were removed from the park, documenting image materials appeared shortly after the internet.
The most vast group of protestors fled to the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which was located near the center of the park.
Some created a roadblock and the police began their methodological arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp joined each other.
And two people tied to the tree, said Mr. Kelly.
The members of the emergency services were summoned to take over the locks.
Until 3:30 in the park there were no arrests, you announced Kelly.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police heard.
Mr. Browne said there were some 142 people in the park.
Most arrests took place because of "organisation of riot and resisting arrest," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, chief of police department, was the highest-level uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, Detective Commander at the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "He didn't participate in the management of the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The second group of policemen waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street streets, in case it was necessary to call her.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street street, a block south of the park, roadblocks were drawn.
From these places, the police have developed a protection zone even further from Zuccotti Park.
There were police officers in one place, many of whom were equipped with shields, as extruded by people further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the north border.
The most expensive events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 A.M., one protester was spotted south of Pine Street, jumped onto a police car hood, and several others who released the air from the tires of a police van.
One minute from the crowd, there was a piece of scrape.
At the end of the operation, a police officer was hospitalized and one protestor.
The Federation of Assistant Workers will sue the city for release
Departments representing hundreds of school aid workers who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday. They claim that redundancies were not necessary and, moreover, discrimination was due to an disproportionate impact on schools that visit poor students.
The Court of Justice is likely to be the last option left to the trade unions in District Council 37 in their efforts to reverse the enforcement decision.
On the 7th of October, six hundred school assistants, parent coordinators and other staff who were among the highest paid employees of the city lost their work. Their release by the union leaders was described as a payoff of the city for not allowing him access to the healthcare fund managed by the work force, using which the city wanted to make a hole in the budget.
City leaders have refused this charge of categoricals.
At the meeting of the City Council held last month, the Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the Council immediately argued that there was no specifically talk in the budget about the release of auxiliary workers.
City leaders of District Council 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. In the middle they would call for a press conference, where they would formally notify the Supreme State Court of Manhattan.
The defendants will be Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the defendant will be eight workers, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, the spokesperson of the city's legal department, said that the city hasn't seen the lawsuit yet, and that's why he won't speak to each charge.
According to the motion for a complaint received by the New York Times, the trade unions focused on the quantities released in poor parts of the city, which wanted to support their claims about unfair conduct, because they considered that poor schools had lost more assistants because they had long been denied sufficient funding.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island did not leave at all, and only at least at the Upper East Side, Brooklyn, in the District 23 in Brownsville lost the work of 17 school assistants and in parts District 8 and 9 in South Bronx, even 46 assistants were released.
He recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five of the eight assistants lost their jobs, although it's a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty.
Public School's budget 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way of calculating bonus finances for each poor student applied.
In addition, the unions claim that Central School Directors could have been confused in a way that was written a document approving parental coordinators.
The document used the word "excess" to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school's payroll to the database of available workers whose wages are played by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators have been released," says the complaint, "and not only moved to a database for the position of available workers."
Mission is over, Congress is ready to adopt an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats at the Congress seem to have a value for something about the rise in Libya.
However, before this occurred, the revolution had to succeed for a long time, the ruling dictator Muammar Kaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States forces closed.
On Tuesday the Senate's International Relations Commission will decide on the statements supported by President John Kerry (Mass) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which he should congratulate the Libyans on their successful rebellion and US troops for "statality".
"This statement we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who began to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Our parties to the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The sentences may seem innocent, but no debate that has been about Libya has been easy.
During the summer, the legislators from both sides were constantly arguing with both themselves and the White House on the wording of a series of statements for approval or, on the contrary, rejecting the military role of the United States in NATO, Libya.
In June, they presented Kerry and McCain with a resolution authorising the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the different views of both political parties, so the Senate never voted for it.
However, the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures which would halt the financing of US operations in Libya.
The US mission in Libya was literally found in legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama was managing the mission, but its members obviously did not bother him enough to stop supporting him in his initiation.
The weighty congress finally preceded other events.
The rebels conquered Tripoli in August and on October 20th, Kaddafi was killed.
Mission Nato officially ended October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations in its statement "Congratulates the inhabitants of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable toughness that they have spent trying to free their people" and "glors the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies who have engaged in an operation to protect the Libyan population for extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "confirms the United States' national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will a new proposal fully support the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators be divided again into two half, such as when approving the June proposal?
Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), chief representative of the Republican Party in the commission, was built against the last version.
Lugar's spokesperson said Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
This week, the House will vote on the amendment to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution concerning the budget or other subject to which the whole House or Senate will vote.
For the time being, the other legislators have not yet managed to push their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is only one of 68 additions to the constitution, which was presented at the congress and touched a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal put forward by the House and the Senate - and others are just minor exchanges of others.
Only in the House can at least 15 versions of the budget allowance and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their advocates - especially emerging Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast their 'authority'.
The contribution to the budgetary regulation approved in August required the House and the Senate to vote on the amendment concerning the balanced budget.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of the non-binding declaration to support the creation of such a supplement.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss the number of periods in which members of the congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wishes to increase the number of periods that may be acceptable to the President.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a whole range of supplements which would, besides, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The persistent proposal remains an amendment prohibiting marriages of equal sex and an amendment prohibiting the burning of the flag of a state.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two-thirds of states stand up against them.
Although it seems that members of Congress are very active in designing various supplements, compared to previous years, however, they do not significantly exclude from the average.
At 111th, Congress offered 77 supplements, while at the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity is even pale compared to the early 1990s, when members offered more than 150 supplements every two years according to the statistics of the Senate Library.
However, they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last addition, which was added - 27th Appendix - was ratified in 1992, but in fact the Congress was designed in 1789.
"While but not defeated," says Gifford in his first TV interview from the shooting
Ten months after an immediate nearby shooter injured her at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) discovered her on Monday night on national television, she sang along with the melodies of the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that more than a return to Congress is worth getting better.
Giffords appeared on "20/20" at the ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the formation of theorem still makes her problems and needed help during the walk.
The whole show documented its difficult reconvalence, which was necessary for the damage caused by the bullet that broke through her skull at the front, penetrated her left half of the brain and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate triumphally in the vote on the debt ceiling.
On her first television interview from the January shooting, during which six people were killed, and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, smiled and sang - she described her recovery as "observable".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, she replied to the 21-year-old Giffords, "It's all good."
A conversation with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hourly feature of the show '20/20', which was broadcast at the beginning of the issue of the new book of this couple, called 'Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope'.
The specialist's been following the entire reconscence of Gifford from the shooting on January 8th.
On videos that Kelly made during the first week of the week, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across the entire forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more at that time than just lift up one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and therapist teaching her how to do simple activities.
Head lashing.
My lips are leaking.
And then, her first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "toy" when she requested changes in her breakfast.
The videos from the ABC station show that Giffords played music: the Congresswoman sings music on them together with a melodic therapist to the song "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During Gifford's interview, which spends two hours a day on therapy, Sawyer said that the day of the shooting, she doesn't remember anything.
Her husband said that the Giffords read the paper on the shooting on March 12th, when she first asked him who was six, who was killed in the incident.
From the shooting, the suspect Jared Lee Loughner, who's being held in the Missouri Prison, where he's waiting for a court trial under the influence of violently administered drugs.
"A lot of people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Horse, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer said that at one point his wife said, "I lost."
"So I just told her, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly said.
"You're just getting a dump.
But you can do it, you'll get back together, and you'll get even stronger than ever."
Military forces encounter compassion rather than respect
This event was a Wall Street galave who spent millions of dollars on New York war vets who didn't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, flyers and Marines ran by him.
The famously dressed crowd rose up and gnawing excitedly.
"The men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
On the other hand, Admiral Mike Mullen, who, however, saw the role of military units somewhat different, took part in the celebration evening.
"They were all introduced as orphans," wrote an officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect.
The totally opposite impressions merely illustrates the difficult relationship between the army and often the measured, sometimes celebrating American public.
The soldier is immediately involved in praise for his victims.
But these praises stand, they say soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if a single in uniform regretted.
"We are not victims at all," said Brig-Gen Sean B. MacFarland, who was commanding troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way that some people can support us is to build us into the role of unhappy souls."
This theme is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or to mess up relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face by those returning from Vietnam was much worse.
The result is that most words of pity are carried out in silence and in private between war veterans.
When two sons of Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat events where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two angles.
From the point of view of some, they will feel respect and amazement, because they defeated enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
Others will drill their heads, if "under the surface there is no evil, violent veteran," Cancian said, who participated in the fights in Iraq, and after returning he took a place in Washington, government.
He claimed that when he was looking for work, some of the people who interviewed him were inconclusively suggesting whether soon after his return to the fight he could resist the stress associated with his work in Washington.
"If you talk about your ministry, you must count on negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
The dismay of the army is partly sourced from American indifference to wars.
Success in the battle field is not often enough to remove recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and its war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation no longer appreciates military heroism as it used to be common during World War II," said Lieutenant David Barno, who was commanding American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public is focused mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are recorded for the number of events they suffered, the number of friends they lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing growing pressure to hard hit rape
This week, it will decide whether a court trial of 28 women and men against the army will be launched due to alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, they are prepared to file a lawsuit with hundreds of other applicants.
The first class of Private Elizabeth Lyman was reportedly raped by her army colleague 25 and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she was heading to the barracks on the Miramar air base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, maybe she could have a little drink in her room.
"In my head there was a light on," Lyman described.
But the native Texasan totally ignored her objections.
No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
He claims that only a few minutes after they walked into her room, a man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18th, Lyman and 27 other existing or former military members will be waiting for a hearing verdict that might have a historic impact. It will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will go to see if the accusation against former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessors, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The charge states that Gates and Rumsfeld have failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
However, during the coming months, their number grew to 28 - 25 women and three men who all claim to be raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and that the army failed to investigate, punish and any pursuit of justice after the announcement of these attacks.
Burke says he's going down the throat to the top commanders of the army, because the problem starts with them.
"Armada is a direct system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent the introduction of measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other actions brought forward in the future.
Its strategy: Rather than group all charges in this case - would lay all eggs in one basket, as it itself says - it will bring actions in more different cases if it is necessary not to pour any pressure.
The defense team of the U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, together with his co-workers, has given an incentive to reject the case.
The documents received by Newsweek are detailed in the defence strategy - in principle, it is that current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for the injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
Under the 1950 Supreme Court order called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries that soldiers will suffer in active service.
"Securities relating to military services of the defendants" shall be recorded in the document.
The Ministry of Defense refused to express itself on this matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Even though women are still officially not allowed to serve in combat, it is only vocabulary: in modern wars, it is only difficult to find clear lines.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers have played an increasing role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers fell among these wars - two-thirds of them directly in combat.
It's time for modernisation even in the army, explaining Burke.
She's not alone in her fight, except for her case, there are three other legal representatives involved.
At Yale law school, visitors are preparing a Veteran seminar on legal services of action for the four main military academy for the alleged development of the atmosphere supporting hatred for women.
Independently of the nonprofit organization of American Vietnamese veterans collects evidence for his lawsuit against the military. This action focuses on the diagnosis of "persons of personality", which was reportedly found in the rape victim to have an excuse for their release - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, is a very common practice.
In December, her group has already filed an action against the state organisation for dealing with vets accused of discriminatory practices involving persons who claimed to be sexually assaulted in the service when processing applications for assistance.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress, presented by a group of senators and Members from both political parties and proposed a whole range of corrective measures.
3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unannounced in most cases and according to their own estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19 000 incidents that occurred in that year.
In a report issued in March, the criminal prosecution rate of suspects is also broken down: 20 percent of cases reported in the army were reported in the court in 2010 - half of which is compared to the civilian judicial system.
The complainants in the case of Deputy Burke describe attacks only as the first in a series of traumas.
First class Private Lyman reported, for example, an alleged rape of military police less than an hour after it was expected to occur.
During the night, she says she was asked to repeat eleven times the various police, doctors and commanders of her rape.
She took all the tests she needed to determine the rape and the blood of the attacker was found in her bed - from the wound she made him on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman received a hearing before a court that asked her questions about whether she was in love with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were summoned, who, as witnesses of the rumors, spoke in favour of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually released.
"I remember the day that judgment was taken," says Lyman.
"I had a feeling that I was going to give birth right there - with a scream I ran out of the courtroom."
"They placed me on a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer, "It wasn't his trial, it was mine."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist who was eventually diagnosed with personality disorder, indicating her as ineligible to the ministry.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and thus without any permission to serve.
Whether the Lyman case and the other plaintiffs move into the next phase or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, professor of law law at George Washington Law University.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to proceed to the further stages of the discussion."
But between them and the Verdicum, the doctrine mentioned has been criticized since the first moment that the light of the world has seen.
I myself am a lifelong critic for the doctrine of Feres Doctrine.
The army is a few decades behind, because their duties do not follow the same level of motivational incentives and repellents.
He adds, "The poles are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
There will only be change if good people are willing to fight.
If there is no decision in the hearing to their benefit, Burke, the defendant's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other persons ready to file a complaint and start working on other case-laws relating to this issue.
"We will not cease to fight the military on this issue, where there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, based on what comes sooner.
The walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous grievous after which 77 were left in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, in cyberspace he was not lonely: during the preparation of the attack he spent a lot of time with his computer, he chatted with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networks websites.
After this summer's tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy - just go on Facebook.
"We realized that finding them, it's not really that hard," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of recently published reports from the British research team on European digital populism.
The amount of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett, that scientists have had enough to simply use advertising on the site and have determined with absolute precision the respectable demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe, though they focused on attention and advertisements. However, instead of inviting them to join the newly created group or offering them some dietary products, they invited them to fill out a questionnaire asking questions about their level of education, their relation to violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from over 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a completely new way of conducting research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: on-line supporters of right-wing groups are among the young men who defy the growing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "to those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more rational, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the screen of the computer."
The EMOS team's work is only one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use this site to study everything, from health problems to social trends that cover up to state updates, contributions to walls and press buttons "I like myself".
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users each day provide three different data on average, which makes this social network literally "information supernova", which stands behind the development of many new research. The number of academic work in whose name is the word Facebook, increased over five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them on the street.
"It used to be hard to identify people when you wanted to carry out a survey among British people."
"You'd have to go to a party where you'd never get let go," says Bartlett.
"This is all Facebook's breaking down - you're just going straight to them."
Others argue that the website can offer a way to identify the social-health problem and avoid them.
In a recent study by Dr Megan Moren from the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that the university students who discussed their drinking output on Facebook were much more threatened with the problem of alcoholism than students who were silent about this topic.
Moren suggests that students' peers monitor the site and come with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunk status.
"The problem cannot be resolved if you cannot diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Morenová and Director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We've found a way to identify vulnerable children, otherwise we don't have a chance to discover."
Facebook self-searches the data of its users all the time.
The website information team has developed statistics on the relationship status and day of St. Valentine's day, election participation in 2010 and the national satisfaction rate (mainly using the information they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long claimed that the website should make their information available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometres away, you need to provide your personal information on the website.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. However, online data are available to everyone.
"In my opinion most users did not think that scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist in London Knowedge Lab, a study conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"If it was about them, they took it so that there was only information between them and their friends."
Consequently, it is also to consider the question of methodology.
Even in off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is absolutely sincere.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much information on the profile and contributions to the wall is true.
"What do you say on Facebook and what you do out of Facebook, these are two totally different things," she explains.
That's why Selwin, who spent years researching new technologies, thinks that pencil and notebook continue to remain the best instrument ever to be used in research.
"If you go to the real world and you talk to real people, it's something you can't replace," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line."
"Cold and Nonhuman": Anders Behring Brezik participates in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to ossing two attacks, during which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway, during his first public hearing in Oslo himself described himself as a fighter of the "defence".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among Norwegian Templar Knights," said the court where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the Court of Justice because your mandate has been granted to organisations that promote the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I don't blame them."
Judge Torkel Nesheim Breivika interrupted during this monologue because "he did not want to give Brevik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform from which he could make his views known."
For the same reason, Brevikov, who brought along the prepared speech, refused to allow his victims to address their victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for the next 12 weeks, ban any contact with the media for 4 tonnes and announce that the competent authorities will have complete control over all of his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 relatives of victims and survivors participated in the hearing.
Some have come in hope that they will be able to look Brevik in the eye, others to make sure that they are kept firmly under lock.
They were all involved to move the case to close quickly.
"I felt he looked cold and unhuman," said the commentator of the NRC one of the survivors of the attack.
"It was nothing pleasant, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard a suspect, I mentally moved again a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. When coming and leaving to the building without difficulties with regard to present journalists and survivors to the eyes.
Despite the Breivik's bizarre idea that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge admitted that he was not insane, and noted that there was no evidence that he had an accomplice.
For someone it may be comforting that the attacks of June 22 seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the sorrows and confusions that are still in the minds and hearts of the nation.
"I wish she had come out as a monster, but it is not so," said one of the victims' relatives.
"If I did, things would be a lot easier."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie going to the movies this week
On October 5, when Steve Jobs died, people who compared him to Henry Ford began to come forward with the greatest modern invention of his genius.
At the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted for a special film, which is headed for cinema this week, will be the fact that for all Apple fans the fact that his creative mind completely understood business processes and workflows worth its products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer, and a self-represented member of the Hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a man who put every detail on the smallest details - believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "the real great idea of 90 percent of their work... [but] between the excellent idea and the excellent result is still a long journey to the work season."
In 1995 Bob Cringely worked on the TV series Triumph Computer Madness, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the recording, there was a unique, more than an hour interview.
At the time, it was ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had his hands full with his new computer company NeXT, and he was eagerly looking at how the general public would accept the Internet.
In TV, only a short part of the entire Cringely interview was used and the original copies of interviews were reported to have been lost during the transfer.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
Just this material, slightly trimmed, forms the basis of the 68-minute film by Steve Jobs: Lost interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has heard his failure to provide longer conversations, Jobs here is as surprisingly excited to be able to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also turns out to be a very perceptive person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it is seen how Jobs perfectly think about being as high as possible and as precise as possible.
The moments of Jobs’ perfectionism, when Cringely’s questions are becoming impatient and prompting him to get to the more important problems and issues more quickly.
The interview was shot before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, and it appears in it to be horrificly prophetic ideas when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and badly, offering their own vision of the future in computer technology.
One thing is to read the postmortem evaluation of Jobs' career, but on Jobs, which we see here as a eager dream in the bloom of his genius, is something raw and inspiring.
He's got his own vision of how things could and should look.
He did not take long, and after speaking his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
Quick summary of the seven scenes from lost interview, which is definitely worth notice:
How he learned to manage the business:
"In business years, I always asked, "Why do you do this?" And the answer was the same every time: Well, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, never thinking about business things deep.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify Apple's accounts.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - often they started with the inscription "standard costs", the amount of them could only be assumed. At that time he decided to go out his own way - developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could identify the commercial costs in a moment.
How he made the gill on the Pope:
Jobs remembers the "Modrou box" prepared by Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to hack effectively into a telephone company and to call anywhere in the world free of charge.
It has been written about the device in the past, but Jobs' enthusiasm, when the Blue Box describes as an instrument of power, is literally contagious.
It tells us how the facility and Wozniak tested the device using the pay phone and got connected from one AT&T network to another during the call, while they used as many satellites as possible.
"At least half a dozen times we got past the world, so when we screamed at the paid phone, it was one minute later from the other phone at the door," Jobs laughed.
"We were young, and we found out that we could build up a thing that is capable of managing infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
The two of us made a little thing, which managed to control a much bigger giant -- it was an incredible experience, and I don't think Apple would never make it without it.
Jobs continues by describing the prank that had almost reached the end with Wozniak. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could speak to the Pope, with as best as possible serving Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, the members of the Catholic Church were called further to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and only just before they woke up the Pope himself, the couple became sick and laid down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he found his phone number on Bill Hewlett and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had a secured summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I've ever met and formed my view of what such a company is and how to treat my employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research lab at Palo Alto, where he saw the "first table computer that ever was made".
He was big as a trunk, had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him immediately.
As a teenager in HP, I progressed higher and higher, hang around that computer and start writing programs for him.
How they think of innovation:
In several places, Jobs speaks during the interview about how he makes new products running.
At the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a few boards with full connections, one customer asked him to build a whole computer for him.
Only 30 paid days were available, during which he had to invent, to mount even the finished equipment.
When he was at Apple later, he recalls the problems they were facing in the development of computer mice:
"I remember we had a pretty wild fight... shouting at me that it would take me five years [set a mouse that would cost $300] to stop having fun, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for 15 USD.
How much breath occurs by the big company:
Long before leading the resurrection of Apple, Jobs had foretold that many industrial leaders in his vision would collapse and lose their market share.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copings or printers, and what's next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so society can no longer be more successful.
At that moment, the remains and marketing are already ruling, so the companies are running the people who care about this, while people who care about their own products are evicted from the decision-making process.
The technological genius that has led society to its unshaken position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned literally the entire computer industry.
She could've been ten times bigger than that, could've been Microsoft in the '90s...
Instead of winning, however, they earned a loss.
How does innovation take the form of art:
"A great idea and a great product is still a long journey and a lot of work... and how this great idea develops, so it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to enter a number of compromises - certain things simply electrons, glass, robots or factories do not force.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and put them together...
Finally, it depends on the taste - you try to think of the best things that have ever been created by mankind, and in a certain way you try to put them into what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of breaking the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zooists, historians and conciliaries of the world's best computer experts.
If it wasn't for computers and new technologies, they'd be able to do amazing things in other sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the Health Care Act at the time when their case was dealt with by the court
On the day when the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question whether he accepted an objection against President Obama's Health Care Act, two of his Judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, to attend a solemn dinner sponsored by a law firm that will participate before the court.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges gathered to discuss the proposals submitted.
One of the pending cases was the action brought in by 26 states questioning the radical reprocessing of medical care approved by Congress last year - a law that mobilised conservative activists around the world.
In March, however, 5,5 hours of action is expected, the result of which will further develop the presidential elections planned for 2012 and at the time of the decision being taken will be in full flow.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and endeavour to obtain the rejection of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the Attorney General of the United States under George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies who helped sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner, which has been dealing with conservative legal principles for many years.
Another dinner-sponsored company, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations questioning the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
Dinner took place at the Washington Hotel hours after the court debate on the case.
He took part in it, other than others, also Mitch McConnell, the prime representative of the Republicans in the Senate, and confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And the introduction of guests?
It is not new: This pair of judges have been participating in the Federal Society's actions for years.
And it certainly isn't about anything that would be contrary to ethical rules.
In fact, these judges are exempt from complying with the principles of conduct which are subject to lower federal judges.
If it were not, it would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which says that "the judge may participate in events that are precisely related and other organisations organise for the purpose of obtaining funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honest guest, nor be included in the action programme."
Nevertheless, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms acting in the case, as well as companies with enormous financial interest in this case, was rich enough to alarm the activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claim of several judges that the Supreme Court is acting in accordance with the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Caesar.
"The judges have been drinking and having dinner at the benefit of the social union together with legal representatives waiting to discuss their case before the court."
Their presence and assistance in the acquisition of funds through this action undermines the feet by all claims of inadmissibility, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed only a great deal of insight towards their critics and pointed out that they also combined their judicial duties with group actions, such as the Federal Society.
Thomas's wife Ginni is a highly built conservative activist.
Furthermore, consumers argue that the ethical problem is primarily with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scala with Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor for President Obama's reign when the first objections against the law appeared before the court.
The Kagan critics are pushing her to terminate her involvement in the case, claiming that she was fighting as much for the law as she could now be uninvited.
Kagan didn't mean she was gonna quit.
Boeing has received a record order for jet aircraft worth USD 18 billion
The Emirates Aerollies order 50 dual jet aircraft Boeing 777 with the possibility of purchasing 20 others.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which more than 1 billion USD is available.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if the company is the aircraft manufacturer of the Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aeroplanes together makes the record $118 billion, it is something else.
It is equally important to report from where Boeing obtained the contract: The Middle East, an increasing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to the predictions issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need $2 520 aircraft worth USD 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced her biggest order on the weekend in history, as regards the dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-currency Boeings 777.
The sensational contract came from the Emirates airline based in Dubai.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that airlines have the opportunity to purchase another 20 aircraft, which would make the total value of the contract possible to reach $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that the Oran Air airlines ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also known as Dreamliner, which boast significantly better fuel consumption and passengers' equipment.
The total price of these six aeroplanes exceeds USD 1 billion.
"One of the excellent news for the entire company Boeing," said Neal Dihora, analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many Middle East airlines belong to those nations that weigh oil.
This means that they not only have money to pay the aircraft, but an increase in fuel prices - mostly damaging airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - it is not so decisive because the country itself makes more money on higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines that they could stack or postpone aircraft orders due to fuel price increases, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The Emirates airline contract strengthens Boeing’s leading position on the aircraft market with a wide hull and brings Airbus SAS to the narrow companies that wanted to try to disrupt Boeing’s dominant A350 model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus’s representatives announced that the first flight of their largest aircraft A350, which is a direct competitor of 777-300ER.
Therefore, the manufacturer took time to deliver more power to the machines.
Boeing Co's price rose by 1.5% to 67.94 USD.
The Mexican President's sister was apparently defeated in the Michocian elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Valleion, from PRI, helped chase the governor's chair to drugkers.
Sister Felipe Calderon appears to have lost her post in the violent state elections on the occasion of the governor in Michoacán. On Monday, she later declared that one of her opponents helped drug traffickers to win.
Preliminary results have been attributed to leadership in the governorial elections of the West State to Faust Vallele by the Institute Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The threats of members of organized crime to the whole electoral process and, in particular, until the end of the elections itself, are alarming not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luis Maria Calderon in an interview for the radio day after Sunday elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our members of the public opinion poll group... they confiscated electoral urns, built roadblocks... and let people vote for PRI's order.
The PRI Party ruled in Mexico seven decades until 2000, when the Presidency had lost it.
However, it plans to return quickly to power and victory in the elections in Mikoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes that it will win even in July in the presidential elections.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who was just close one day before the election.
Calderon, the candidate for the conservative side of her brother National Action Party, or the PAN, refused to accept Valledon as a winner.
The third has been placed by Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-hand side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which until now has been controlled by the governor's office. For the disputed and depraved side, the presidential election in 2012 is a very unfortunate loss.
Aureoles also refused to recognise preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state named Morelia, refuses any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to recognise the results.
Mikoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
This is the home state of President Calderon, and it was in Michoacán in December 2006 that he started a military fight against traffickers.
But violence persisted.
The mayor of the PAN, Entrant of Luisa Marie Calderon, was murdered just one week before the election and many election candidates resigned from fear.
However, although the results of the elections in Michoacán look to the side of PRI any way, the victory of the party will help win a new impulse.
The expected representative of the PRI party in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated from Wahington Vallej and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraging in view of the coming year."
Bank ADB calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Bank of Asiaan Development Bank invited India and China to be ready to help save the Eurozone before its severe debt crisis, otherwise it could result in a global decline in the global economy, which would have a negative impact on the growth of the economy in Asia.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of ADB, based in Manila, said that two rapidly growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help quickly restore the monetary block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned against the fact that the Bric States [Brazil, Russia, India, China] all European difficulties follow the 'too uninterrupted' and said that Asian financial assistance in combination with European leadership and means will help to prevent the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is fit," said the Financial Times during the interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but he is certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been badly tested for several months with a severe debt crisis.
In recent days Italy's borrowing costs have been rising dangerously, and both Italy and Greece's presidents have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe raised concerns about bringing the global economy back into recession, and it began to call for new emerging front economies to join and help Eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag foretold that all Asian aid would be directed through the IMF, but noted that mutual assistance - such as the purchase of bonds to the Fund for financial assistance to the European Union, an institution for European financial stability - would provide greater negotiating opportunities for Asian partners of European countries.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do what she can to help the Eurozone, because her own economy now suffers from a drop in export and dry out the presence of foreign capital.
"No one wants Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an alternative, it's a tough fact, because how else could we find a job for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to explain the help to Europe 1.2 billion citizens of India, when 800 million of them live from $2 or less per day.
"They could find that the Greeks are retired in 50 and are enjoying holidays on the beaches, which would probably be hard to explain," he observed.
Lee Howell, Director General of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well paid employment for many Greek citizens in badly managed and loss sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis could be a "safe domino effect".
The Bank's forecast that between 2011/2012 and 7.5% of economic growth is now facing a "decline risk" because of the European threat.
He declared that vulnerable emerging markets had to create "non-predictable spending plans" to protect them from the downturn and a significant outflow of capital from their economy.
Warnings from the Pentagon regarding possible cuts in the area of defence
The Minister of Defence Leon Panetta, on Monday in Congress, put a good hand under the boiler when he warned that the overruning automatic cuts in the budget could jeopardise national security and create a financial chain reaction starting in the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend USD 450 billion cut over the next ten years, but it is now afraid to reduce by another 600 billion dollars if Congress fails to conclude an spending agreement.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire department," wrote Panetta in a letter to Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress’s inability to reach an agreement on the budget and hence the so-called halt will result in a 23% flat-rate decline and halt many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used this reckless way, it will not be possible to make most of our construction or marine projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of the building or boats. Moreover, there could be serious damage to other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian workers, and since it is intended to cut through so quickly, we will also have to almost certainly send civilians to a forced holiday so that we can meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake with faith those who take care of our army and seriously harm its readiness."
Finally, cuts will be affected by combat troops, Mr Panetta announced.
"Even though the accounts for financing possible war operations are not affected directly by this settlement, there will be negatively affected by major changes in other accounts," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contractual staff, resulting in delays in negotiated contracts supporting our people's war efforts."
"The state of paid employees will be reduced, including late payments to suppliers and subsequent violations of legal and political support."
Both Senators of Panetta wrote back ten days ago asking for details of possible impact on automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of the intermissions to the Ministry of Defense could result in a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a global military power."
"We are strictly against this harsh measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"It's not a conclusion we could live with, and we certainly don't want to sign under it."
"The cuts involved are a threat to the United States' national security, which we should not allow."
"We will first see whether Panetta's letter and fresh warning will increase the pressure on Congress's approved budget and strengthen the votes calling to leave the Pentagon out of the list of deleted areas.
Panetta has recently been increasingly open in talks about potential cuts, although he himself has gone to his high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience approving budgets in the Congress and White House, so he knew he was being launched into a tough fight.
At a press conference held a minute week, the Minister of Defense indicated a brief picture of what his resort might expect - the shell of the army, but within which the core will be missing.
"He'll be like a boat without sailors."
"He'll be like a non-municipal brigade."
"He'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of casinos, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who could complete the mission," said Panetta at the beginning of the speech in the Pentagon.
"He will be a unit without morality, unprepared, and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In the Annex, delivered with a letter to McCain and Graham Panetta specify how the reduction will result from "significant operational risks: late reaction to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions on the possibility of privileges and deployment worldwide; anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the biggest defence projects could be expected to end, including those already tested, as well as those that are only in the early stages of planning.
For example, there was a project of an aircraft F35, a planned new bomber, a ballistic submarine of a new generation, a new coastal combat ship and a new ground combat vehicle that the army and marine corps wanted to replace the Humvee.
By stopping further development and testing of the aircraft F35 would save over the next 10 years 80 billion dollars, but its advocates claim that it is a necessary further step in improving the army that needs to be tackled by the country with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
The summer view of recent headlines suggests how serious and obvious lies and lying in everyday life are.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his full hands on the charge that he sexually harassed several women - both sides claim that the other side is lying.
The administrators at Penn State University were charged with perjury testimony trying to hide records of the fact that a homely football coach sexually assaulted a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling American President Barrack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
A lie could destroy the entire career and reduce the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately reversed by unquestionable evidence.
Former President John Edwards was accused of using his campaign finance to try to hide his marriage.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that took off around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period on his sexual move with Monica Lewinsky.
It's all about cheating at school and the university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers to make them look good in their own reports.
Mentorians who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud is acceptable.
How many frauds do we meet?
Studies show that on one day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times during the first ten minutes of the first meeting in life.
Determining lies, or "disposing lies", is the necessary skill that everyone should develop for personal or work reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, Charade, when a person screams, "I have you." The expansion of deception is a serious industry of science working with scientific data collected during the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the research results is that most of the old myths about lies have been reversed.
The liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're suffocating, moaning, reddening, or getting crazy.
But do not take it out of the fact that it is somehow difficult to observe and reveal.
The well-trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from the branch structure, minor expressions in the face, the way questions are made and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from an extensive and developing sector of lie recognition, and it is clear that detection of deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and in today's difficult world can help you very much - especially if your work involves hiring, organising interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them tell in security, guide their emotions and intuitively realize how the other side adopts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts that men spend more "sembling" lies, while women say more lies "oriented to others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that women's people lie less often to their partners than free people (the lies they say, are usually "immoral").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the entity.
It's called "starting observation."
He will have later findings with which to compare.
Note the possession of the body of the body, his laughter, his work with the voice.
You should know if someone normally keeps knocking your feet so that you don't wrongly accuse him of lying just because he starts knocking his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to identify the clusters of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But take it only as warning signals, not as evidence of lies.
People making a lie can stop moving the upper half of the body, when they try to remember their fictional story, they can turn their tops to the door, bend towards the east, significantly change the possession of the body, or show a "relief after the end of the conversation" - excessive relief breath and change the position when it is difficult to confess behind them.
People interviewing people often give a false signal that there's an interview at the end, just to see how the relief will look after it's over.
Also feel the language of the subject.
There's a great story about how Scott Peterson once denied himself and used last time when he claimed that his murdered woman was alive, which ran a national search for her body.
The prodigal individuals may also express themselves: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or the difficult question will repeat the whole thing.
The most common verbal signs are only very tiny.
Someone can use a lot of "migrant tongue" when it answers the difficult question: "Well, to tell the truth... from what I know... in my best knowledge."
In such an answer, we don't get to know too many facts, and often it's another warning signal.
There is no magic to reveal every lie, but it is possible to develop the skills that a lie can be sent out.
By using these skills, one will have a greater chance of not flying a liar and a fraud in his own personal and work.
The controversial plan for the oil pipeline construction will be redirected after the threat of postponement of approval by the U.S. government appears
A few days after Obama’s government threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipe from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - thus sending its unions against them, but calming down the environmentalists - the company with the construction of the pipeline to the mayor announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that they could get things back in motion.
TransCanada announced Monday evening that it would move the planned route of the Sandhills pipe from the ecologically sensitive area in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project would be approved as well.
The company notified this decision at a press conference at the seat of the Nebraska Government.
TransCanada Alex Porbax claims that the company is convinced that eventually the construction of the pipeline will be approved, although it will lead to a different route.
This notification came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it would postpone the decision on a federal permit of a project, from which it would not conduct studies of possible replacement routes, which could be possible not to intervene in the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the watery layers of Ogalla, a vast underground water supply facility.
"This is really a move forward," said Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
The new ecological assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably postpone any decision until 2013, i.e. one year after the elections next year, but the authorities refuse to play a political role in the decision.
Obama described the decision in a written statement last week as a request from the Foreign Ministry and expressed his support.
The 1 700 miles long pipe will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From Albert's province to the refinery in Texas, I eat 700 000 barrels of oil every day.
That way, six states will have to go through.
This project totally hates environmentalists, but it is loved by work platoons, which estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipeline.
However, the legislators in Nebraska stood up against this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and the watery Ogalla layer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact studies ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but the source from the energy industry said that the inspector General of the Ministry ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study and focused mainly on two questions.
Once it was whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, was not presented in a conflict of interest programme.
Furthermore, whether the company which was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBell is accused of being thrown away by the bats
The New York family claims that Patti LaBelle's singer was furiously barring into their Manhattan house and scaring their daughter so that she threw up her fear.
The performance of "Lady Marmalade" hit 18 months old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "the change of personality, sleep disorder" and "the increased fear of strangers," says her family in a lawsuit brought to Manhattan's Supreme Court.
On November 10th last year, the stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve was going for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk set up the car, Roseanna Monk got the luggage down to the village of their house in the Riverside Boulevard with her and Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a second, and she put the baby away for a second.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "You know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to pick her up."
LaBell's pregnant woman was irritating.
"The aggressive tone said, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She got angry, and she started talking dirty, and she shouted out the dirtyest words...
She had a bottle of water on her, and she started to give me water.
He says Genevieve got a hysteric seizure.
"I told that woman, "Look what you did to my daughter." said the mother of the child.
LaBelle had her mother, who was still in her arms, Genevieve - cast and had to stop her escort, who then dragged her into a waiting car, told Roseanna Monk.
In the meantime, the daughter screamed so much when she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter requesting apologies from LaBelle, but no answers were received.
The lawyer and speaker of LaBelle's singers do not respond to our phone calls to express themselves to the whole case.
The complaint calls for an undeserved compensation, but the family attorney, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken free of charge and that the family plans to devote all the money spent to the charity organization devoted to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her initiation," Davis said.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a teacher from a school holding in the arms of a 18-month-old child."
The climate deficit has turned the economy down
During the first year of the government, Maria Lópeze Valdez increased unemployment in Sinaloa and inconsistencies, decreased foreign investment and the economy.
This is the first year of the government of Maria Lópeze Valdeze, which itself is called the Government of Change. This government brought great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year, there was no growth and even a decline in the main economic development indicators.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the growth potential of the state economy, have the conscience of reducing economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In agriculture, there was a historical decline of 31.16%, which affected the dynamics and other economic sectors.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded at 582,835 hectares of divided land, of which 78,03% were completely destroyed and partial damage was detected for the remaining 21,07%.
Economic activity decreases until November caused a steady rise in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and geography, unemployment rates in the country increased to 5.28% during the first three quarters. Between January and March 55,053 inhabitants of the Sinaloa state were not employed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August, average unemployment continued to reach 6.19%, which represents approximately 74,000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
More factors may be found for unemployment during the year in the State of Sinaloa. According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of UAS, an increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, on the basis of the steps taken at public policy level.
"We are witnessing an increasing unemployment that is linked to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the limitation of resources due to the legislation approved by the Congress in the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally power dollars, it is not easy for them to make, invest them or use them for something," he stressed.
Stop migration
López Cervantes stated that demographic factor is also involved in the unemployment increase.
"The number of people who go abroad to the United States has fallen, however, because of the difficult entry and then because, even though these people are abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job, so people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment grows," he said.
Immunity
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also aggravated because of the growing inconsistencies that prevail in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60%8% of the employed people in the state are working without taking benefits of social security management.
More features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and infertility. In this administrative area, the lowest wages from all over the country, as reported by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly intake of workers in the State of Sinaloa was by September 5, 352 pesetas, deep below the national average, moving to 7,375 pesetas.
Shortening of direct foreign investment
Together with the decline in economic activity and unemployment growth, the most significant decline in direct foreign investment has also been recorded in 2011 for the past 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, EUR 630 697 has been direct foreign investment, which represents a fall of $87.74% compared to USD 5 143 312 for the same period of the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government mentions investments of 17 280 million peset per year, mainly towards service companies.
Debt
In relation to the scenario of the decline in the economy, the Government of that State asked the State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso. It would be intended for investments in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas with a view to reinvigorating the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of 2 600 million peso.
Responses
According to business representatives, the first year of government, Maria Lópeze Valdés pointed to the lack of government management capabilities.
Mr Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the National Chamber of Transforming Industry, stated that in 2011 there was no reconciliation of the will of each sector, including the Government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really small during this year. We have to work intensively to get back the land we lost this year. In 2012 we need to double our efforts, lacked harmonisation of efforts for all and especially the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let us hope that next year will be much better", he said.
The slowness of the economy
Loredo López said that events like the storms stopped the state economy and reduced its growth and growth at the start of the year.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including clouds. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not quickly remember in order to restore the dynamism that would enable an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year, we were deeply below expected forecasts," he said.
Redefined Mission
According to Teodora Salazar Uriarte, President of the Gulf Confederation of Mexico in Sinaloa, state needs to be pushed for more productive activities.
We believe that we need to prepare a long-term plan in which the goals and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important to mobilise all the potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
A work that is ahead of us
President Copramex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that would be better managed by the Government's efforts.
"Of course, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, there has been some progress in economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term plan", he said.
He said that current administration has shown progress in terms of public policy leadership.
"There are elements that allow the government to say that it is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work before us," he said.
Convicted in 8 kg marijuana
The citizen of Navolo was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fines for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The U.S. Attorney General informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuel Sandoval. He was convicted for the crime of health threats, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican forces on 7 June 2010 at a walk in Cipriano Valdez, across from station 80 in the district of El Castillo, Navolo.
Dearer was in a truck with a pick up white colors. In a car in a shelf he had a black bag and a small backpack on the passenger seat. Soldiers found 8 kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remains at the disposal of the General Court and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the implementation of the legal effects of the offences.
Debt contributions to projects
Social projects that form part of programmes such as Hábitat, the rescue of public places and 3x1 for migrants face the danger that they will not be touched to the end or that they will be very late due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development stated that if construction works had been ahead, it is now threatened that the government will not be able to provide adequate supplies that require more than 11 million peso for three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million peso. The state is 25%. By this time the labour resources were supplied only by the Federation and the city; therefore, it is possible that projects will be delayed in the implementation of projects.
"They are to secure almost 12 million, and although one year is already moving to the end, we have not received anything at all. And even though in July we had to get a part," he said. "To not waste time, projects we started and continue very badly, but we lack money."
He said that last year, the State did not fill in the relevant supplies for Jesús Aguilara Padilla's administration, and therefore at the beginning of the new period, the city had to ask for a loan so that it could pay more than 7 million that the state administration had not given them.
"The thing that happened to us in the previous six years was because the state had no economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. To get to the programs mentioned this year, we had to obtain the means to cover what was not completed by the State," explained.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the public authorities regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that Armand Villarreal, Secretary of Administration and Finance had been sent to speed up the proceedings and the corresponding percentage had arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we haven't even got a peso yet."
The Court of Justice approves the 'end of analogue broadcasting' in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of State (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Parliamentary Chamber against the Presidious Decree, which wanted to accelerate the so-called 'externation of analogue signals' and to implement it instead of 2021 in 2015.
The minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued a decree that specified the individual steps leading to the transition to the digital television on earth.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was rejected, and that is because a qualified majority of eight votes needed for the court to express itself as to the constitutional or inconsistencies of the said decree, which thus remains valid.
The proposal for a judgment drawn up by Mr Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility to declare a decree inconsistencies, since the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter that is reserved by the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in order to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all actions described in it leading to the transition to digitisation.
The Ministerial meeting also decided to refuse the action brought by the Parliamentary House without entering into a discussion on the proposal, which was also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that it does not identify with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that federal exekutiva cannot be structured through the general standards of measures to prepare public administration.
"I do not think that, even if she did, this would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is bound by a federal executive with a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of analogue digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is associated with better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It is thought that it would be necessary to separate the benefits from digitisation, which requires a decision on public interest, because digitisation does not only have a technical dimension, but "it also affects economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these questions "required the operation of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state, include a number of competences which the Constitution entrusts to the Government."
He recalled that many countries around the world have already concluded the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, even though they have been available to highly specialized technical authorities.
He pointed out that it was impossible for the government to give an unconsolid decree, which, to some extent, interferes with the terms of competence of the Congress, to introduce in the area of administration compliance with laws prepared by legislative powers.
In Mikoacan, they analyze the possibility of adding "voice by voice"
According to the information published by the EP, the difference between the first and second place in the Governor's elections is less than 27 percent. 879 votes of 6074 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
The possibility of the "voice by voice" census appeared in the elections in Michoacán this year, where, in line with the information published by the Program of preliminary electoral results (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the Governor's elections is less than 27 percent, yet the votes of 879 from the total 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, President General Council of the Election Institute in Mikoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that a few days ago, 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As it will be recalled, Michoacán officially did not confirm his political constitution nor his State electoral code or the Law on electoral justice. The State Congress approved reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force during this election period and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel forgot their publication within the set time limit in the Official State Gazette with any objections against them.
On 9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative powers and declared the voice of the Head of State in the matter of constitutional reforms for 'unlawable and illegal' because it has no right to 'ani to approve or veto'.
On the question of the possibility of adding 'voice by voice' to María de los Ángeles Llanderal, she replied that, thanks to the approval of the appropriate measures, the General Council of IEM will be able to carry out both the partial and the overall census by the local electoral authority.
In this way a partial number of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible to perform under the following conditions: electoral results do not agree; there is no registration of votes and calculations in the relevant box or does not have it; or if there have been errors and obvious violation of electoral results.
In addition, the overall recalculation of votes in all elections will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; whenever there is a express request from the representative of the party at the beginning of the session and/or the coalition proposed by the candidate in the second place.
The overall recalculation of votes will also be possible if, after the correct reading, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and also whenever there is a explicit request from the political party whose candidate has ended in second place. In such a case, there will be the elimination of electoral packages for which partial censuses have been made.
It should be noted that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where the difference between the first and second place is less than 0,16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountains, confirmed by the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday to Saltilla, his hometown, and during the Monday there will be a ceremony and a surprise Mass.
According to the family, it was his last desire for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountains.
After the highest honors occurred in the accident, the family Bacio Cortése returned to Coahuila's capital on board the Mexican air force plane. The family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the Colonel's ashes arrived in the chapel located at the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where the family and friends also arrived.
At 5:30 a.m., a farewell took place at the Saltillo Technology Institute, which was organized by his former high school students, and members of the American football team, who were Felipe Baticio at the time of preparations for graduation also a member.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his desire was for his ashes to be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé. This is what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, pilot's sister.
According to her, the Colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young and joined the Colegio del Aire Aire Aire Aire in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he was even driving a truck, but he always went to his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávil Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "a very good man came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapohn to his uncle's promotion, so he is convinced that he died in what he liked most in his life: plane management.
They gave him one last goodbye.
With Felip Bacio Cortés, Colonel of Mexican Air Forces, we said goodbye to all the honors that came to him to surrender Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and government, the Mexican Army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, leaders and students of the Saltillo Technology School, where he studied in 1985 and where he disappeared both in study and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the last days after the helicopter he was driving, and on board was also the secretary of government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and another six people, all officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of the Saltille family Bacio Cortése (responsible) arrived to be handed over the Mexican air force through funeral service under the direction of Major Jaime Martinez at the court, where the family, his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers gathered in the meantime.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on the ship of Cadereyt NL
A few hours before the findings of the military authorities, 11 people who were detained in this area for crimes related to organised crime presented with the media.
The bodies of three men murdered by shooting into different parts of the body and head were found on an abandoned ship of Cadereta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The track took place on a mile from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the cabin with bezovo-kave fence had been open from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One person was wearing a sports shirt of yellow color and dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes. A person also laid in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters further there was another body dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three of them were facing the ground.
According to the data obtained in places, all three people were likely to be murdered elsewhere because bullets were not found.
Messages addressed by one group of organized crime second were found on the chat fence, as well as a series of bullet trails, both at the building and on the doors.
At Caderete, 11 suspects were arrested.
The secret of the National Defense introduced 11 people, among whom there are also adolescents, who were members of a criminal group who operated mainly in the area of Caderete, who are associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the information published at the first attempt on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, 8 persons were detained and one detained person was released.
Three properties were secured and three cell phones confirmed to be members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
The next raid took place on 12 November at 6 p.m. The military staff were at Rancho Viejo in Cadereita, when he noticed a car without the SPZ and in it two persons.
After the car stopped, they inspected and discovered one rifle, a casing and 18 bullets.
Then, based on these observations, about 14 November, one of the accomplices in La Frauda was arrested. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Teran, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday, a new Italian government will be appointed
The Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce a new government that will face the crisis that the country holds over the failure of economic disaster.
The Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce a new government that will face the crisis that the country is holding over the collapse of the economic disaster and putting the whole euro area in danger.
The President's Palace issued a report in which he announced that Monti, named on Sunday, would meet President Giorgie Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could create a government.
It is expected that he will introduce a government made up of technocratics, although it is not yet clear when the new government takes power.
Monti declared that he would present the results of his talks with the political parties in an attempt to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti explicitly did not say that he would be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of creating government in less than three days, which is at a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has led to an unsustainable level of debt.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Montim, must approve a hard package of austerity measures that require European leaders. Italy will only be able to restore the destroyed credibility.
At Montiho there is a great pressure to hurry. Because of the instability of the markets, the interest on the Italian bonds of BTP with a 10-year maturity of 7 percent, the level where Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian employer organization Confindustria, told journalists after her meeting with Montim: "We said we would support this government very much".
We believe that this government is the last option for Italy to get out of this pressing situation.
Monti’s hope of success was significantly multiplied by the support from PDL Silvia Berlusconi, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are meant to be good results," said Angelina Alphao, the mystery of the midway party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant, because up to this point, many of its members stood up against the government with the technocratic majority, which is set up by Monti.
Support to Parliament
The new Monti government must have strong support for Parliament to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti opened negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth organisations and women on Monday.
The round of negotiations ends on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed President of Napolitan on Sunday, which enabled a very rapid procedure in response to the crisis.
After a short decline from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi will give a demise, the interest of Italian bonds returned to critical borders and react to the uncertainty of whether the new Prime Minister will reap success.
To save Italy, with a public debt of €1.8 trillion, would be beyond the possibilities of the current financial reserves of the euro area.
Monti said that his government should keep up to the next elections planned for 2013, despite the general forecasts that claim that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms and then declare early elections.
Monti said that he would like to include policies in his cabin, but the large parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to bring Italy out of difficulties in which the country has come to because of financial pressure.
Political resources have indicated that bilateral mistrust and disapproval between the parties complicate the attempt to incorporate into governments and political personalities.
Spaniards take part in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Out of 22 Spanish football players, ten exceed 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of 22 called players has reached the number of 50 matches.
Huge contrast on the Costa Rica side if we compare 22 players in both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While masters of the world and Europe, the number one monthly FIFA rating, have on their end a wide range of inter-receivers of Class A, Costa Rica has only a defenseman Michael Uman, who has played 50 international matches.
This figure reached last Friday at the match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández stadium.
Spanish football players who play at the Stunning Stars and the Powerful Clubs of the First League of England maintain an intense activity on league championships and home cups and high-level matches within European Cups as Champions League.
We also need to add experience from the national Spanish team in complicated elimination matches to the European and world championship.
Costa Ricars, on the contrary, have very limited possibilities for foreign struggles in the area. There is, for example, a Concacf that is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish representations has on its end the goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches last Saturday before England (the 0-1 loss in London).
Casillas comes up today against Costa Rica and gets a new record for Spain - 127 international games.
Xavi Hernández, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 matches at its end.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA together with other Spanish players who had hundreds of matches at their end. Among them the already mentioned Zubizarret with 126 and middle attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol also approached the stables with 97 matches.
They follow Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres s 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inista with 62; Cesc Fabregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and close to Michael Uman, the left wing of Júnior Dieaz moves with 48 matches and the goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz becomes 45.
Furthermore, only 5 exceeded 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeif with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches costs Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games, and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Vestor Bolívar has only one, and Oelman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shot of Spain is David Villa with 50 goals and followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rica side he has the most hits of Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Kvinte incorporated the country into his tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence
"Cest on Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group is ready next Sunday to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium.
We have waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the possibility to play on Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This is what the bassist and founding member of Jeff Ament spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20.
This day comes from 19:30 at the National Stadium together with the Angelic Group The X and the National musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an example of a conversation that can be found on La Nación's website.
For your Costa Rica supporters it's a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The journey to Costa Rica is also our dream, which becomes reality.
In South and Central America, we are hardly twice and experience has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we can spend a few days here.
So we are delighted to bring you our music.
I ask, because they literally love the group here, fans experience these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you say to your most brilliant supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry it took us so long.
Some people talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that make you more pressure?
Some of the biggest shows we've shown in the last 21 years have been built in the horizon for several weeks.
We've performed some great shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that's what we got into the form of a concert at Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to this concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like jungles, for both activities is Costa Rica the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and her waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surf buddies and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends are going surf on Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. They're the best surfing sites, so we've learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no limitations on what we can't do.
We'll try to show the best show with a variety of songs. We'll try to play some songs from every album and introduce our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone loves other songs, which is why it's hard to choose which songs we will play every night.
When we have two three songs we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we'll remember why we liked them so much and maybe we've forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people as well.
This tour you celebrate 20 years of art track.
If you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, I'm sure you do.
First of all, I don't think that any of us could imagine staying in one of the great rock groups and staying in it for more than 20 years, that sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given and we realize that we can continue to play together.
We like each other and we like to make music.
We're lucky to be able to look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't get better.
What meant to you that you were an important part of the Grunge genre?
It was always an honor for us to be part of this group, in which they are represented by the very great people.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when the movement comes out of a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, a group will arise in the city, but it is much less common to emerge from one city at once five to ten groups.
We're proud of it, and we're honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play with some of them.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are fortunate that they are all our friends and we are honored that we can be part of this movement that was created in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after those years.
Yes, we four have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is already a long time since the band's usual duration.
I think first of all, we're all lucky that we're still in this world, and secondly, it's the fact that we're always interested in each other.
We're all close friends, and that's why we've been able to open up musical paths that leave every sufficient freedom to experiment on our own.
We both believe in each other, appreciate the music of the other, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to a word was not easy. However, thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find your balance?
As we grew, it was increasingly easier to find a balance.
We try not to ride too much on tour because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you'll remember that you have music and what you gave her, respect it, and you can't get carried away by being famous, rock stars.
How do you remember the next project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote great songs and at first it was something spectacular.
We had three years of existence as a band, and we never released any album until Andy died (Andrew Woods).
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at pictures, I remember Andy, as incredible as I was laughing with him. It was always a joy to work with him, to laugh, to talk about music or football and many more.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her very much.
The National Band Las Robertas will be charged to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it as a surprise?
Yes, the production has sent us videos with several designs and we liked this group most. Therefore, we are curious what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very fun.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
It's Eda Vedder's question, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing to think about it.
Who affects you as a bass player?
Lots of people.
I'm the first to be attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many that I could talk all night about bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge, though she's not in style anymore?
I think we've always felt easy to separate ourselves from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I imagine groups that I referred to as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that have been created at the same time. And if music is valid today, it's something great, because it's music that is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney today playing better music than ever before.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly cloudy character and now it's more positive.
What is behind this change?
This is interesting because I feel that there are a few songs in the new album that are easier to read, but there are also songs such as The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered to be very mutilating, although they can sound positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them, I cried, and they're very deep dark.
I think that when you grow up and you have trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or boyfriend, these things will affect your art and your music, and these two songs represent this to me.
I also think that you can be a happy person, and yet you can make a murmur music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at a public hospital, where he will be tested for the muscle loss he suffers in the lower limbs, informed by his treating physician.
72 years old Fujimori, who is serving the sentence of 25 years of freedom for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he was operated four times and already have doctors under control.
Member of Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his doctor, said to the Canal N television station that Fujimori will perform tests within three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, where they should find out why he is hurt and why he loses his strength in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that, in his opinion, Fujimori could have mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former President himself himself does not want grace because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times because of his tongue cancer, he dropped 18 kilograms, and other nerds as heavy erosion gastritis, cysts on his leg, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in his legs, named the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving punishment since September 2007 at the National Directorate for Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people who killed the murdering army squad working illegally in the first years of his government.
Mujica to visit Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation led by the Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start on Tuesday's visit to Mexico. Its aim is to expand trade between the two nations and touch the political issues of the region.
Mujica meets her Mexican counterpart, Felip Calderón. It is the most important meeting of large visits to a full meeting with representatives of politics, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political affairs between the two countries", published the Uruguayan presidential office on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Caldejs to support Uruguay in a dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy assigned the South American country to a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in Cannes, France.
In his speech Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens will be removed from the international community. This declaration raised a negative opinion from Uruguay and a consultation of the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has been President of the G20 since November. G20 is a group of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. The Latin American country has since January this year signed an information exchange agreement to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguay government has sought to specify fiscal exchange agreements with a view to getting out of the 'black list' of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to which countries have not implemented all the required international tax cooperation standards.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have since 2004 concluded the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to strengthen the exchange of goods between both countries.
The bearded installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
The Super Mario has been struggling for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the Bowser villain, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to all shops around the world, was already made from the beginning to use all the characteristics that offer the portable Nintendo 3DS console that allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character that has to say how the stereoscopy should work without glasses", said the press worker, Nintendo, Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game developed specifically for this medium", because until this moment successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The spokesperson Nintendo said that besides the 3D film, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and smooth lot.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "the simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once this level is overcome, you can run into the second round at the levels of the games that are more demanding this time.
In addition, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome various challenges and to "be independent of optical fraud".
This new Super Maria entry in 3D also presupposes returning characters to a portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this videogame Nintendo plays into the notes to those who are saga watching and repeating successful formulas from previous parts. It is that the installer of a bearded man will have to go through dangerously dominated platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in motions, in the vicinity, in disguises and also among the enemies, he also appears "playful" Luigi.
Colom approved Portilla's release to the United States
On Tuesday, the President of Álvaro Colom announced that he took steps in the issue of the former President Alfons Portilla, who is to be responsible in the United States for the purpose of washing 70 million US dollars.
This is the end of a process aimed at Guatemala answering at the request of the Northern Country which requires Portilla to be issued in order to be able to judge it.
At the Colom press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of justice and executive power and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered the release.
He assured that, during his mandate, he did not interfere with judicial decisions and permitted all the issues that had been made to him on the table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will be issued for murder and severe injury to health and Edgar Estrada Morales and more estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's step means a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to lead the process against the former President who ruled between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and respect for human rights will be guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent of embezzlement 120 million at the Ministry of Defence at the time of his presidency, before the release, but the Public Ministry appealed and returned the case to the game.
Trinity helped 6,000 young people in a state of danger
The organization was created to help children without education, so that they would not be found on the edge of the society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of an organization of social support to Trinity is very important: 6,000 young people, who have threatened social exclusion, have been helped. The organization has been helping them overcome the difficult situation for 25 years.
To this end, hundreds of jobs have to be added, obtained for this social group.
Last anniversary also served to present a balance sheet in the official act held in former production premises of Fabra and Coats factory, which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinikov was founded in Trinity Vella in 1986 to help young people with low education, without work, facing drug addiction or in situations where they could fall into social exclusion.
Last night's meeting in Sant Andrea attended a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association in the past 25 years.
A varied political representation, at the time of election, showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by Trinity.
Together with President Generalit, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist guidance counselor for education, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and Contemporary Environmental-Social Councillor Ricard Goma participated.
Also, current consultants for Social welfare and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and CEO of Social Labour at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, joined the Grand Room of Fabra and Coats.
Mas said that Trinity was founded in a very difficult time and that today's time also provided many obstacles, but he added that the work that the association had brought to this day is a good basis.
The President said Trinity as an example of how to combat adverse circumstances and how to deliver courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work it is doing, nothing new," he said.
There was a removal of the taken house where the giant parties were held
The aliens owned 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 ransomers left the house yesterday at noon, without resisting
All of this suggests that the nightmares that the neighbors from number 51 on the Balmes street are finally at the end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, which they illegally occupied, and where they organized the giant parties that built the neighbors.
After the operation, the lock was replaced on the doors to prevent recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," said the administrator.
The buyers who took 11 out of 13 apartments in the building - the remaining are inhabited - took away all the electrical and partly and water equipment, also painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage behind them, especially cans for alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties, which lasted up to two days and awakened the other tenants.
There's a discotheque near the building, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europe Press that, for the time that the building was occupied, the sales dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the contractors made her unfair competition because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while 10 are on discotheques.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors due to noise. However, the problems were not caused by visitors to discotheques, but by the residents of the house taken, and especially those who attended the organized parties, whose frequencies and intensity in recent weeks increased, according to the angry inhabitants of the area.
The discotheque owner explained that the problems were so big that they even agreed with the building owner and for nine months forgives her rent.
The city police have also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from their neighbors about the situation.
President of the City Group of the People's Party to the City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, requested that the "building be immediately evicted and that it would end up with the problems of civil co-operation that neighbors suffer and the destruction of the area".
The leader of the people explained that only one floor was taken before the summer, but in the last few months the ransomes got into all the floors of the building and almost all the flats, and there was even theft in one of them.
In this respect, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent with the civil liability consequences that occurred in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 15 o'clock 30 minutes the police got into building 35 on Mont-ral street after the neighbors called her, who saw four people entering the building.
All four were detained immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects met on the occasion of writing the proceedings, which carries more than an array of honoraries.
The 16-gauge city tender opens up again the debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, at the time of the biggest bloom, Corporate Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the government printed several pamphlets to support Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large metropolitan park in Barcelona.
Moreover, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper border of Barcelona. The Catalan capital is one of the few that do not focus on the north-south axis, but up (up) - down (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with savages instead of Yoga bear.
This was the position until September when the town hall declared a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions at the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, is recording the idea of a park.
Either this or someone's trying to place the gate on the field.
So the only question is Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organisational point of view and on the basis of the reflection on the city, this question becomes a central theme of all Barcelona’s architects.
It's just as sharp a topic as the two members of this old casta chosen when they meet in the elevator.
And that's what triggered one of the rare matches between what three barcelon architects and former university professors think.
Miguel Rollan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayon: the selection procedure has merit.
According to Roland, following the question of the party of the Gulf, "it is necessary to also discuss the "Horse side", so the speech of Ildefonse Cerda on green apples was not touched to the end.
"We must be based on the principle that the brightest barcelon park is the beach.
Among other things, his great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", declared an architect for whom the name "bras to Collserola" carries "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them as "like entrances to the park but rather as a definition of the zone where it is possible to operate".
Modol, like Roland and Bayon with experience from the urban world, has qualified the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that hides "some dangers".
Danger arising from "the uncertainty it represents today's public site project" after the experience of the 1980s, which was supposed to sing in the Forum "my weakness".
The first concern is the delimitation of borders, where it should be built.
"A few things to define is to take another step", that is essentially to move forward.
"It is necessary to keep in mind the new urban and planning instruments, since the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM) can cause a real disaster".
If we focus more specifically on the question, Modol considers that the bottom slopes of Collserola can be "think the park", but the barcelonian part is not, for reasons purely topographic.
Modol also reminded that there is already a job by Patronat de Collserola, which "can not end on the garbage grounds", although it welcomes the fact that the town hall offers its grémium that it will hit the project from the "first moment".
And it also understands that the proximity of the mountains and the city is kind of a pass, which allows architects to engage in the debate, but "questions" that it should be this technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all about skills", it adds"), which must be created: "Architekti should be only tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex, because in the selection documents, the global vision Collserola is missing: " 16 selection procedures were published which deal with all the axis of the mountains - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole".
This causes at least him to participate in all 16 selection procedures.
Otherwise, a project of one gate can affect the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gate.
In his view, the City Hall should ensure that the zone located immediately above Ronda de Dalt should ensure the entire length of the equipment zone, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino has pardoned Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal Agent Cadino Red granted grace to the brother of Mayor Monterey in a process in which he was prosecuted for extortion.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after his legal Agent Casino Red has given him mercy before the Second Criminal Court in the district concerned, which discussed the case of blackmail in which the brother of Mayor Monterey was charged.
After an attack on Casino Royale, the owner of Casina Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos on which Manuel Jonas had to ask him to pay for the economic quota to allow city hall in Monterey to allow illegal operation in the bet house.
After a public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office began the criminal prosecution of the brother of the pansic mayor. 2 September, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Ministry's Agency, Number 3 for Property Crimes was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antigua, the capital of the state.
In this place, the following 49 days were left after the second regulations for detention and the Public Ministry's agent returned the possibility to participate or organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyt for suspicion of blackmail by the owners of Casina Red with an amount of one and a half million peso. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with moderate supervision because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in San Nicolás de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he was ordered to arrest the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who declared that, after almost two months of investigation, enough evidence was collected to prove Jonas' fault.
This Monday, the legal Agent, Casina Red, informor Aldo García Gómez, brought to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region.
During the legal meeting, a representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether damage was corrected and who decided to grant grace from his associates, but made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of official file 197/2011, the legal grace of Jonah Larrazababal is granted. In a trial that was held against him, there will be no complaint. Nor is it possible to request compensation or punishment.
After trial with the legal agent around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretton.
The secret of the court, Jorge Yanez, came to the prison in San Nicolás de los Garza, to notify Jonas that he was granted official grace and his case was postponed to the archive.
He also announced that the judge had issued an immediate release order.
The secretary of Dioniso Pérez Jacome introduced details of the air accident in which the secretary of Governor, Francisco Blake, and another seven people died.
The Secretariat for Communication and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the accident investigation, which killed the secretary of the Francisco Blake Mora government and the other seven people, show that the helicopter fell right onto the terrain with full force, without the pilot having a chance to try for forced landing.
At the Press Conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, the Secretary for Communication and Transport, said that before the plane started, the pilot stated that the climate conditions allowed the flight.
"The poems that appear indicate that the unit came several times in contact with the terrain, the wings got involved in the branch of the trees 25 meters from where the unit lost the hull."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons, so it met all the requirements for the transfer of personnel.
In addition, he stated that no components were found on the ground on the basis of an impact investigation.
"When searching, it was found that parts of the aircraft were not found elsewhere, so the plane hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The terrain shows a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secret made sure that at the moment it is important to get as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Mr Gilberto López Meyer, Managing Director of airports and ancillary services, stated that at the time of impact, the helicopter of the President's General Staff was moving at the speed of the trip, and the accident occurred on a softly rising terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a normal flight operation," he said.
At the press conference, SCT Pérez Jácome named six key points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with flight standards, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The message in AICM indicates adequate conditions at take-off, in accordance with that aircraft moving towards the border, between DF and State Mexico the visible layers were clouded at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is probably due to the clouded crew looking for a lower area and greater visibility up to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last entry of the radar helicopter match, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of flight trajectories prior to impact.
Dispersal of aircraft residue in restricted territory:
The information we have currently available allows us to assume that the impact has occurred on a straight line and on the side.
The drawing of the dissipation of the residues of the aircraft suggests that at the time of impact on the mainland, the helicopter was a complete.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the site of disaster to testify that there was an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been some contact with the mainland.
During the field work were found the remains of an aircraft up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is considered, the height of the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show the images that probably broke along the mentioned route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter could have gotten into contact with the countries in several places.
After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, in the territory of which is more extensive than the area of detection, no remains of helicopter were found, which strengthens the assumption that the impact occurred in a state where the helicopter was even more continuous.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has launched a Gene Research that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for the obesity of children and adolescents. Research is carried out with support from IPN experts
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that he was conducting research to detect a gene causing obesity in children and young people. The research called "Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents" will allow for overweight results.
In the report, Head of Biochemistry Medical Unit of the International Hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team composed of doctors, sisters, nutrition experts and social workers was established.
This team is based on support for specialists and students of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Research Centre and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
Involved in research, a wide public with or without permission can also be involved. People can come to IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where every sobor has been conducted since 8 hours by juvenile tests.
He stressed that research began at the Cuauhtémo Sport Centre (Mexico State) and that since October 8, this activity was also carried out at the Niehualcóyolt Sport Centre (the Mexican State East).
As soon as data are received from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue with the Independencia Sport Centre (other than the Federal District) and in the Morelos Sports Centre (northly from the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to trace on Mexican children and young people risk factors and thus prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of diabetes celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim was to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of inherited diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney insufficiency.
He specified that each Saturday with all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, height, belt circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulins are determined, and genes are tested (gens are identified that are involved in the formation of children’s obesity).
Cruz López said that this research reflects the concern of healthcare professionals over the alarming rise in child weight.
'A healthy survey carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years only boys experienced an increase in obesity of 77% and 47% in girls. The dramatic increase also occurred in the case of overweight, he introduced an IMSS expert.
He said that one of the reasons for finding indicators is that the population of the country differs from other populations in their genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in genes that are responsible for the formation of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity are commonly explained as inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants lies in the fact that they will receive a total assessment of the situation of children, thereby determining whether they have any known overweight or obesity.
He pointed out that even the presence of dark-coloured (acantosis) lines on the neck and foreclosure indicates that the individual would suffer from metabolic problems and pre-cushion conditions.
The information is confidential so far, the doctors transmit it in writing to their parents and explain to them all the measurements and changes in the lifestyle that must be made to avoid their children’s illness.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedating way of life that represents a lack of daily physical activity, a daily sitting before television and the use of means of transport rather than a short distance walk.
The overweight also causes large calorie intakes, this is greater consumption of chilled drinks, hydrohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic burden that is covered by this research.
There won't be no tarmacs in the asphalt from UNAM.
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the Chemical Faculty of UNAM creates modified asphalt with polymers, thus creating a mixture of better functionality, independent of climate conditions and temperature
If it were to be properly handled, it would not have been necessary to correct nearly 200,000 exchanges after each rainy period in the Metropolitan Region of Valle de México, to warn Rafael Herrera Najera, a scientist from the Chemical Faculty (FQ) of UNAM, who also added that if construction and maintenance of asphalt pavements were adequate, there would be a significant reduction of requirements, or could even be completely eliminated.
In his lecture, the technological cause of exhausts carried out by chemistry during the International Year has announced that the laboratory under his guidance is developing modified asphalt with polymers, thereby creating a mixture having similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time increased mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country. It would improve functionality and reduce the creation of exhausts.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is the grouping of hydrocarbons, molecules with large molecular weights called asphalt, and others with low molecular weights called malthenes. Together, they add asphalts of typical viscelastic character.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it is treated as liquid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost solid, while at low temperatures it is supposed to falsify, added.
This means that asphalt resistance in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures, alerted an expert to chemical engineering.
A Chemical Faculty scientist observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México were covered by a flexible tile made up of six layers of materials, the last three of which were mixed with asphalt.
There is an asphalt cartridge, formed by small pebbles cast in asphalt and then compressed, between the top layers.
He emphasized that every stone that forms a insert is to cast it with asphalt.
When passing a car or putting pressure on it, it is possible that the forces in the tiles will be well broken down.
If it were a modified asphalt, it would be even better to decompose, think of a chemical engineer.
He added that on the asphalt insert, the last layer of the canvas, which was made up of fine stones, is also covered in asphalt, is placed on the asphalt sand.
Given that this layer will come into contact with the axles of vehicles, it must have a greater mechanical force than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the vehicles.
Since a large load will be exposed as part of the pavement, the coat must have a sufficient thickness and must be alert to the material from which it is made.
Klima, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that needs to be remembered. Especially water has a great influence on the functionality of asphalt inserts.
Once the terrain is wet, water spreads in, and it's hard to get out, it causes softening all layers of tiles and thereby creating vymolů.
He explained that during the creation of the exhausts, the film of the cape is the first and then the asphalt insert is damaged. However, there is no damage at one point, but it is a slow process that should be stopped at the first marks by means of appropriate maintenance programmes.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor in the creation of exhausts, and therefore the thickness of each individual plot must correspond to the burden of vehicles and must be guaranteed that this load does not exceed. Only so can we prevent the frequent generation of requirements.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that, as far as asphalt is concerned, we still have a lot of work and research ahead of us. For example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available in other countries, enabling us to easily repair tares without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez Serena did not obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first multimission.
Valle del Cauca has not yet reached the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Senna had to be satisfied that she was on the basis of which she had become the new first multimission of Colombia.
On the basis of the results of yesterday's finals in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico was won, the first title of the first multipleis was received by Miss Atlantico. Melina joined the crowds of the women from Valle del Cauca, who got to reach the won crowns, but were eventually released by the first multiples.They included Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Marí Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcérerere (2000), Cata’s’s’s’s ‘Garia’, Michela’, and ‘Garia’.
The question many ask, what was missing?
The result is the defeat of a great favor which in all previous rounds has shown that she has to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing has become the Queen of Police and Joile de Volgue. These titles have been achieved, for example, by Talian Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who have subsequently received the title of Miss Colombia.
One key factor that decided that the jury decided to name it only The first multi-mission is that she did not testify to her answer to the question: "What book did you like most, and why?", which Martín Murillo Gómez of the literary paper Leamos.
The applicant replied to the question:
I believe very much in the role of literature, I believe that it is one of the forms of cultivation. The book that influenced me most in childhood was the "Mallow Prince", a very deep book.
It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature that we should all know, and today I have a book from Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian author. It is a wonderful book called "El Arcor de la sangre".
This answer, however, did not like it because of the term "culturalisation" and secondly because the candidate did not explain what the books mentioned meant to her.
After the end of Melina's ceremony, she said she's calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise what is to happen.
And you people, read, if you can, a little prince is a beautiful book."
One other hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
Bogotský journalist indicated that the candidate was the most popular, most celebrated and the one who had received all previous prizes (Gastronomy challenge Oster, public title for the best art dress and Queen's mother), caused envy to other candidates, stressed the queen, who then burned down on the scene.
It was apparent during the first presentation of the swimmers on the Hilton beach and during two shows before the final coronation.
Even though it shined on both of them, it was known that she lacked strength and heat, which demonstrated representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osoria, a journalist at the Canal RCN program, believes that Melinda received the title of the first multimissions confirms that the candidate who finally gets the most titles does not leave with the Queen's crown.
In addition, in recent days, Valle had a rather unfriendly attitude towards the media, and that didn't pay him back.
Another hypothesis is that Valle couldn't convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Only on the edge, two days before the election of the international member of the jury, Lucy Doughty stated that she was looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In Miss Colombia's competition, beauty is not enough for itself, there is a need to see more than just physical beauty. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explains.
It is also speculative of the fact that the candidate Valle lost points because of the shortcomings of her background and the fibrosia which was on the back. However, this is entirely contrary to the verticum of the jury, which chose her mission of "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, correct nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernan Orozco, who prepares Queens, acknowledges that Melina didn't have the best body, that there were better girls here, "but problems with the fibrosis on the back, which, in my opinion, wasn't very familiar, took her points until the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos from Cromos believes that her native Valle made a mistake when she took several surgery.
"Chirurgical interventions are fine, but they didn't succeed in Valle.
The body was never her strong suit, and here she chose her tax."
Because of this award, which for the first time was awarded to the National Beauty Assembly, there was a cruel prediction after the swimmer show, which was filled with it. It was claimed that this was a satisfaction Raymundo Melina wished that he would not have to grant it the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina started her reign today, not as queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions where she will be appointed alone by the National Competition.
However, he writes himself in history as one of the queens, who, despite the enduring success in Cartagena, did not get to the highest crown.
That's what Cali's job was to identify Alfons Cana's corpse.
The expert on Cali's fingerprints came into history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alphons Cana".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, last year, an expert on CTI fingerprints in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader Farc: "Alphonse Cana", by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprints experts working on the CTI department, this week, she was a line to Elias González, a man from Puert Tejada, who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at city hall in Chocó, where he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to a place where the dead were identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after graduating from the appropriate courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with a study of friction of skin, i.e. palms and legs.
The week Alfonsi Cano was performed, Eliazar told him to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
He went to Cauca on Friday night in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew he would have to identify two corpses and suspect that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerilla in the world. Therefore, they asked him to take a card with the fingerprints of Guiller León Sáenza (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the place where the corpse was found, he did not recognize him because of physical arousal, he looked quite different from the media.
He had no beard, dressed as a villager in a given area, without glasses, much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Together with the galton lup, ink and transplanter and the light Eliazar began to compare the dactylic body records with the records from the card.
It didn't disappoint her, it was "Alfonso Cano."
The same night a man from Puerto Tejada was appointed to minister of defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, confirmed whether he was really the chief commander of Farc.
Track Search
For dactyloscope of Sijín de Cali, the recognition that Eliazar González showed to President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of operative services against "Cano" is very important.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no error, which can play a key role in deciding crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help to investigate crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the persons captured.
When they're caught, a lot of delinquents present false documents or don't have papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and we look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because in this place the thief resisted to pull out a safe filled with jewels and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprints, but in this case we could get a full-hand print and identify the perpetrator who participated in several thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or reverse suspicion in the event of murder.
They found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him the other day.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for murder and that the bottle print actually confirmed it.
Even though there's no way to confirm that he was really a murderer, it's obvious that he showed up at the scene of a crime.
The CTI fingerprints expert explained that the prints are "set by means of chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, a transplant or belt is used for their collection.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, a delinquent database or a registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians, whose data is nowhere to be taken," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just like everything that's sparkling isn't gold, not everything you touch stays clues.
However, if used, the corresponding comparison must be made.
"Indignation" protests in New York
Hundreds of manifestants were pushing themselves to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to stand.
A large part of them were waiting to clear the space and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Round Wall Street movement provoked on Tuesday, representatives of New York City when they tried to get back to Manhattan Square, from where they were taken out in the morning, and then tried to take another New York Park.
Hundreds of manifestants were distressed at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get through a court order that allows "mutilated" to return to place. The second part of the movement reacted to the removal by taking the park in the north of the city, where further detention occurred.
"If the court doesn't allow us to return to the square, we'll settle in another place and continue legal battles to return to Zuccotti, both through the assembly and peaceful manifestations," said one of the spokespersons of the movement "Let's Set Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray stated that the response of the "mutilated" to the removal of the camp, which was ordered by mayor of New York himself, Michael Bloomberg, came to a court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting violent removal of the site and allowed the manifesters to continue to stand here.
In addition, "breeding" also took another park located on the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the parish in Trinity Church.
At least an hour later, they managed to take the place, but then the police came and held some manifestos. Bray didn't know the exact number, but he said he saw that the ties were set up by some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people settled on the site, and the delegates of religious leaders came to express their support and also tried to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square, which is private property, remains closed. There is a trial that should happen on Tuesday, and during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the relocations even distributed and distributed a copy of the court order and even gave it to the citizens who were guarding the square, which caused some "some small conflicts", said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police officers were beating.
The court order forbids the authorities to move the members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or to use "the laws which were published after the congregation has started, or to ban the manifestestes from entering the park with shops or other places that had previously been used".
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out for the press that, given this court order, the city stopped reopening the public space, and the manifestos pointed out that the local laws did not allow them to return tents and sleepers.
The supreme representative of the city personally prevented the early eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which it was held to 200 people and to which it was added, because the manifestostants "distorted the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the square because it became a "place where people didn't go to protest, but to break laws and in some cases to hurt others" because "some shops got won threatening letters" and "the judges were worried about the quality of their lives".
"The morning clearance was terrible and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests at the expense of the U.S. working people," he added the spokesperson movement, who accused the mayor that "they don't weigh freedom of expression".
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also stated that they were planning to organize "big actions" on Thursdays in cooperation with community and union organizations to remind two months after which protests are held, because they began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will represent Miss Maria on a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" will appear on 1 December.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in "Home Improment", a swimmer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", a wife of a year's musician Tommy Lee and now an actress and a model will be Miss Mary on a special Canadian TV show.
A private TV station today announced that Anderson, along with the singer of sentimental songs Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, will appear in the TV program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December and will incarnate the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from the TV program in which Anderson, also known from online pornographic images, will appear with her ex-husband, "Mötley Crüe" engine, Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll in the caves representing Jesus.
As Josef appears on stage Peters, a famous Canadian commist of Indian origin, who recently served as a moderator on the tour of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
Krome Anderson and Peters, the Canadian singer Bublé, who was married in Buenos Aires with the Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March, appears on a special Christmas broadcast by CTV.
Recently Bublé called American Kim Kardashian on one of her concerts in New York "Lies."
Japan returns to life after a destructive earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% due to household consumption and thus the fall period started in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, now recovers from a destructive earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that has been facing the country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have calculated material losses of $300,000, a blow that, despite the difficult global situation, heal well.
After three quarters of falls, the GDP between July and September got into such a position that it was possible to reverse the page: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% a year.
Results of the second quarter - for Japan, the tax year starts in March 2012 - in addition, the largest growth rate is projected as compared with January to March 2010.
Recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery necessary for the recovery of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Enterprises have increased their investments by 1.1%, expenditure will decrease by 0.9% compared to January to March. This is the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impulse that forces us to use the crisis to come out of it to strengthen or restore the infrastructure.
Japan has woke up. Especially due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Stigma yenu
Toky believed in the internal market when yen - Japanese currency - became one of the "warran values" for investors who ran from the euro area debt crisis and against the disturbing forecasts of the US. It is a privilege, which is at the same time a great burden on export firms.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for the country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony added their weak results in July until September just the yen course.
While markets continue to circumvent the EU’s marginal countries, Yoshiiko Noda’s government is cautious.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen", said yesterday the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that the majority of Member States showed in September clear signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator, predicting inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
She dropped four decimals to 100,4 points compared to 100,8 in August.
Eurozone even got below the average, which is located at level 100. It got up to 99.13 points.
Athens once again spreads uncertainty
Papadimos says that austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With rapid and risky marginal guarantees and uncertainty that once again prevailed, Greece is increasingly involved in the labyrinth, which leads to the exit from the great debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "agreement" of the new transitional Greek government is given rather to the demands of Brussels than the true convictions of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received during his appointment would probably be short for their application, the President of the conservative party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, declared that the new austerity measures would in no way support and repeat its demand for writing new elections to the estimated date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to apply the summit decision of 26 October," Papadimos said yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the vote on government confidence.
Package with 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new anti-tax evasion measures will be among the first initiatives.
However, the Samaras message makes no sense regarding his position: "We have committed to helping a transitional government, but we have no longer committed ourselves to anything else."
In his speech to the EU and the IMF, the President of the Conservators went a little far away. These organisations are supposed to unlock 8 billion which Athens urgently needs, but said that it would not support and sign any commitment to meeting austerity measures.
The European Commission, which has already caused Papandre to play with the referendum, stressed yesterday that its demands are inconclusive: it will not block any aid if the new government and the representatives of the main parties do not sign a "written commitment without biscality and as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens and will deal with a new government about what he needs to pay for the sixth part" 8 billion.
The Greek bee has a little bit more of what to do.
Queen Sofia: "There are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the privileged position of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "a significant global position has been achieved in terms of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades, with regard to this cooperation tool, the essence of which lies in "the instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is an instrument based on trust in man".
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th global micro-loans summit in Valladolid with the belief that "it is not doubt" that this kind of operation "is absolutely necessary" to reach the Millennium Objectives set by the United Nations by 2015. "It is the purpose of achieving half the number of people who live with less than one dollar per day, i.e. the amount which sets the threshold of poverty".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly", highlighted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of Summit, which lasts until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", which are intended primarily for them.
"We have reached many," and "many challenges are still ahead."
The summit of microloans is to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports the 'base' objectives.
Her Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services and that 100 million families would have reached the threshold of poverty under which they now live.
The concept of micro-loans spread to Spain and to other countries of the world after "the pioneer of Muhammad Yunus' idea went on this path," said the Queen and added that it was "the act of justice and the necessary recognition".
The father described this instrument as a "distinguishing idealist who went on the way to the fight against poverty". She met with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet directly in place with his policy loan.
Following this experience, the first global summit in Washington and other meetings such as the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006. "In all of these meetings, I could continue to develop constant development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support of this project, served yesterday the title of the "head of the family" awarded to her in Valladolid "the movement of the poor".
Queen Sofia ended her performance by inviting participants to engage in discussions and searching for solutions and thus allowing them to continue fighting poverty.
"Ethical Imperative."
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, stated that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" to follow all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to combine cooperation with developing countries only with the Ballophobia period, because this cooperation is a "permanent duty".
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty" and now more than ever before governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and not let solidarity become the victims of cuts.
For Spain, micro-loans are one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The state secrets for international cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to people who all of them close the door. Mayor Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in a city that "opens its gates to the spirit of solidarity that is contagious".
The CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of general voting rights
Without serious difficulties for Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party of Angela Merkel, the first day of the Christian-democratic Union Congress (CDU) took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but it became, until autumn, especially in order to be satisfied by the members of the parties who consider the government's policy today towards the Greeks and possibly to the Italians as cheap tomorrow.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the number of 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
The several-minute ovation stands at the end of Angela Merkel's performance, and after several hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, a very pro-European Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of Chancellor and the proposal can be summarised in the slogan: the response to the crisis "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "the ten million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to Chancellor, "the time has come to change" in Europe.
This could express changes in the Treaty of Lisbon in order to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of euro area Member States, but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general electoral right "to give Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, which clearly inspires Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all twenty seven countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary step: against the United Kingdom and CDU leaders, Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same position.
But the direction is out of control.
In the same way, the delegates rejected a large majority of the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the board of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of its economy, which will clearly result in the strengthening of the weight of Germany.
Veden's mayor of calming the climate inside her party, Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmuta Kohl. She was not trying to get a congress talk about the 'small' European states or about states that are in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal for Europe is devoted to one paragraph of the importance of "French-German Friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she reminded me that just two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What constitutes labour inability fraud?
After the support, the Party of the UMP and the Government of the Offensive against Labour Incompetence are launched.
Nicolas Sarkozy will attend the Social Aid Office on Tuesday 15 December in Bordeaux, where he will address the issue repeated since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As a result of this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased strictness, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on labour incompetence.
First, due to budgetary savings, the government intends to force private sector workers on the fourth day of incompetence before they start taking disease aid.
Of course, without the approval of the company, the employee who is sick would lose four days of wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
Measures that risk causing much bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring EUR 280 million.
And also the measures that would be followed by further symbolic measures: to give state employees one day of incapacity (although not yet incompetence compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are discussed, the rightful majority also launches the topics of fraud focused this time on corruption linked to labour incompetence.
"The checks will be much more extensive and further: if you are caught, you will be returning", pointed out Xavier Bertrand during the interview provided by the RTL station on Sunday 13th November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate in view of the fact of injustice in the work of incompetence.
These have actually been the subject of continuous monitoring since 2002 and the political support that brought fruit.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance malady (CNAM) more than €237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, in 2008, daily refunds with EUR 11.3 billion were 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity contributions and accidents and 54% of employment accidents, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
That means only 2.5% of the health costs.
According to Alma Consulting, in 2010, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which contained some deviations: another survey published in 2007 on Monster.com's employment pages showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees asked responded that no working day had been chosen.
Another study, this time carried out by institutions of sickness insurance, states that in 2010 37.8% of employment incompetence was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% lasted longer.
If we compare them with their European neighbours, French employees are no longer more likely to be incompetence.
One long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absence (for health reasons or not) was established in France between 10% and 11.8% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
cheating in in incompetence represents only a very small part compared to black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only a small extent.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks aimed at working incompetence for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM concluded that at 1.5 million controls were 13.8% of 285,000 carried out due to the short-term incapacity of "irregular or too long", i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacity of more than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadapted or unauthorized" were counted against 1,2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
In total, 169 000 "unlawable" cases for several million employees who were incompetence.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing the work of black.
According to UMP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent EUR 9 to EUR 15 billion missing in taxing for the year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily compensation and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos put these words in front of Parliament and added that a hundred days of his government would not be enough to perform this task.
"To reinstate our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget rescue plan," said the Head of Government when he was on Wednesday his first public speech at the opening of the debate on trust in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the Eurozone Summit will be the "main task" of the new government, because our country is involved in the euro area, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country would now be "in the vicinity of 9%" of the gross domestic product, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rule rejects new austerity measures
Mr Antonis Samaras said on Monday his support to the measures already approved to try to escape from the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party was not committed to any additional austerity measures.
"For no new measure we will raise our hand", stressed Samaras at his meeting with the Members of New Democracy.
We have agreed targets for reducing deficit and debt and fighting waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs and Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan EUR 8 billion without written guarantees from all parties that would support the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word would suffice and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the Committee of Experts
According to the Royal Canadian Society, death is denied to Canadians.
In the issue of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
The Canadian Society lives with the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the possibility of speaking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take decisions in that sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, involving six experts working in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
This commission recommends that the government amend the criminal law so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, if this option appears to be necessary for the patient considered competent to take such a decision.
In the beginning, experts quote the recent survey of independent economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 planet countries.
Even though Canada placed its 10th place, the study notes that "the medicalisation of death in Canada has created culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medication yes or no, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, they tell us experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home with most Canadians, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to Canada, while Québec is the highest number of 86% of people died in the hospital.
As regards the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicides, the report authors come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government which has already said that in criminal law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicides do not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also reviewed all countries where such approaches are legalised or are not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this de-crimination causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicides to persons wrongly or unconfirmed.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed more than many cases of these riots yesterday in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legal.
"The euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Asist suicide is also done in Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are entangled by euthanasia
Let us remind you that, according to an inquiry by Angus Reid's Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already been expressed in favour of euthanasia because they believe that they will allow people at the end of their lives to make their suffering easier.
And 66% believe that legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we send messages about the life of the elderly or the disabled being less valuable.
With regard to those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of the persons questioned consider that they should not be prosecuted.
In matters of maintenance or interruption of patient care, the situation is less clear, says the authors of the report.
In the list of their recommendations, they also propose that withdrawal from treatment for which there is legitimately confirmed refusal is not punishable.
The Commission of Experts also requires that experts be educated to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their life without fearing criminal prosecution.
In the issue of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final relief, the Commission is demanding that it be considered at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Refunds of other experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society expert report.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a medical specialist, qualified as experts-signors of the report as "extreme" because he does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the sick at the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who has more than 18 years of age might ask him to help commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied résumé reports yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that it looks like the authors of the report build autonomy of persons over all other values that create social forefathers.
For "in society, he says, there are warning marks and limitations."
Margaret Somerville's medical law specialist also expressed strong objections to the conclusions of the report which she qualified as "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, a member of the Royal Canadian Society, is particularly doubtful of the dates of the report on the absence of doubts in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordan king calls President Assad to resign
Damascus talks about "comploma"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The Stoupents of Bashar al-Assada yesterday demonstrated before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria were strengthened by President Bashar Al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and speaks of a "complost" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the Arab States, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, took an opinion in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was the first ruler of the Arab state to be invited by President Bashar al-Assad to be killed in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the military forces of the regime were killed," he presided power."
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to give a demise, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, a neighboring country with Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
For his part, the Head of Turkish Diplomacy Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts made by Turkish intermediation in the Syrian regime, which had not been crowned with success since the beginning of the year.
"The people who are not in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," said Turkey with an insult to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey applies increasingly harder lines.
The United States rejoiced in the 'consistection against Assad and the disrespectful action of the Syrian regime' following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"International Communities, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey use increasingly hard tone" towards repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As the Syrian Human Rights Observatory announced, during this period Deraa died in the south of Syria, 16 civilians and 19 members of the Adversary Forces.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilian people died"in gunfights and concentrated shootings from heavy machine guns in Jobar in Homs.
At a press conference, however, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Mouall estimated that the country had gone on its way out of the crisis."
After all, he responded lively to the Arab League decision to suspend Damascus' membership, which, according to him, is a dangerous step.
Syria's not bowing', he added with assurance that"comploments brought against Syria do not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering the mechanism of civil protection" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favorably inclined by the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he believes is "paranoid".
The new League Special Meeting is called tomorrow to Rabat to take the view on a plan to resolve the crisis that was decided on 2 December and in which it was intended to bring in particular the army from the cities bound by dispensation and the release of imprisoned manifestos.
The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered yesterday the decision of the Arab League to be a failure", while China urged Syria to adopt the plan to solve the crisis, yet completely avoiding the support of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requires time and sacrifices for Italians
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start using a program that will contain"probes" in order to regain credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before meeting with experts and employers today.
He should set up a relatively slim cabin composed of technocratics not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about an important program with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups involved in interviews, after a meeting with the appointed Prime Minister.
President of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament to give his confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti as a part of the small team of the twelve ministers of President Giorgi Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness of the financial markets and asked for time.
In the "democracy pays precise terms" as regards the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed and added that the markets would be patient and understanding."
His appointment as president was initially welcome, but concern has once again appeared after the unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team involving mainly the technocratic people, although he stressed that he would like to take "politics" into it.
He expressed his belief that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranca Fini's new government will be trusted by Parliament by Friday.
Mario Monti promised after taking up office that he would act with extraordinary urgency and in order to make Italy a strong article" Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn spokesperson stressed that our diagnosis of the Italian economy is not changing with the new government."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not reach its goal of a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new hard measures.
The head of the Confindustria Emma Marcegagliová business union, which meets Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy" or the country that does not show growth, cannot follow the deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence, "professor" symbolizing according to the editorial authors "the invitation to seriousness" and "other Italy", represents for Italy "epochal change" after 17 years "berlusconism".
Big unknown will be the life of his team.
The President of Napolitano would like to avoid premature elections, as Italy must place government bonds by April 2012 for EUR 200 billion.
The Soviet scientist helped Iran’s nuclear programme
The Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danileko helped Iran develop a detonator used for nuclear weapon, reporting on Tuesday an American NGOs specialized in atomic risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAAE) and other documents that are missing from this UN Agency.
Last week, the MaAE said its "principal concern" as regards the "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to the Institute of ISIS, the wide drawing from the MAAE documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934), should work for three decades from the 1960s in the Soviet Military Research Center in Celjabinsk (Ural), where he should deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, the Centre had to leave to set up a "nano-diamanta" manufacturing undertaking in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his society were to bring him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then had to cooperate before returning to Russia from 1996 to 2002 in the Iranian program.
In his recent MAAE report, the clear indication is that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked during a substantial part of his career on this technology in the framework of the military programme of the country where it came from".
Anti-Muslim crimes and delicacies increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of criminal acts and delicacies aimed at Muslims increased almost by 50% between 2009 and 2010, while, at the same time, the other racial and religious violence fell slightly or has risen slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed to Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% increase compared to the 13% increase in catholic violence, a decrease of 4% in anti-Jews and a total increase of 14% in anti-Religious crime and delicts.
The total number of "independent crimes" was very slightly increased by 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% were, according to the FBI, motivated by racial differences and 20% religious differences.
"After the end of 2009 it is disturbing to see these crimes and delicacies rise again", stressed the Human Rights First of Human Rights dealing with human rights, "the increase of anti-Muslim violence is particularly important," she added the organization in her communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hateful crime, must be considered a serious human rights violation", adds one of Paul Legendre's leading leaders.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these evils," adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports on "unfaith criminal actions".
"A hateful crime" in U.S. federal law is an inheritance to the time of fighting for civil rights.
This rule of law was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence associated with race, color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and looks like more Facebook
The Twitter microblog service site introduced changes in design on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of the followers, which somewhat like its Facebook service.
New offers "action" and "name" allow you to better and directly know the activities of other people who follow you or people whose answers you ("tweets") are following.
This allows you to know whether they allow you to follow the contributions, whether they apply to new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new Twitter face was tested"in August at a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, said the spokesperson of Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive operation, with terms rather incomprehensible (RT for the repeated dissemination of the contribution of someone else, the folklorefriday pour recommander de suivre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'uvre aninsi and un public plus large unniement plus comparable and target des réseuaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately assess the importance of this innovation in their "tweets".
"It's unnecessary, it takes a lot of places and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Funkce Activity helps me to follow some of the elements of my Twitter", sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
entering the gold rules on a balanced budget into the Constitution
The Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in the power of Austria, decided on Tuesday on the entry of the "gold rule" of budgetary policy into the Constitution to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid any reduction in the assessment of Austria by credit rating agencies (AA).
He was himself a social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced this decision to conclude the advice of ministers in a situation where Austrian public debt is with 74.6% high over the criterion of up to 60% of the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had only been reduced by one single degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros each year," argued the multi-channel and foreign minister, the Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus calls upon the summit of euro area countries held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where Heads of State and Government strongly asked that by the end of 2012 a reduction in the public deficit and the achievement of a balance between public accounts be entered in a constitution or law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the 'German model', Germany was the first European country to adopt such 'right'.
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) each year, starting with 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal State will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the federal countries as well as the municipalities will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to make public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty within the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong only
Noda threatens a new intervention on foreign exchange markets
On Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again on foreign markets if only to continue strengthening.
"We will succeed, like we did the last time, if we detect excessive instability" in the exchange rate just, he explained to the Y-Noda Senate.
On Tuesday, only once again, he went up to historical values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold money to reduce the value of Japanese currencies, which only recently exceeded the record against the dollar valid since 1945.
However, since then, there has been a regular increase in the buy-in of investors who consider him to be a "safe port" in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European crisis due to debt.
The dollar went back to 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic line of 105 yen near the level that caused the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar had a value of around 120 yen and the euro had more than 160 yen.
This redundancies Japanese currency damage island export because it reduces the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the yield of Japanese foreign companies when they transfer them to domestic currencies.
"Japan recovers" from the ruin caused by the March earthquake and the tsunami wave, which destroyed the Tohoku region in the north-east of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who is afraid of not killing this betrayal in the egg of a fragile recovery.
The third economic power of the world renewed growth in the third quarter (1.5% due to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year due to a survey of the growth of exports and household consumption under disaster.
But the Prime Minister concluded that the high value of just a few did not reflect the 'national economy of Japan'.
The Japanese Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which launched on Tuesday's two-day meeting of its political and monetary council to take all possible measures to weaken only.
However, the multi-engineer of this institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, pointed out that BoJ had already adopted "bad measures" indicating that no additional monetary weakening can be expected at the centre.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the securities issuing institution increased by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of state Treasury bonds and increased to EUR 55,000 billion (€519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts devoted to the purchase of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
Eurozone:
Rates rise, storms fail
The debt crisis risk continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and a better number of growth in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
The European Stock Exchange is still concerned about the stability of the euro area on Tuesday, 15 November, is falling into negative expectations.
In Paris at 10 hours the CAC 40 is losing 1.4% to 3.064 points.
Index Dax in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new tensions around the profits of euro area Member States' loans in difficulty, only part of recent profits continue to be generated by stock markets worldwide."
"Versional investors only realize the risk of the disease", explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker, quoted by Reuters.
The burza in Tokyo has fallen by 0.7%, which has suffered due to the concerns of market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan as well as the rest of the world has eyes on Europe and the shift will continue only in the narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized", estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager with Ichiyos Investment Management.
This relaunch of uncertainty about the future of the euro area damages the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest level since the month and a half ago.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency has a $1.3570 value at a 0.4% retreat.
According to the currency brokers, the currency was removed after the CDU side of Angela Merkel's Chancellors adopted a proposal at their congress on Monday proposing the possibility of leaving the euro area for countries which will find themselves in difficulties without therefore having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
The interest rates for loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning, on Tuesday, the return of Italian ten-year-old bonds is 6.85% and the return of Spanish ten-year-old bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the South European countries, but also in France, continue to strengthen market concerns.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, was strongly demanding time in the markets to correct the situation in Italy, at risk of poisoning due to the outflow of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the Eurozone summit would be "main task" of his government.
Spain is again reinvented in the intentional line of markets when elections to the Parliamentary House on Sundays.
The tariff difference ("spread") between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
Pending the figures on euro area growth
Statistical figures say that France recorded in the third quarter economic growth by 0.4% due mainly to household consumption, i.e. a little better than expected growth by 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised downwards numbers for the second quarter to decrease by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in fact, it's the fourth quarter that the economists are most concerned about.
Germany registered growth by 0.5% over the same period.
The first estimates for the whole euro area are expected at 11 hours, while the European Commission has just pointed out the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a theme that cannot be understood on the basis of short-term balances or under emotions, then it is an energy policy.
Disability and electricity price have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural for the election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that absorbs core energy.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, 7 billion human beings are on the planet, but demographic developments are due to double demand for electricity by 2050, unless we want a significant part of the world's population to remove important parts of life.
At the same time, there will be a need to face the lack of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, and it is not possible to forget the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in order to combat climate change, which is the subject that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
An accident in Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case of Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find another source capable to replace itself or Switzerland, which considers it appropriate to build only the last generation power plants.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue to decide in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by renewing the construction of one plant interrupted after the crash of Three Mile Island.
If a German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts it.
Berlin’s choice is shown by the scratching of electricity prices, increased energy dependency on gas imported in particular from Russia, the sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of electricity plants on natural gas and coal.
We will feel all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The Danish case deserves us to think about it.
The European Winding Power Champion, from which 30% of its electricity is collected, is also one of the largest coal and gas consumers due to wind integrity, with CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices higher by 65%, respectively 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, our energy policy will pay our neighboring electricity bill 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in a globalised energy economy, energy costs represent a key factor of competitiveness and guarantee for the industry to remain on national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the most cheap electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a strong increase in electricity prices that would make an illusionous statement of reindustrialisation of our country and defence of purchasing power.
The price the great majority of the French refuses to pay, just as it does not fundamentally oppose this energy, as it shows the polls of public opinion.
Let us remind you that our country's energy policy has enabled the sector to build 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 jobs.
The strong export industry is bringing large quantities of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have lost EUR 6 billion per year for exporting nuclear facilities and services.
Which plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years while the fall of its manufacturer would be planned?
When dealing with an energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magic source for energy production, or that there is no devilish.
The development of low CO2 emissions plants and renewable energy facilities carried out by the French AREVA industrial group indicates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromised and transparent surveillance of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionalism is recognised have the idea of blood safety.
In 50 years, he recognized the nuclear industry three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island was in normal operation conditions and remained without human victims and environmental consequences.
In Montenegro, drama caused the concept of a reactor and unforgivable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented extent that caused the death of tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this crash as much as it did in the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the co-operation between the French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor represents a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all those who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it to stop its construction in Flamanville, it would be an excellent gift to the competitors of the AREVA Group and EDF and free the way to establish a leading position in nuclear development.
It is vital and legitimate to look for the best solution to energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
Immigration policies conducted for Nicolas Sarkozy have been criticised from different angles - police, courts and administrations, subject to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of human rights, which France boasts.
Recently, it was an administrative harassment, the object of which was foreign students who had become present when the Minister of Interior (see Libération dated 23 May) declared that France" does not need foreign talent, walls and waitresses".
But so far, it has rarely been discussed at the angle of the economy.
It is necessary to say that there is a broad consensus between the left and right in this area.
To the right of the tone in 1976, Jacques Chirac gave his statement that"900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country where there are 2 million migrant workers" and Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France" cannot accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, fear of invasion of the hordes of Polish installations in the French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and on the French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we are giving to immigrants.
In his programme François Hollande is limited to banality when it indicates that joint developments will allow us to solve our "migrant problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and the problem may be true in elections, but it is economically very expensive.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recalled in their recently published work synthesized latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.m.): there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries which immigrants accept.
Restrictions on immigration will stifle growth and harm employment.
Fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and put pressure on reducing their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more supplemented than substitutes for French employees by performing work in sectors with a lack of employees.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Like a surgeon, he will have difficulties working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, this addition between the French and the migrants causes the arrival of immigrants to have a positive effect on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that the increase in migration movements by 1% resulted in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And yet, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants brought about contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalised immigrants among the US price holders; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems on average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that in Germany one immigrant will come at 30 years of age to bring a net contribution (received minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 for his entire life in public budgets.
Nicolas Sarkozy said at the beginning of his mandate that he wished to reach for the lack of growth"with a valued teeth".
The teeth used to reflect immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, we have to think about European democracy
Democracy is rare and also very fragile goods.
The European continent should remember that, although it had been invented in Athens two thousand years ago, he experienced the tragedy of world wars, totality regimes, holocaust, gulags, as well as France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some people could believe that, in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to make choices and make it as direct as possible.
But they already know from Napoleon that it was an easy thought.
General electoral law, although the condition of democracy is necessary, is not a condition sufficient and can be a "republic philosopher Etienne Vacherot" as once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we experience is an economic crisis, but it is just like that and from the beginning of a political crisis and democracy.
Recognising the errors of the Greek referendum of the yes-no type will have the value of double detection in this respect: revealing the need for a great return of political power, but also revealing the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its indifference.
This ambition must be promoted so that it can be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic zone have moved today and that many of the Republican fighters no longer shoot in the right direction.
We can get nothing if we require a number of national referendums organised according to necessity and disorganized.
Bianko exposed to a European absolutist monarch or jump in tied legs into an empty nationalist depth: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we don't want guillotine knives, but common, full-time, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor would we already know where to stop - because the crisis is in Europe.
This is a whole Europe that is intertwined before the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its inability and lack of solidarity.
It is a whole Europe that is humiliated in the international scene.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is a whole Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
The management of the European democratic sovereignty project needs to be urgently returned.
For only together, Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of the government of the markets and make the future.
An exit from the crisis will assume a decision at European level that will not be acceptable without complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After we have fought against this proposal from Socialists and Jacques Delors for a long time, everyone is demanding a European economic government today.
Come on.
But thinking it without stronger political and democratic integration, and being consumed as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new blind alley.
We must take on a new phase of European building.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" Republicans.
The revolution in interest could not be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We need to build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building a Europe more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Free contact" chip cards spread
The world fair of chip cards will open in an optimistic atmosphere on Tuesday in Villipante near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, 2011 should end up with an increase in world card sales with a microprocessor (bank cards, SIM cards) by 11% on more than 6 billion units.
The most carrier is the segment of the contactless technology that allows you to pay in mass transport or manage purchases by simply approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold worldwide 460 million chip cards against 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share should still rise in 2012 (required 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Having been in the country’s APEC for a long time, Europe is gaining a field of uninterrupted payments.
Approximately 26 million bank cards Visa is already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, beginnings are more modest: 400,000 uninterrupted Visa cards have been issued.
But the big business chains work for two.
Carrefour thus issued 2.5 million uninterrupted passport cards this year.
In order to include a higher rate of speed, it is necessary for banks to equip them with their clients from now on.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically in the future their clients with no touch cards", announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payments
But this is only the first step towards the future payment facility: mobile phone.
The NFC Technology (Near Field Communication) required to perform transactions is now equipped with only a small number of devices.
"They're late."
"But their real boom should be next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their world sales in 80 to 120 million units", explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
The Bank Crédit agrile announced yesterday the launch of the Caen test, which will last December until June next year.
iPhone equipment of around 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a case allowing for uninterrupted payments.
The BPCE bank has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société générale announced yesterday that she was preparing to introduce an offer that allowed her clients to pay with a mobile phone without a doubt.
The terrorist front ranges from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram section.
The long-term suspicion that there are volumes of terrorist group Al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Boko Haram niger section is confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had been assured of this since now.
"The way the two organisations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is a great cooperation between them", explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have a similar analysis.
The kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After the members of the AQMI were abducted from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers during the operation carried out by special French units.
French and Nigerian investigators had a few phone calls with chips belonging to terrorists in their basements after intervention.
Thermal axis
The analysis of the calls is leading to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are especially interested in two numbers: one leads to the Nigerian who lived long in Maidguri, a town in the north of Nigeria, which is the collage of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is called close to AQMI and sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt to wait for more convincing evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect has enjoyed external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active", the Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo, said.
In recent months, these "support" has been more and more obvious in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which from now on include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same method of execution, such as devices used by AQMI.
Since then, the international community facing Washington has developed pressure on Nigeria to take into consideration the problems that Boko Haram faced.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened mysticians to be little of good interest.
Quick Success
Section Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and foundationist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of haousa means "The Western education is a sin", approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a combination has quick success.
The Section is regretted and requires strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters are starting to fight against the Central Government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram’s followers became extremely active and multiplied by their attacks against police stations.
Government responses are the same as usual.
The army will surround the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the Mohammed Yusuf cult is captured and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group radicalizes and leaves its territory in the north.
At Christmas 2010, an assassination will take place in Jos, where 80 people will die, followed by another in Abuja's capital.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attack the police headquarters in their first suicide attack.
And in August, the UN local office will be the first international target.
The creation of terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now concerned by all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaida Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and iger and the Somals from the Al-Shabab movement operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said that France is in an emergency and is ready to submit all information."
World according to presidential candidates
On issues relating to China, Iran or Israel’s assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are being brought forward in simplification and ignorance.
Can America's weakened crisis manage the world with simple or even simplifying ideas?
The voters might think when listening to the presidential candidates.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have repeated the false statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstituted slogans on China, Iran, or Israel’s help are intertwined.
Mitt Romney, the best self-representing candidate in the race for Republican nomination, threatened the Chinese occupation before the World Trade Organization and their accusations" because of the manipulation of their currency, which is a carrier theme in America, scattered migration across its industry towards Asia.
Even worse, if this must include the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama ambassador in China, and the only candidate having a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, nearly smothered with a position that exterminates" emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who is in the last places in electoral estimates, remains incomprehensible.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised the military strike to Iran if they did not succeed in stopping his nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll put Ian in prison," said the fanfaronist.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase the military assistance of Israel, accusing Obama that he had failed in his duties towards this partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, the other best placed candidate, shows a embarrassing ignorance of documents.
Recently, he called for a sharp stand against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing" is attempting to develop nuclear capacity" - obviously unknown fact that China has had its own nuclear weapon since 1964!
The Texas governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike Iran, says of himself he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight against drug cartels.
The use of torture against supposed terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michel Bachmann.
They are all far from being a Republican candidate, John McCain, in 2008 heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won the Cold War.
They remind that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the sudden departure of "boys" from Iraq, his excuses for Libya and thus attach him to the sticker of the weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population assesses President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positive.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military intervention that leads to a breakup.
And with the arguments that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically so that it can be resuscitated by its leading position, Obama knocks to the right place.
Nord Stream, a new Russian gas port to Europe
Nord Stream remote gas pipeline connecting directly Eastern Europe to Russia and led down the Baltic Sea began to work.
They must supply gas equal to equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas industry, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including 4 Heads of State and Government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream last Tuesday, a new pipeline that will join Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
The symbolic German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedív, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together in control around the valve of the Russian gas input into the Western European network.
This new gas pipeline starts to flow each year to Western Europe 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas by the first pipeline of 1 224 km connecting the Petrohrad region to the Mecklembursko-Poransian Land.
The second pipe, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will supply a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, a quantity equal to the whole French consumption.
And it is recalled that there is a possibility to build a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, it is early to complete this huge structure of victory.
The project strongly protested Poland and the Baltic countries against the project.
Nord Stream will in fact allow the gas to be supplied directly to Germany without being led by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pressure on Russia by threats of closing it into the Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
It was not most pronounced by Warsaw when she did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "German-Soviet Pact", with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means saying it's a subject politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained greater security of its purchases in this Russian project.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe of energy, because the project has created cracks between Eastern Europeans and the West.
Russia managed barely five years ago to promote its vision of direct alliance between Russia and rich Western states with high gas consumption, whose bearings are approaching their end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organicises us", confirmed François Fillon during the opening ceremony of this gas pipeline and demonstrated at what point there are large gas contracts of things both political and economic.
This explains all the wide smiles of the Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the incoming gas place.
The construction of this pipeline is also a major technical act.
The underwater pipe is made of steel fitted with a concrete envelope to protect from seagoing vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, minefields from World War II had to be avoided.
"Because of their safety, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, spokesperson to Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipeline itself is a long metal hose weighing 242 Eiffel, which is not interrupted anywhere by valves or maintenance stations throughout its length.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leader rejected it when the Swedish people were few eager to see the Russian state company, as permanently settled near their coast.
"In case of failure, we stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute", explains Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builders, but the welds were designed to make the leak once in 100,000 years.
Control of the outside gas pipeline is carried out by an underwater robot drawn by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulation inside.
Thisnut shape device with a diameter of 1 metre is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is compressed by gas.
Within the target, 3 m/s will provide accurate information on possible deformations of metal parts throughout the three days of the journey.
The remote gas pipeline has been designed to work for 50 years without the need for more self-repair.
Gas circulation is easily secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar in the target.
To realize this project, five companies joined forces.
The head of the position remains Gazprom, which holds a share of 51%.
It was joined by the German company E.ON and BASF (5.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was entrusted with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has its registered office in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely beneficial.
Gasprom subsequently rented it for five years with a contract that can be renewed all its capacity for gas transport.
"Gazprom will have a profit from total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported", explains Jens Müller.
The financing of the pipeline was provided with 30% of its shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
Total labour costs should be € 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez Group, investment costs reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will return, because the risk is taken by Gazprom only.
Gas pipeline is coming from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with pine forests.
Ventils of a height of 4,5 metres form an exit gas gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before being transported to the German pipelines.
From Tuesday, this terminal has received one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
When capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine - brand notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to return the joy of writing.
It brings the scent of adventure, the hours spent writing in the light of the candle.
The Moleskine recorder is easily discernable by its black rectangles and its leaves blinded with white colors as if by old times.
He was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decides at that time to place on the market a new design, but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebragondi, a consultant working for the company, is hereby included in the introduction of a new product.
The record shall be inspired by an old production technique "moleskin" (a skin imitation), which is used for the treatment of the bench surface.
This type of notebook was very much appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine returned to the popularity of an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of Avantgard artists up to the 20th century", tells Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand with Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010 sales increased by 26% to settle down on 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is distant from hidden production from the first years when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to compile some artificial portrait of the buyer because the notebook will impress businessmen as well as students or professionals.
The image of "Moleskine" is that his owners are people of space-political, cultivated and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, has almost a hundred of them today, and since 2008, has had two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to the bookshop and through the chain of FNAC shops to small boutiques in the city centre, where he could intercede his identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and this need for new writing, through the stormy development of e-mails", explains Maria Sebragondi.
This cultural sign is accompanied by the development of the register Moleskine: the brand recently opened the exhibition" Zacházka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
On the occasion of the Locarn Film Festival in August, she also introduced new records of the leoparda record.
Moleskine benefits from his success and this cultural aura and diversifys his products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop case ... The brand extends to a variety of carriers.
Success, which became dependent: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe's investment funds, today's Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskin's history.
Why is there such a high share of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of the disabled are looking for a job.
Today it opens 15th week for employing disabled people.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed disabled persons is twice the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the whole population.
Is it dazzling?
"No, he's underlining Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt Association, which organizes Week for Employment of Hendikepts."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"At the time, the percentage of unemployed was not twice, but three times higher."
There is nothing left to do about it.
It should be said that for unemployed disabled persons, numerous obstacles persist before they enter their work.
This is an older person: 37% has more than 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low qualification: 80% has no graduation and from 2.3 million college students are only 10,000 hendikeped.
In the end, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% on average for hendikepts compared to 38%.
In short, these are criteria that are particularly complicated to return to employment and which represent the "Agre problem" according to Christian Grapin, the Director-General of the Tremplin Association, which was established in 1992 to help businesses adopt disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There are still unsolicited, ways of thinking that certainly develops, but too slow.
The study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the questionable managers had" a weak level of knowledge of the disabled" s" overweighted by the idea of persons on mobile chairs and psychological or mental deficiencies".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the objective of employing 6% of the disabled workers set out in the 1987 Law.
The last known numbers that come from 2008 indicate a state equal to 2.6%.
"We are now moving around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, Managing Director of Ageffiph, who is responsible for collecting fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof is the number of fined" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid that fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59.000 provinces to 46.000 (and from 606 to 480 million euro).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
"What luck"
Before Tuesday evening (20h45), French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that will bring them this friendly game.
We won't go so far as to write that there's a conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the stands of Stade de France’s auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hadard made peace.
Five months after the angry gesture of his assailant in the fight against Turkey, Belgic coach was sent to his player only by the words of praise.
"I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures French Lille player.
With regard to the difference between his performances in club matches and national team games, this is one thing and the same is justifiable."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not a Belgium case."
"It is necessary for me to clear my mark."
Hazard, shot against Romania on Thursday night due to this fight against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "fire".
Could not forget the term 'radiance'.
Play against Bleus, who has been encouraging since 7 years and in their winning moves in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
That's more because across from "Jou Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", reminds.
"We crossed right away."
"I can play against them, that's just pleasure!"
Good-bye, Leekens reminded me of "suffice."
"Peace" to fight "failure - a feast."
"Peace" also ceases to exist in the quality of the "sisters" that France has become a very high level team for more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna."
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous amount of work," he's agitated.
While Belgium will miss the next European Championship, a technical footballer would like to see in 2014 on a plane with French direction... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he said.
"We're just building something up, the players are ambitious, they're hungry healthy."
"Know it for the next match" including France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento launches this Wednesday in Lisbon with great optimism barring Bosnia Bosnia (22h00).
Both teams had a realism on their way there.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and especially a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. Portugal’s football representation, with which the rudder has been qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal separates from happiness in fact 90 minutes.
One game remains and one opponent - Bosnia.
Knowing the outcome of Friday (0-0) in hell, the Bosen Zenice seems to be clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour ahead, but it was not able to give him such a precious goal to relieve him.
"It's a good result, however, that contains a risk, because we didn't leave the goal outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese believe that they will go before a audience that should create a warm boiler there, although the match certainly appears to be "very balanced", says the optimist, but carefully considered Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are quite convinced that we can have the upper part", said the twenty-four-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance to be on the Euro 2012", relativated yet the follow-up to Carlos Queiroz.
An inconvenient Friday game in Bosnia forces Portugal to give a goal and win.
An inseparable match can suffice to the Bosnians who also need to give a goal.
"It's a good result, which, however, contains a risk because we didn't leave the goal behind," regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team that has great technical quality and which has players with great individual quality", he added.
Like in Zenica, Portuguese will be interested in developing maximum pressure on the bosen team from the start to not give them time to think."
Good idea, provided he shows up to be realistic this time.
