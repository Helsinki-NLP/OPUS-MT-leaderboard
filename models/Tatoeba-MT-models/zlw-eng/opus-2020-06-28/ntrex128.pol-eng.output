Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will be called muppets
Some of the members of the National Assembly have held a constituency. This is the effect of the proposal to change their title to the Members of the Welsh Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, in the short term of the MWP).
The idea was based on the plans to transform the assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become a part of the spin.
One of the Labour Parliamentaries expressed the concerns of his group, saying that the new name is rhymed with the Welsh words “twp” and “pwpp”.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, the word “twp” means a fool, and the word “pwp” – departures.
One politician of Plaid Cymru said that his group was ‘not satisfied’ with the proposal and presented other solutions.
However, the member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was "open" to change the name. He noted that the word "MWP" was very close to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter "in" is spoken similarly to the letter "u" in the English dialect Yorkshire.
In the context of the assembly, the committee currently working on a draft law amending its name has taken the following position: "The national final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will belong to them".
The Law of Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the assembly to the member of the Welsh Parliament, i.e. the WMP in English, although the short "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among the population.
Members of the assembly propose alternative solutions. The difficulty with reaching consensus is a distress for Elin Jones, the Chairman of the Assembly, who should present a draft law in the next few weeks.
The reform law will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the principle of the withdrawal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their next title when discussing the Act.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of country name
In the coming Sunday, the voters will decide whether their country will soon be named in the name of the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote is intended to help to conclude a dispute with the neighbouring Greece over several decades, in which the region called Macedonia is situated.
The Government in Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor constitutes a territorial claim and has repeatedly opposed the attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Mr Iwanow, President of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on name change, said he would disregard the vote results.
However, plebbiscit supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that the change is necessary to allow you to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Marcin's Church in New York's Church is silent in connection with the problems of Harlem's lost churches
“The older people I talk to are saying that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no sign of them."
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"Actually, people are socializing in a different way," he noted.
"Bary has ceased to be the place of regular meetings between the members of the community."
However, in the case of churches, it is concerned that the measures resulting from the sale of assets will not be sufficient for as long as the decision-making people consider and that they will be at the starting point sooner or later.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartments inhabited by people who would not support other nearby temples.
As he said: “The overwhelming majority of people buying homes in such buildings will be white. It will accelerate the total closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will be members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by the assembly of the white faithful, even before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the Church of St. Marcin joined the community a decade later).
The initial assembly of white Methodists left the district in the 1930s.
The current African-American assembly took over the property rights of the building.
The Church of St. Marcin was taken over by the assembly led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against the sellers of 125th Street (the main trading street in Harlem), who opposed the employment or promotion of African Americans.
The fire of 1939 significantly damaged the building, but the John Howard Johnson parishionist made plans for the reconstruction of the temple and commissioned the construction of a bell band.
Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor to St. Marcin's church, proudly called a new carylion "the call of the poor."
The expert who struck the bells in July described it in a different way, as "cultural treasure" and "unreplaced historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first carylion in the world supported by black music. The artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church in 18 years ago, where a bigger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Marcin's Church didn't replace him.
In recent months, there have been a number of complex events in the Church of St. Marcin, involving architects and performers, and some of them have brought the secular leaders of the church and some — the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the Parafial Council (the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders) directed its concerns to the Diocese, claiming that it "want to shift costs to counsel" although the Council did not participate in hiring architects and performers sent to the site.
Part of the parish also complains of a lack of transparency on the side of the diocese.
Rekin hurt a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California
The authorities reported that last Saturday the shark attacked and hurt a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas, United States.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he dived with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard a call for help. Immediately with a group of friends, they came to the boy to help get him out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first he thought the boy was excited to catch a lobster, but soon he realized that the child screamed: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
After reaching the scene of Chad Hammel’s event, he noticed that the boy had completely crushed his skin in the area of the obsobula.
“I started screaming to everyone to flee from the water: “In the water is shark!” — Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Children's Hospital in San Diego. His condition was defined as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, the lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, said that the fish had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but it was considered that it was not a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered severe damage to the upper body.
In order to investigate and for safety reasons, the authorities have closed for 48 hours access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad until Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noticed that more than 135 shark species live in the area, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's network plans to expand activity on the British cosmetic market
The Sainsbury's Network throws a glove to shops such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing into its supermarkets cosmetic department, which refers to the style of goods houses, as well as specially trained sellers.
In the context of a significant investment in the UK cosmetic market, which is worth £2.8 billion and is constantly developing despite the declines in the fashion industry and household goods – 11 network stores will appear to be larger racks with cosmetic products. If the initiative is successful next year, the action will be extended to further points.
Return to the cosmetic industry stems from the search for ways of managing space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's network will double the number of cosmetic products and offer up to 3 thousand articles. In the range for the first time, goods such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw will appear.
Currently sold articles of brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and separate areas close to those known even from Boots shops.
Furthermore, the supermarket network plans to refresh its offer for Boutique make-up products. From now on most of the articles will be acceptable to vegan, which is increasingly demanding by younger customers.
In addition, the perfum Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first one opened last week in Croydon, southern London, and the second rise in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The universality of online sales and daily purchases of small amount of food in local shops makes supermarkets more encouraging customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, President of Sainsbury's, said that points of sales will be increasingly like goods houses because the network is trying to fight discounts such as Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's placed Argos network points in hundreds of stores and introduces a number of Habitat network points since both companies took over two years ago. According to the company this helps increase the sales of foodstuffs and increase the profitability of investments.
The previous attempt to reorganise chapters with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals ended with failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century Sainsbury's created a joint venture company with Boots. However, cooperation was concluded following a conflict of income sharing from supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduces a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £25 million three years ago.
According to reports, Lloyds will contribute to the plan by introducing an extended range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four network stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Director of Commercial Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance and character of cosmetics departments to improve customer interest.
We have invested in special training courses for colleagues so that they can help consumers during their purchases.
Our brands are able to meet all needs and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to attract attention to customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the way shopping has been made."
Peter Jones "murder" after having withdrawn Holly Willoughby from a contract worth £11 million
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Day television program, was "murdering" when he found out that Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from £11 million worth of lifestyle brand to focus on new collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household articles called Truly.
The activity was often compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure through Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave a successful lifestyle brand and focus on new cooperation with Marks & Spencer and ITV was made by Holly Willoughby, the star of Dragons' Day.
As the sources report, Peter Jones was "murder" when the popular TV presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his Marlow business empire, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to £1.5 million would not have time to devote to their March offering accessories and household articles of Trula.
The company was compared earlier to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow. It was also intended to double Holly Willoughby's assets, estimated at £11 million.
Following the announcement of a decision to leave Truly by a 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram Peter Jones left Great Britain to go to one of his summer homes.
“ Mark Truly was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She tied her future to her and wanted to take care of her for several decades.
The decision to withdraw from the business was totally surprised by all the parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday.
In Marlow warehouse, the goods are ready for sale."
Experts consider that giving up this Morning program and one of the most successful stars in the UK can cost millions of pounds due to significant investment in products – including articles from cane to household clothes and articles – and will result in further delays in entering the market.
It may also mean the end of long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (the mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin for ten years had close relations with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Holly Willoughby, together with Tara Capp, founded a brand Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them as president in March.
The couples spent their vacation together, and Jones involved 40% of the shares in the production of a TV company owned by Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is to become M&S Ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity program at the ITV station.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business affairs."
A difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love with each other"
The president was joking about the media criticism caused by the comment made, which some considered to be "unpreparable husband of the state", as well as a positive relationship with the leaders of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a mocking voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
"What I haven't given up."
The President pointed out that Kim Jong Un was interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was shouted by Trumpa a major step towards the deuklarisation of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are delayed.
After more than three months from the Singapore June summit, the head of Ri Yong Ho's North Korean diplomacy told global leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that they did not see an “analogical response” from the United States for early North Korea to disarm.
He noticed that instead of this, the United States is maintaining sanctions and pressing pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We deal with North Korea well," he said.
"We fought a war against North Korea.
Millions would die.
Now we have great relationships."
The president said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim Jong Unem have brought positive results: they have led to the end of rocket trials, helped free hostages and return to the other American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim Jong Un.
"It is easy to behave after the presidency. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to a crowded stadium we would have 200 people here," said Trump, showing the fingers of the crowd gathered directly ahead of us.
The tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed one of the islands by killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake on Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that no help was needed.
Despite the loss of the roof over the head of more than 10% of Lomboku population, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for speeding up the efforts of international aid.
"In many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they do not demand international support, so the situation is difficult," Selina Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is preparing to travel to Palu Indonesia, it is not certain yet that international staff can operate at the site of the event.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Pala to see if international organisations should be allowed to assist.
In the face of shocks that are constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although shelters have been built in the province of Aceh in the event of tsunami, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Pala – despite warning – probably had an impact on the number of deaths.
Even under the most favourable conditions, traveling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural clogs make logistics even harder.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on Lombok Island, is intended to assist the victims of earthquakes in the city of Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach the destination.
President Joko Widodo made improvements to Indonesian infrastructure the main point of his campaign and spent a lot of funds on the roads and railway lines.
However, in the face of next year's elections, the President's administration is struggling with a lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo was under pressure due to the persistent tensions in the country with religious foundations. Members of most Muslim communities accepted a more conservative form of faith.
Over a thousand people died, and tens of thousands of inhabitants lost their roof over their heads as a result of battle between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, arches, arrows and other simple weapons on the streets.

"I noticed Kanty approaching, took the ball, and shot without even thinking."
Chelsea ran the 1-0 game in the middle of the Belgian gate of Eden Hazarda shot at the 25th minute.

Cromwell's monument to the British Parliament is the last victim in the dispute on "the writing of history again"
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the reminders of the Taliban’s actions to destroy many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, Australian supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as a “murder” and “trying to write history again”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society Association, said: “Since the current debate on the removal of memorials, Oliver Cromwell’s dispute against the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
In the course of English domestic war, painting activities were neither commissioned nor ordered by Cromwell.
Perhaps his ancestor Thomas had a predetermined age to punish it not Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell on the monument shows what an opinion enjoyed this policy in the 19th century and that for many people it is worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in an interview for The Sunday Telegraph: “For many people Cromwell was perceived – perhaps more often in the 19th century than today – for the defender of Parliament against external pressures.
The assessment of how fitting this statement is is is to be the subject of continuous historical debate.
However, it is certain that the conflict of the mid - 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as Lord of the Protector also deserve to be taught and remembered."
In China, there was a fatal poisoning of a farmer by a pig.
As the local media report, there was a fatal attack on a farmer at the market in the southwest of China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bloody and with a disintegrated artery near the pigs in the Liupanshui market in Kuejczou Province.
The pig hunter is being prepared for vaccination in the pigs, on 30 May 2005, the city of Xining, in Qinghai Province (China).
According to reports, the man arrived at the market with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, my cousin found a man's body, and he noticed an open door to a nearby pighole.
He said there was a lot of blood fervent in the lymphoma.
The body section confirmed that it was close to 250-kilogram pig that killed the farmer.
"My cousin's feet were bloody and steered," said the man named Wu quoted by Guyang Evening News.
We can see from the surveillance footage that Yuan arrived at the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't Yuan or his cousin.
The manager of the trade fair said in an interview for the Guiyaang Evening News service that, at the time of collecting evidence by the police, the pros were isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the men's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for death.
Cases of pigs on humans have already been reported, although they are rare.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered fatal wounds.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, almost 300-kilogram pig brought a farmer into a tractor. Men's wife managed to pull an animal away.
After eating a farmer from Oregon by pigs in 2012 one of the farmers in Manitobie said that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can release brutal behavior in them.
"They just want to have fun.
They're like, they're as hot as kids... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the right respect," he said.
The leaves after the hurricane Rosa will cause intense rainfall in the southwestern part of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is losing its strength, moving over the colder waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days it will cause intense rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States.
The Huragan Rosa Towers at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the category 1 was given to him. It was then 620 km to the south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Well, according to the forecast on Sunday, Rosa's going north.
Meanwhile, on the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form rather than headed east to the western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will be approaching the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the mass of moist air north to the southwestern United States.
Monday will bring precipitation up to 25 cm in Mexico.
In the following days, wet tropical air entering contact with the approaching floods of rain in the south of the United States.
In some places, precipitation from 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden floods, movement of pollutants and possible dryings on desert areas.
Moisturised tropical air will cause some precipitation from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour, especially for parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even from 5 to 10 cm of rain is foreseen in some parts of the South West of the United States, especially over a large part of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical precipitation, sudden flooding and rapid changes in conditions can be possible.
In view of the danger of tropical rain, it is strongly advised to move on foot to desert territory.
The massive rainstorms can change the canyons in the river's river, and storms with lightning will cause local spooky winds and dust movement.
Coming before it brings a massive local rainfall on the southern coast of California.
Rains with a total height of 1.3 cm are possible, which may cause minor movement of pollutants and dangers in the roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region so far.
Late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and Tuesday, precipitation will occur in more areas.
On Tuesday, the vast rains of the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States will last until Wednesday.
In October, with cooling in the Arctic region throughout the United States, temperature fluctuations may occur. However, in the interversal zone it will be rather warm.
This can lead to a rapid change in temperatures at small distances.
A good example is Sunday's temperature differences in the middle of the States.
Between Kansas City (stan Missouri) and Omaha (State of Nebraska) and between St. Louis (stan Missouri) and Des Moines (the state of Iowa) these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, still summer temperatures can grow again.
The temperature should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the southern part of the Great Equals to the North East.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach a value of up to 27 degrees Celsius, about 5 degrees above the average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high likelihood of excessive temperatures in the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people were watching Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation.
More than 20 million people saw six TV stations moving Thursday's hearing at the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accusing a lawyer about sexual harassment taking place in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political deadlock on Friday, commentators had to stop regularly broadcast programs in order to inform of the sudden return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly prosecution investigation.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate's judicial committee that she was 100% certain that Kavanaugh was squeezing her in the state of being sober and trying to take off her clothes during a high school event.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that the situation had not occurred.
It is possible that the five number of TVs was even greater than that given by Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company has calculated the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC television stations.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network there were no figures available yet.
In addition, Nielsen tends to be difficult to measure the visibility of people in workplaces.
The number given is similar to that of the American football Cup game or the award of the American Film Academy.
According to reports, Nielsen Fox News Channel Station, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the highest observation rate. It produced on average 5.69 million viewers during the 24-day hearing.
The second place is the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2,52 million.
The subject concerned remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake has become a key figure of five events.
In the morning, he was captured by the CNN and CBS cameras after the fact that this moderate Republican office made a statement that he decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. In the recording he screams at the protesters who made it difficult for him to enter the elevator on the way to the hearing of the judicial committee.
Flake, with his head dropped out for a few minutes, listened to illegitimate opinions, and the whole event was broadcast by CNN station.
“I stand here before you and ask.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
You have the strength of so many women in the face of violence," he said.
Before the elevator door closed, Jeff Flake said that his office issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak during the hearing of the committee.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast events pending the vote on the transfer of Kavanaugh's nomination before the entire senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination if he knew the FBI was going to investigate the charges in the next week, as the Democrats insisted.
The Flakes convinced some of their conversations with their friend, Senator Chris Conons from the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting Chris Cons and some other senators.
The choice of Flake was important because the Republicans would not have had the votes necessary to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump opened the case of accusations against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for their own benefit
In an interview given to the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of leaving the European Union to play the future of Great Britain and undermine national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May is coming to the Consumer Party Conference in Birmingham (Great Britain), September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to Theresa May on the title page, former Minister of Foreign Affairs in her Government Boris Johnson attacked the plan for a future relationship with the European Union following the Brexit that the United Kingdom and the EU could take duties on their behalf, calling him "a whole of the ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: the police arrested Dytheon Simpson suspect for the murder of an LSU player.
Police arrested the suspect in connection with the deadly shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana (LSU).
According to reports from Baton Rouge Police Command, the 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was detained and arrested for second-degree murder.
The authorities have published a record of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police have informed that during the fight, Sims lost his glasses.
According to reports from CBS, WAFB's station police officers found these glasses on site and found traces of Simpson's DNA on them.
The police informed Simpson after the interview that he confessed to shooting Wayde.
As the defendant's lawyer informed, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report showing that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to head and neck.
The police commissioner expressed her thanks to a group of searchers at Louisiana State Police, a state police crime lab, Southern University police and nearby residents for helping with an arrest investigation.
Joe Alleva, Director of Sports LSU, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for "working and seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm man grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played basketball in LSU.
In his last season he recorded a mean of 5.6 points and 2.6 games for the match.
On Friday morning, basketball coach from LSU Will Wade said that the team is "happled up" and "crowred" by Wayde's death.
"This is one of the things we are constantly afraid of," said Will Wade.
Ash emitted by volcano reach the city of Mexico
The ashes extracted from the volcano Popocatépetl reached the southern districts of Mexico.
On Saturday, the national disaster prevention centre advised Mexican citizens of approaching volcano due to an increase in activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The Centre has recorded numerous pride and shocks.
The photos published in social media show the front glass of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in the areas of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Since the earthquake of 7.1 degree strength, which has been visited by Mexico in September 2017, geophysics have recorded an increase in volcano activity of 72 km southeast of the capital of the country.
The Vulcan also known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Oldness of police with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of the old protestors supporting the independence of Catalonia with the preventive police troops. On that day, thousands of people took part in hostile demonstrations reminiscing the first anniversary of the extreme emotions of the referendum on the nobody else's secession.
A group of masked proponents dumped the eggs and powder paint police officers. Dark clouds of dust usually made the streets full of tourists.
The old age also occurred in the late part of the day. In order to stop the fighting, police forces used a bat.
For a few hours, groups that supported independence were “We do not forget, we do not forgive” and “Let Spain live.”
According to the local press, fourteen people received medical assistance in connection with minor injuries suffered during protests.
A year after the referendum of October 1st, the tension does not weaken, although the authorities in Madrid find it illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate for the year's desire for the Catalans' secession.
The majority voted in favour of independence, however, the frequency was low because of the wide-ranging boycott of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost a thousand people suffered injuries last year in brutal olds with police trying to prevent vote in electoral sites.
On Friday night, the group of people who supported the region decided to prevent demonstrations supporting policemen.
The demonstration took place despite this, but a change of the route has been forced.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electricist, together with his wife, involved in the protest of separatists, said that there was no hope of independence of Catalania anymore.
“ Last year we survived one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents were happy to vote, but now we are stuck at a point without leaving," he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the local elections last December, parties supporting the Catalan secession have difficulties in continuing their actions. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or await the trial in connection with the role played in the referendum and later announcement of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old mechanic recording the protests supporting the police, said politicians on both sides of the dispute are strengthening the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders held in custody since the end of last year, declared the wish to launch in the next year's elections to the European Parliament.
"Candication in elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of the democratic values of the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after driving in the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested following a multiple hit by a car in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 British Time (BST).

At some point in the direction of the car, the arrow could also be fired from the piece.
The Mengi Gate provides the Livingston Win over the Rangers 1:0
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought the team victory
Since this season, the Livingston Club has been playing for the Rangers in stunned by putting Steven Gerrard in his 18 games as coach of the Ibrox Park Club.
Dolly Menga's gate was won, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table with Hibernian.
Gerrard's command team remains in this season without winning the Premiership. The team will face the leader of Hearts, to which eight points are lost in next Sunday.
Previously on Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA League of Europe.
Livingston extended a series of victories in his division to six matches. Coach Holt failed to replace Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed several opportunities against undisposed opponents
Holt's team should have been running a lot earlier, because the team's game brought many problems to the Rangers.
First Scott Robinson crashed through the defense and shot him in the light of the gate, but he failed to shoot the goal. Then Alan Lithgow did not get to take over Craig Halket's head.
The engineers allowed the Rangers to play closer goals, knowing that they could threaten the rivals during the regular parts of the game.
And that's how the determining gate fell.
After the Rangers fired, the Livingston team found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the situation of Menga, which won the goal from the middle of the penalty field.
At this stage the Rangers had more possessions, but they couldn't disarm the hosts and they didn't have any problems with Liam Kelly's goalkeeper.
Alfredo Morelos fired one shot at Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's attempt was fired by the Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow could not reach the light of the gate from the next permanent portion of Livingston.
The Rangers continued to attack in Livingston's criminal field, but they could not take advantage of the situation. Two penalty shots after Halketta's intervention against the Glen Middleton variable and one hand played. However, both of them were rejected.
"Fenomenal" of Livingston's performance – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and results for Livingston.
He thought they played great, once again going beyond expectations.
Their style and composition almost did not change from returning to extraclasses. However, Holt should be appreciated to motivate the team to play.
The sword had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a great organized defense, while Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very careful throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked their will to fight.
Although they have great moments under Gerrard, they did not maintain their standards in the match.
There was something missing in their game: only once managed to break through the defense of the host. It should be a serious warning to the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
During a Saturday’s breakfast in Berlin (29 September) to the leaders of Turkey and Germany accompanied the smiles and beautiful weather.
It was the last day of the controversy of President Erdogan's visit to Germany. Visits were intended to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
There have been differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and accession of Turkey to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turks out of its homeland.
As the police reported, 25 thousand crowds were blocked for security reasons, gathering before the temple. However, the presidents gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of opponents Erdogan, including many Kurds, also decided to express their opinion, condemning Turkey's leadership policy and the German government's decision to adopt policies in the country.
The protests contrast with the divisions that the visit was made by a politician called hero by some of the Turks living in Germany and considered autocratic by others.

Sudden floods caused by Hurricane Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible positive impact on dry areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach Arizona state. It is likely that it will happen in the beginning of next week. The remains after the hurricane Rosa are moving on deserted areas of the South West, causing a threat of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning on the possibility of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, South East California, and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast on Tuesday Rosa will go straight to Phoenix, rain will begin on Monday afternoon.
Phoenix National Weather Service reported that “just ten tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) reached a distance of 65 km from the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation of between 5 and 10 cm. In some areas Momollon Rim in Arizona can reach a height of up to 15 cm.
In the remaining desert areas of the South West, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Church, the height of precipitation is likely to be between 2.5 and 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
People outside the areas at risk of sudden floods of precipitation accompanied by hurricane Rosa can bring relief because the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the precipitation will improve the situation in the South West, where drought is at stake.
According to the weather.com portal, U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of the Arizona area is struggling with the touching droughts of the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa will reach the California peninsula in Mexico first.
On Sunday morning Rosa continued to travel with the hurricane force, reaching a speed of 137 km/h. Currently it is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is headed north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane encounters the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, which causes its weakening.
According to the forecasts, Mexico will strike with a force of tropical storm on Monday afternoons or evenings.
Heavy rains in some parts of Mexico may pose a major flood risk.
The portalweather.com reported that “in the area from the California Peninsula to the north-west of Sonora, precipitation is estimated at 7 to 15 cm, although it is possible to reach 25 cm.”
The hurricane Rosa will then pass through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in early morning hours, it will reach the border of Arizona as a tropical depression.
“The most serious threat caused by hurricane Rosa or its residues is the very heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the northwestern state of Sonora and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States,” says National Hurricane Center.
According to the forecast, rain will cause life-threatening floods and the movement of pollutants in the desert and mud fibers in the mountainous area.

Trump said that Brett Kavanaugh “abhorred and angry” the Democratic Party
"The voice dedicated to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the absolute and depraved procedure of the Democratic Party" said Trump in the Wheeling Tower, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh had “accepted the anger and anger” of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Congress, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christina Blasey Ford. A woman claims a few decades ago when they were both teenagers, a man committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the hearing about the charges she made.
On Saturday, the President said that “the Americans could learn about Kavanaugh’s brilliantness, class, and courage. ”
"The voice dedicated to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of the support of one of the most important lawyers of our time, the right to great merits for the community," said the Western Virginia envoy crowd.
The President did not directly refer to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, discussing the importance of the Republican frequency in half-presidency of the election presidency.
“The most important choices in our lives are five weeks apart.
I'm not running in these elections, but I'm staying very active," he said.
"I'm still fighting to defend our wonderful candidates."
Trump claims that Democrats have a policy of "resisting resistance and making business difficult".
As CNN said, one of the assistants of an important Republican Party policy, the first key senate vote on the Kavanaugh nomination is expected at the latest on Friday.
Hundreds of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
As the authorities died on Saturday, at least 384 people died – many of which were kidnapped by high waves breaking the beaches – following the strong earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the festival. At the dawn, the waves hit even 6 meters high, kidnapping many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of a 7.5 degree earthquake.
"When there was a threat yesterday, people on the beach did not escape immediately and they became victims of tsunami," said Sukop Purwo Nugro, spokesperson of the Indonesian natural disaster agency BNPD at the conference in Jakart.
“Tsunami attacked everything on its way, kidnapping cars, fences and houses,” said Nugroho. He then added that before reaching the coastline, the element moved at sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some saved themselves with a tree climb and managed to survive.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and destroyed bridges and mosques surrounded by water are seen in the aerial photos published by the disaster agency.
On Saturday, the coastal town visited secondary shocks.
A number of earthquakes occurred in the area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
According to the Declaration by the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPT), energy liberated by the vast Friday earthquake was about two hundred times the energy of the nuclear bomb dumped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement found that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could haveten the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that hundreds of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were sunk.
Then added that the body parts of the victims were found under the flooded buildings, 540 were injured, and 29 were found to be missing.
Nugroho said that deadly victims and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the epicentre of earthquakes.
According to Nugro, the communication "was completely paralysed", so there are no reports from Donggala Province.
“The population there is over 300 thousand” — read the Red Cross statement. It also added that employees and volunteers of organisations will go to places affected by the disaster.
“We can now talk about tragedy, although the situation may be worsening,” says the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with widespread criticism due to the lack of information about the tsunami in Palu. However, the authorities said that the waves occurred just after the issue of a warning.
On the amateur recording available in social media, there is a man who screams from the building, trying to warn about the coming tsunami of the person on the street.
Within a few minutes, the water wall crashed by the shore, kidnapping buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm immediately the authenticity of the recording.
Earthquakes and tsunami have caused significant electricity shortages, preventing communication within the Palae. This in turn has made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still need food and other essential articles of the first need.
The airport is only open to humanitarian transport. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is to visit the centres for evacuated people in Palu.
More than 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As Doseba T. Sinay, the national director of the World Vision, reported, the staff of this organization arrived safely from Donggala Province to Palu and found refuge in the tents of the bresent on the courtyard of the office. On the way, the workers passed many havoc areas.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some groups slowly start providing assistance, there have been criticisms that workers of foreign humanitarian organisations with extensive experience are prevented from travelling to Pal.
According to the Indonesian right to receive funding, resources and personnel from abroad, it is only possible to start after the site of disaster is declared a national disaster.
It's not done yet.
"We are officially facing a regional disaster," said the Advocate of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government considers that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to take international aid, but this is not yet the case."
Two days after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami in Pala, friends and families of the missing people still hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves in the midst of destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who spent two days under rubbles beside her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian Parallel Association, trained two missing paratroopers participating in the US games finished this month in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandagi said, other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
“As a experienced parallelter, I am struggling with my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon Subandono announced that during a few hours after the arrival of information on the collapse of the Roa Roa desperate hotel, he sent messages to athletes taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of a couple of hooks in blue color.
"I think this means that the messages have not been provided," he said.

Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West has decided to change his name to Ye.
When reporting his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The person previously known as Kanye West.
Fourteen-year-old musician has been using pseudonym Ye for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change took place before a visit to Saturday Night Live. It is expected that during the performance the artist will present his new album, "Yandhi".
He will join in the program by singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creators, resigned for “for emotional reasons.”
West has already stated that the word "Ye" is not only a short cut from his present artistic adventure but is of religious importance.
“I think that “yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Scriptures it means “Ty””” – said West during the previous period of the year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter named Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all of our good, bad and confusing qualities.
The album shows who we are."
West was part of other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known under Puff Daddy's pseudonyms, P. Diddy or Diddy announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West co-worker, also saved his pseudonym in various ways, with a liaison, without a liaison, and great letters.
President of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador commits not to use troops against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression of students, President of the Mexico Elector of Andrés Manuel López Defador (AMLO) committed himself never to use troops against civilians.
On Saturday, in the square of Three Kultur López Obrador, he promised “always not to use the army to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers opened fire on the square in the direction of peaceful demonstrations, killing up to 300 people.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexican people, providing monthly financial assistance to learners, as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunity to teach young boys to criminal groups.
The United States should double funding research into artificial intelligence
As Kai-Fu Lee says, the investor and artist of artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, together with increasing China's activity in this area, should double the expenditure on SI research.
The comments made relate to the announcements on artificial intelligence published by various US government agencies, although the US does not have an official strategy for SI.
However, last year China presented their plan, according to which they want to be the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The research budget for SI should be doubled first: all other countries are far beyond the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area" said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview this week, the CNB also said that doubled funds could double the chances of another breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpovers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, President of Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most significant companies dealing with artificial intelligence in China, known as Face++.
In the 1980 ’ s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University for the creation of an SI system, which defeated the best American player in Otello’s play. He then held managership in Microsoft Research and was the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the success of earlier technological initiatives of the U.S. Government, e.g., organised by the Agency of Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Area (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the deadline for another edition of the struggle, because he thought it would help to find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, researchers in the United States often have to do their best to receive government subsidies.
“It is not China that takes away the best representatives of the academic community, but corporations” said Lee.
For several years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States develop SI.
"I consider that those who are dealing with artificial intelligence who have received doctoral degree should automatically grant a green card," he said.
In July 2017 the Chinese State Council published the plan to create an artificial intelligence of the next generation.
As Lee, the Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences (National Natural Science Foundation of China), has shown, in a way similar to the American National Foundation for Science and Other Government Organisations awarding funds to American scientists. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
In the earlier period of this year, the U.S. Defence Department set up a combined artificial intelligence centre (Joint Scientific Intelligence Center), which will engage in the work of partners from the industry and science world. The White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence (Select Committee on Scientific Intelligence).
In this month, DARPA also informed about putting USD 2 billion into an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests over 100 billion dollars per year in research on SI.
At the same time, the American initiative to set up a national committee on artificial intelligence has not gone a step forward for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of their country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum on the amendment of their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia. This movement would allow a few decades' dispute with Greece that blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where the historic land of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and therefore has taken part in joining the country in the EU and NATO.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the nomenclature, but nationalists claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavonic majority of Macedonian residing.
President Iwanow said he would not vote. A campaign encouraging boycott raised doubts about whether the frequency would reach a minimum level of 50% required to accept a binding referendum.
The referendum referred to the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of an agreement with Greece".
Followers of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, argue that it is worth paying the price for joining Macedonia – one of the countries that came after Yugoslavia's fall – to organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted in favour of the future of my country so that young people in Macedonia can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. Members in the EU will provide us with greater security"" said Oner Georgievski of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that it is applying the results of the vote.
The amendment of the name requires the support of two thirds of Parliament's members.
The national electoral committee has informed that no unusual events have been reported by 13 hours.
However, the turnout at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the recent 2016 parliamentary elections. At that time 66% of the persons entitled gave up their vote.
"I voted in favour of my children. Our place is in Europe" said 62-year-old Tanzewski, election candidate from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018 in Struica, Macedonia, Prime Minister of Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and Duško gave their vote in a referendum on the change of country name to open the way for NATO and European Union membership.
In front of Parliament's building in Skopje, Vladimir Kawardarkow prepared a small scene and set chairs before the tents distributed by the boycotting referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU's membership, but we want to join these organisations with their head-in-chief, not the back door," Kawardarkow said.
“We are poor countries, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can address other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaew claims that NATO will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, in which the unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will come forward with a change of name in the referendum, because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaew said after his vote.
He stated that the vote on "yes" was a "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute from 30 to 43% of voters declared their wish to participate in a referendum. This is less than the required frequency.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV, 57% of respondents are planning to vote in the Sunday referendum.
70% of the survey reports claimed that it would support a change of name.
To conclude the vote successfully, the turnout must be 50% + 1 vote.
The failure in the referendum would be the first serious blow in the pro-Western government policy since last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City beats the entire Brighton defense and gets the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent back to Brighton's house in Saturday's meeting with the result of 2-0 for Manchester City. The Mecz was played at Etihad Stadium in Manchester (English).
The gate captured by Aguera in 65 minutes looked like a child's easy.
The action began with the application in the centre of the field to the Argentinian attacker.
The football player beat three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was among the four Brighton players.
First, he lost one of them, and then he ran over the rest, and he was on the edge of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he played the ball to the left where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English assailant immediately gave the ball back to Aguera in a criminal field, which defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's goalkeeper with a shot on the right side of the gate.
“Aguiro is dealing with foot trauma” said the journalists coach Manchester City Pep Guardiola.
“We discussed the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to have won a goal at that time."
However, Sterling provided the blue first lead in the Premier League duel.
The gate in question fell in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero received a ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent great mention along the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move on to the far poles.
Manchester City's assailant sent the ball to the grid just before she got off on cars.
Manchester City will meet Hoffenheim in the UEFA Group League on Tuesday 12:55. The meeting will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Shecher wants to spoil the chances of the Rockies victory.
After losing the chance to participate in the playoff phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer, he did not have to be the first member.
However, the loving rivalry of Scherzer hopes to be in a Sunday meeting against Colorado Rockies if only Rockies retain the chances of performing in the playoff phase. Currently, the team has one more win than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
Rockies can count at least on a wild card if they win a Friday meeting against the Nationals with a result of 5:2. They still want to get their first title as division champion.
“Among the fact that we play “nothing”, at least we go out to the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of opponents will be the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in this meeting."
The Nationals have not yet announced the launcher for the Sunday meeting. However, the team is inclined to exhibit Scherera in its first composition.
It would be the thirty-quarter performance of Scherera in the first composition. He took part in Thursday's dart training and hopes to take place on Sunday.
The team's right-hand fighter from Washington recorded 18-7 results and ERA 2.53.300-fold eliminated batons and scored 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trumpa in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh at the judge of the Supreme Court, discussing the importance of the frequency of Republicans per half of the election presidency.
"In November, we put all the achievements we have achieved so far.
We have been sharing five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I am not taking off, I am staying very active. I am constantly defending our wonderful candidates," he said.
He continued: “We have to deal with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions with our own eyes.
They are determined to take control of all means, and they are mean and mean.
They don't care who they hurt and who they have to hurt to get power and control.
As he said, the Democrats are implementing the mission of "resisting resistance and hindering activities".
“It has been very well seen in the last four days” said he, calling Democrats “bad, mean, unfaithful, and unrighteous.”
The President referred to the Senate Court of Justice by referring to the name and surname of the American Senator of the Democratic Party Dianne Feinstein, who met with a loud bang from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the document leak?
«Uch, am I listening?
No... that means... no». Her body language was bad. It was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a grouping of people of different views.
The Party is intolerant to those who express their own opinions
When Momentum activists in my party voted for my impeccable award, I was not surprised.
Finally, I am a member of the Labour Party Group, recently told that they are not welcome, and all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with a similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the proposal for a naked person was based on the difference between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. As to the irony of fate, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
On Friday's announcement about the meeting of the Labour Party parliamentarians from Nottingham East District, you could read: "We want the meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years I had done my work as a member of the Labour Party, the majority of the five-day meetings of the General Committee looked like this.
Unfortunately, at present many meetings are different: it has long been forgotten about the promise of a more “slighter and milder” policy, as long as it has ever been remembered.
It is increasingly obvious that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is assessed in respect of compliance with the management of the party.
It all began shortly after the President's position of Jeremy Corbyn. Colleagues, in which I thought we had similar views, began to expect me to change direction and to take positions with which I would not agree earlier, such as national security or the EU single market.
After every public speech – regardless of the content – I meet in social media with attacks calling for nominations, condemnation of centralism or leaving the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because my attention is rather political.
I admire professionalism and the determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of today's policy is to move to the agenda with insulting others.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should support the culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a grouping of people of different views. With each application for “the fruit of distrust” and every change in the rule of choice of the worldview of the party is narrowed.
In the last two years, I have been repeatedly suggested not to bend out and excuse certain things, and then everything would be "right".
This is not why I took care of politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the negligence of the Margaret Thatcher government, which led to the collapse of my school class, I am trying to ensure better quality of public service for those in need – both as a local councilman and as a minister.
I've never covered my beliefs, including my last election campaign.
Everyone in the Nottingham East district knew my position and knew the differences between the party authorities.
To those who supported the Friday proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the president of the Lambuds against the coming Brexit, which would harm domestic farms, businesses and public services.
But I am proud to serve you. I promise that no threats of withdrawal of nominations or legal political objectives will discourage me in accordance with my convictions and in the best interest of you all.

Ayr v. Melrose 38:17 – undefeated Ayr up again
But there's no doubt that Ayr's team deserved a win in this very interesting Scottish extraligion game.
The team's first in the table and remains the only troubled team.
In the end, this outstanding defense and a better use of opportunities led the team to win. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his support.
"The games so far have been a challenge for us, but we are still inconceivable, so I am happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose’s team said: “It is time to pay respect to Ayr’s players.
Ayr went on to lead in 14th minute after Grant Anderson and raised Frazier Clima. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes, who came to the band from Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to match the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an untapped chance of increasing.
Climo increased the drive of Ayr after the kick from the penalty jet just before the end of the first half. First he got the assignment, and then he took advantage of the opportunity to increase, obtaining a score of 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half well. Patrick Anderson's addition increased by Baggot to five points.
Then there was a longer game suspension due to the serious injury of Ruaridha Knott. The player was removed from the field on his feet. After the resumption Ayr increased the lead after the Stafford McDowall was put on and Clima increased.
In the subsequent procedure, Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow card. Melrose again used his number: putting on an untapped sample of Bruce Colvin's uplifting.
The hosts took over the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for punching Climate without a ball. MacPherson got a hold on his back approaching his defense.
Climo took advantage of the chance to raise the score. He then managed to increase the score just after the game was resumed when Kyle Rowe got shot from the penalty shot and enabled Gregor Henry's wingman to get the fifth assignment for the host.
Still Game series star starts a career in the gastronomic industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems to be starting out in the gastronomy industry, recently discovered to be the director of the restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC network. He performs and co-creates a series together with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the ninth season would be the last in the history of the series. Everything indicates that Ford Kranan is planning the future after leaving the "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became director of Adriftcorn Limited.
An actor refused to comment on this subject, although informant Scottish Sun suggested that Kranan was trying to engage in the “rising gastronomy” in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": without access to the sea of Bolivia, hope that the court will once again open its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the area of the Navy base at La Paz.
The public buildings have blue flags.
In the ports of the Navy from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the following motto is seen: “The sea is ours under the law.
Its recovery is our duty."
In the absence of access to the sea, Bolivia's memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources from the 19th century is still alive.
These hopes are perhaps the largest in decades. Bolivia expects judgment of the International Court of Justice. It is to be issued on 1 October following a five-year trial.
"Bolivia's works are in dissipated, and the inhabitants are unanimous, optimistic, and they count on a positive verdict," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will be together to see the International Court of Justice meeting. They hope that the organisation based in The Hague will recognise Bolivia's claim and after decades of fruitless talks Chile will have to negotiate the granting of independent access to the sea.
Eva Morales, President of Bolivia's charismatic Charismatic President, who will be able to compete next year for the counter-review, also has hope on Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts claim that the chances of a judgment favourable to Bolivia are small and that even a favourable decision would change a little.
The United Nations body based in The Hague has no power to grant Bolivia Chile. He also warned that it would not affect any discussions.
As Paz Zárate, a Chinese international law specialist, said, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be delivered six months after the final arguments were presented.
For the last four years, Bolivia has been unable to distance the country from its destination.
"The questions of access to the sea have been captured by the current Bulgarian administration" said Mr. Paz Zárate.
Morales' inconclusive rhetoric deprived the Chileans of any other goodwill, suggestive.
Bolivia and Chile are going to resume the conversation at some point, but it will be very difficult to face the situation.
Both countries have not been replaced by ambassadors since 1962.
Mr Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in the Hague, did not agree with the opinion that the court decision-making process was extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "the unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the possibility of "the end of a 139-year-old dispute period with reference to mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied the fact that Morales — still one of the most popular Latin American presidents — had used the subject of access to the sea as part of a political game.
"Bolia will never waive the right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an excellent opportunity to believe that we must deal with the past."
The North Koreans claim that nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, states that his nation will never be rid of nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore Summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared at the time when the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seemed to be on the verge of resumption of suspended nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that "frozen" is, as if the lack of sanctions and opposition by the US to a declaration ending the Korean war has ever thrown North Korea to its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign a declaration without prior adoption by Pyongyang of concrete disarmament measures.
Both Kim Jong Un and President of USA Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread scepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is seriously going to end the arsenal that is perceived in North Korea as the only means to guarantee security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows bring together the latest line of big ones to cover their heads in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely cover yourself before the sun, we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy, overdimensional headgears included in their 2019 summer collection, which were dazzling in style during the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats were up on Instagram this summer. These designers decided to present their stunning prognosis.
Valentino’s outstanding work was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathered jacket flooding model head.
Other cross-dimensional accessories included arbuds decorated with jewels, a wizard hat, and even ananasa — but they were not designed to heat their head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of peculiar masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had covered their mouths and looked more like Hannibal Lecter's style than haute couture.
One creature looked like diving equipment with tubing and glasses, and another looked like hot ice cream.
And if you don't want to break up with great fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats can go to clothes stores.
Non-dimensional hats follow the “La Bomba”, a famous hat with a wide range of 61 cm of rondem, all of whom have already worn – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A cultural brand standing behind this extremely impractical hat, which flew through social media, presented another great creation on the run — a famous beach bag almost as big as the one wearing it in the bathing suit.
The heated orange bag of reefs, finished with reefs and raised with white leather handle, was distinguished in the Jacquemus La Rivier collection for summer 2019 during the Paris Fashion Week week.
Luke Armitage, the stylist of the stars, said FEMAIL: “I am afraid that big hats and beach bags will appear in stores next summer — because the designer managed to exert such a great influence, it would be difficult not to use demand for over-dimensional accessories.”
John Edward: the linguistic skills needed for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements – in 2018 they were able to commend themselves with another excellent test result, supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other social activities.
Presented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) of schools attended by more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, they aim to provide the best level of services to students and parents.
Schools are independent in order to prepare students for further and higher education, their career path and to indicate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the opportunity to develop and implement a learning programme tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to another man in the language he understands, then it goes to his head.
If you're speaking to him in his own language, it'll go to his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot only rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that the languages take their first place in league rankings, with the highest rating rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who were learning foreign languages gained a higher grade A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS Member States showed that 72 percent of students received higher A rating in Mandarin, and 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also obtained A grade.
This shows that schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the necessary skills, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language learning, as an object of choice, is conducted in the same respect as the STEM study (a science of strict, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the framework of education programmes in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey of 2014 carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission (UK Commission) showed that the employer’s 17% lack of linguistic skills of candidates was responsible for the difficulties in imposing job opportunities.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to allow young people to start their careers.
These skills are needed in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring language skills,
Lifelong learning as a second language will provide a great advantage in the future — regardless of the path of professional development.
The ability to communicate directly from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person towards competition.
According to YouGov's 2013 survey, in which more than 4000 British adults participated, 75% of them could not speak in a foreign language well enough to talk, and the French language was the only language with which the percentage of those using was two-digit, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investing in foreign languages is so important for today's children.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular developing languages, will provide children with greater opportunities to find suitable employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in languages taught in it.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered essential to the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose which will be taught by specialised staff in this area.
Scotland’s schools are independent in creating a teaching environment that will prepare children and keep them in the skills needed to make success — regardless of what the future is for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment languages are still crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as "international communication skills".
Schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a great choice, diversity and level.
It's just the way it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Debjut LeBron on a Lakers team Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who want to see LeBron James debut in Los Angeles Lakers have finally arrived.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that LeBron James would play the Sunday pre-zone match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one but less than 48", said Walton on the official website of the Lakers team.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell, on Twitter, announced that James is likely to play a full number of minutes.
After the training that took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-zone Lakers matches.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to take part in pre-zone games to prepare," he said.
So, you know, Trump, West Virginia, YouTube channel.
President Donald Trump launches a series of election towers at Wheeling in Virginia tonight.
It's the first of the five planned Trumpa electoral towers to take place next week, along with attitudes in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming the suspension of his choice to hold his position at the Supreme Trump Court, he is committed to building support in the upcoming elections in the half-term of the government, as the Republicans may threaten to lose control of Congress when the votes are handed over in November.
What time will be held tonight, so Trump's Western Virginia voters and where will it be possible to view it on the Internet?
So, today will take place at 7 p.m. in Wheeling, West Virginia, which is Saturday, September 29, 2018.
So you can follow Trumpa on YouTube live online in Western Virginia.
Trump will likely speak about this week's hearings by the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, which took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with the allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour, as well as the expected vote in the Senate on suspension of the election for a maximum of one week, for the time being carried out by the FBI of the investigation.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral towers is to provide support to Republicans in the face of difficult November elections.
So President Trump's campaign with five towers next week is aimed at "mobilising volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives"—Reuters.
"The Congress control is such an important point in the President's timetable that, as the hottest season of the campaign comes up, it will visit as many states," said Trumpa, a spokesperson for the campaign who has not agreed to give his name — Reuters.
Today's election rally at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh” — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump visits West Virginia — the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help the Western Virginia candidate to the Senate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the polls.
“This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the President is coming to support him in polls”, said Simon Haeder, a political scientist from West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows a spirit of fighting, keeping hope of victory in Sunday singles
After three unilateral sessions, the format foursome held in Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating fluctuating fluctuation is a completely imaginary sporting concept, but one in which professionals really believe and the most on competitions like this.
So what's their dissipation like at this point?
"They've been at six points, and now they're only four, so I think we've got a little setback," Jordan Spieth said.
Of course, Europe has four points, while 12 are still present.
But Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind in sails and have worthy patterns to follow, especially in the form of Spiath and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each of them could boast three points from four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
The screams of the whole throat, which was a sign of excitement, became increasingly louder during the course of his round, turning around the key putt and winning the match when he and Thomas got two holes in two hits.
His reflection on the earth, which gave them victory with the result of the 15, has come to a similar cry — one that gives us the understanding that the American team is still in the game.
"It is enough to focus and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all that's left of each of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players who have gained more points over the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple of European bands won four of four and did not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't pay a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and lows on Friday mornings.
The way they play and how their energy seems to flow from both to and from the noisy crowd proves that they should be defeated by these players on Sundays, and that they do not have a better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, who could seal the potential victory of the European team on Le Golf National.
It would be best if they played at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about winning the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quick to play Sergio Gartí, the morning hero of the fourball when he was paired up with Alex Noren.
The bogey and double-deep on the front of the thread dug up the Spanish and Swede into a hole they would never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday to help get out of the hole.
The format of fourball and foursome are so fascinating because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe has played better so far as a team and has taken a significant advantage on the last day, but the foursome session has also shown that the U.S. team has an incision to fight in which some, especially in the United States, doubted.
Europe with the result of 10-6 covers the final day of Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning with the result of 10-6 Saturday matches fourball and foursome with the United States.
The inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — has dropped the gray one, bringing two victories over Tiger Woods, increasing its performance to Le Golf National for four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a small American team in the morning format of fourball, winning a series with a score of 3-1.
The United States faced a greater resistance in the format of foursome, winning two matches, but could not make losses.
To preserve the trophy, Jim Furyka's team has to score eight points with 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter to win four points in a row, while along with Molinarim (the band was called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) is just the second pair in Ryder Cup history, which won four points in four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a fourball format, they beat Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau, getting even more empathic 5&4.
Woods, who grew up for two Saturday matches, was occasionally shown by a flashy genius, but lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourball and foursome formats, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning format of fourball, returned to Henrika Stentsen as a foursome format to overcome the result of 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooxa Koepka, serving in the world ranking respectively, items 1 and 3.
However, the European team did not all come to mind in this pleasant, cold day on a field situated to the south of Paris.
Three times Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a reference point for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with the result of 2&1 over Spain by Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with the result of 4&3 in the format of foursome, losing two hole opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history happened to make the team a four-point loss, starting with singles, although Furyk's team would only have had a draw to preserve the trophy.
However, two days ago, Sunday’s counters seem unlikely.
North Korea says "stressably not" unilateral disarmament without trust.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday during the UN speech that the lack of abolition of sanctions would only exacerbate the lack of confidence of North Korea to the United States and there is no way that this country would give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the Annual General Assembly that North Korea took "significant means of goodwill" last year, such as the suspension of nuclear and rocket tests, the dismantling of nuclear test sites and the commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any specific answer from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security, and in such circumstances there is no one-sided disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints concerning Washington's willingness to take on a “step” approach to decarbonisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual action, his statement seemed to be significant because it did not reject unilateral deuclearisation, as had happened in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump on the first in the history of the summit between the President of the United States and the leader of North Korea, which took place on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un committed to working for the "decarbonisation of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised the security guarantees of North Korea.
North Korea expected the formal completion of the Korean war (the 1950–1953), but the US delegation announced that Pyongyang had to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also supported the call to mitigate the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insist on "deutralisation first" and increase pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a force, resisting even the signing of the "dedeclaration of the war," said Ri.
“The statement that sanctions can put us on our knees is that of the people who act ignorantly against us.
The problem, however, is that the absence of sanctions increases our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which he spoke about at the beginning of the week of the United States leader at the UN.
Instead, the Minister noted three meetings between Kim Jong Une and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months, and then added: "If the party on the issue of deuklarisation was South Korea, and not the United States, then there was no such impassion in the field of denuclarization of the Korean peninsula."
Mim this, the tone of speech Ri was completely different compared to last year, when he said it during the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea missiles in the United States is inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump (Mr Bad President Trump) called Kim Jong Una "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, which threatened to commit a “total destruction” of North Korea last year, praised Kim Jong Un for his courage to take action in disarmament, but he also said that there was still a lot of work to be put in place, and he said that until North Korea was deprived of nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be abolished.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not set the time interval for this, saying: “Although it will take two years, three years or five months, it does not matter.”
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the United Nations Security Council that: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue and remain constant until we find the full, final and verified dailyisation."
Since 2006, the Security Council unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea, trying to eliminate the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, after which in a few hours North Korea condemned him for “the setting of gangster demands”.
North Korea committed itself to this month's meeting with Moon Jae-in that it will disassemble the missile test site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes "the appropriate means".
He said that Kim Jong Un said that “the appropriate measures that he cares about are security guarantees that Trump has committed to Singapore, and to take steps to normalise his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are attending a course for appropriate long rest
The new Harvard University course, which took place this year, provided more sleep for all students, which was intended to combat the growing macho culture of learning through “all-night coffe-powered students”.
Students of academics from the best university in the world often have no idea of the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that is the first such in the United States.
It was inspired to create a course of speech on the impact of sleep-deprivation on science.
“ At the end of the speech, one girl came to me and said: “Why do you only call me now that I am at my last year of study? ”
She said that no one had ever told her the meaning of a dream that surprised me," said The Telegraph.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, it explains to students how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in learning and sport and improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Health, said that this course was decided to introduce after it was found that students suffered a severe sleep shortage within a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a room image in the dorm where students click coffee cups, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the effect of caffeine and light, and how sleep shortage affects sports results, as well as how important it is to maintain sleep regularity.
In another section, participants will learn how long-term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of campus with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change student behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know what the health effects of smoking with him” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride from "all night science" still exists, said, adding that modern technology and constantly growing pressure on students means an increasing problem of sleep failure.
The provision of a sufficient amount of good quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even allowing the absence of weight gain, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to pass into hunger mode, which makes the student constantly hungry,” he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop a course after he took part in one of his classes last year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press for the entire campus course.
The next step is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before going to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a reminder alarm when you need to go to sleep and when you need to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lighting, which can brighten the rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga is running Gerard's team
The Rangers once again suffered during a fight at the Livingston exit, when Dolly Menga, with his shot, led to a failure of Steven Gerrard's disassembled team, winning the 1-0 score.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to record its first victory from 4-1th in February on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games, causing his team to pay eight points in respect of Ladbrokes Premiership leader — Hearts.
Menga shot a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the composition of the Rangers showing lack of commitment did not seem to improve.
While Rangers recorded a fall to the sixth place, Livingston grew to third — just behind Hibernian with the loss of one goal.
The Rangers team may have further problems with the need to take care of the head of Judge Calum Spence after he was hit with an object from the guest stands.
Gerrard introduced eight changes to the team, which allowed Ayr to cross and move to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt went with the same eleventh Livingston who took the point of the Hearts team last week, being an amazing way in which his well-trained team tormented every step of his opponents.
Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but it's the Livingston team that did more with the ball when they got it.
They should have gotten a goal in just two minutes, when Menga's first display allowed Scott Pittman to face the Allan McGregor gate, but the helper didn't take advantage of his chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs addressed the deep shot free of charge to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow, playing in position of defender, could only remain in the back position.
The Rangers got control in the third quarter, but it looked like they had more hope than they believed in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he belonged to being punished fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless fell on himself, but Judge Steven Thomson developed the Colombian claim.
The Rangers were able to give only two customs shots in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly, was barely concerned with Lassana Coulibala's head and a weak shot of Ovie's Ejaria.
While the goal opened by Livingston in 34 minutes could be against the course of the game, no one can deny that they earned it for their own efforts.
Once again, the Rangers failed to cope with a deep permanent part of the game made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw a ball into Scott Robinson, who kept quiet, bringing it to Menga for simple action.
Gerrard was not at fault and replaced Coulibaly at Ryan Kent — the exchange almost immediately had an impact on the wingman who threw the ball into Morelos, but impressive Kelly was able to block it from his position.
The Livingston team continued to drag guests into the game exactly what they liked when Lithgow and Halkett made long applications one after another.
Holt's team may have increased the drive in the last few minutes, but McGregor was well set up before Jacobs, after Lithgow gave up his corner game.
The reserve Rangers, Glenn Middleton, once again hoped for the penalty as he slept with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes again.
Almanac: invention of Geiger counter
And now the page from our release “Sunday Morning” Almanac: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed the method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, which eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger has become both an element of science and pop culture, such as the 1950 "Bells of Coronado" film, in which you have seen the seemingly unlikely cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you'll hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: “Now something is going on! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survived until today.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” hostile cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” hostile cells and destroy them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise hostile cells in the course of treatment.
This method consists in separating the immune cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory.
Then they can “see” a protein common to many cancers. Then they are reinjected into the body.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman who was being treated with an immune system to recognise hostile cells, there was a loss of ovarian cancer for over 18 months.
The method consists in separating the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then reinjecting them to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Raka in Bethesda, Maryland said: “Our results show that this vaccine is very good.
HER2 is "involves the growth of several types of cancers", including breast cancer, ovary, lung and intestines, explained by Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the collection of immune cells from patients and to the "deciding" of their tumour cells has worked to treat a certain type of leukaemia.
Kanye West is going to the Pro-Trudge Diatryb in Saturday Night Live — with a MAGA hat on his head.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was "exploited" during the Saturday Night Live program after he praised President Donald Trumpa and said he would apply for office in 2020.
After performing his third song on that night called Ghost Town, during which he had a big hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he conducted a lead against the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trumpa.
“I speak to white people, ” he says, “How can you like Trumpa?
If I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago," he said.
The SNL program started with a sketch with Matt Damon, where a Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial committee on sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though he wasn't transmitted, West's video was sent to social media by Chris Rock's commie.
It's not known if Rock wanted to laugh at West, moving his post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had problems with his hat.
“They took after me after the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're looking at me!
And then they say I have no choice," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you think I have no way out?” he added: “I will put on “the supermen’s ash tree, so that you will not be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
We accept ourselves."
His words twice caused the public to wake up, and members of the SNL team looked embarrassed, reports Varieta. A study student at these events: “In the studio there was a tomb silence. ”
West was invited to the program instead of Ariny Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many of the performances of the track I Love it in changing the bottle of Perrier.
West has received support from Lieutenant Chief TPUS, Candace Turner, who has posted the following tweet: “To one of the bravest: Thank you for stopping with MAFII.”
The talk show Karen Hunter said on her Twitter that West simply "was himself and it's absolutely wonderful".
"However, I will NOT reward people (by buying her music or clothing or supporting her "worship"), which, I believe, accepts and disseminates an ideology to my community.
He's free.
The same way we're free," she added.
Before the program, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he had already "formally called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — he follows Diddy’s footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then the artist known earlier as Prince.

A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after stabbed a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The charges will be examined by the D.A.
The star of the Chi Kit Harington game moves the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval season of the HBO station “The Game of the Toron”.
31-year-old actor hit the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys often think that they must play hard to be respected.
In an interview on Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something went wrong" and wondered how to cope with the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the throne game plan, the 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt “righteously” moving the issue.
“Do I feel pretty comfortable at this point — where have we made a mistake about this masculinity?” he said.
“What were we teaching men when they were growing up, looking at the problem we are dealing with now? ”
Kit believes that the development of toxic masculinity may be partly responsible for TV due to the presentation of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are born and what attitudes?
What does he learn on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change it?
Clearly, things aren't all right with young men."
He also admitted in his interview that he would no longer play in any prequel or a sequel Game about the throne after the end of the series next year, saying that he had “he finished with the fields of battles and horses”.
Since November Kit will play "True West" by Sam Shepard, a story about film producers and his brother, a thief.
The actor has recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing that ever happened to him in the game of the throne.
"On schedule I met my wife, who gave me my future family and my new life," he said.
In this award-winning Emma series of fantasy Rose, Ygritte played a love-like object of character played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple took part in the Leslie family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/Aids: China has a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14-percent increase in HIV-infected citizens suffering from AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are affected, as health professionals in this country have reported.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transferred by gender, which means changing to the past.
Traditionally, HIV is spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV infected people in this way has been almost completely reduced, as the Chinese health service officials have said at the conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to one year, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a major problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination among LGBT people is widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transfer are due to insufficient protection during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided widespread access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters contradicts the fact that one of her team members reveals the senators of the Republican Party — these are “secure lies” and “conspiracy theory”.
A member of the House of Representatives of the United States, Maxine Waters, rejected the charges on Saturday, as a member of its team, that the personal data of the three Republican senators on the Wikipedia website was posted.
A member of the Democratic Party of Los Angeles assured that these accusations were filed by experts and websites related to "ultra-right wing".
"The lies, lies, and even more wicked lies," she communicated Waters with her Twitter statement.
The public information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person on the Chapter during the hearing of the panel in the Senate on the allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated person to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place some time after Kavanaugh's candidacy was questioned by three senators.
Conservative parties, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the post source was linked to Waters’ office and published information about a member of the Waters team, as Hill reported.
"This groundless charge is completely false and it is a hundred percent lie," continued Waters.
“A member of my team, whose identity, personal data and security were affected by these frauds and false charges, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This groundless charge is completely false, and it is a hundred percent lie."
Waters’ statement quickly criticized the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, the former press secretary of the White House.
"This is how denial is bad," said Fleischer.
"This suggests that it does not have the right temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
He can't provoking.
He can't question the motives of the charger.
He must remain calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism at the address of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being overly angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for mid-term elections to replace it as Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true," Tweeter wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had notified "the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these frauds".
"The judges will be exposed and held legally responsible for all their activities, which pose a threat to any member of my team," she declared.
Film Review Johnny English: Nokaut — a spy parody with a weakened RED Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in any new film with a British thread has already become the norm. It seems to apply to the new part of the series of action films and comedy "Johnny English", which began in 2003 from the film "Johnny English" and which returned to cinema screens in 2011 with film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will self-stilling satire as to how hopeless we are become a new export goods of the country?
In any case, it is always surprised by the rubber face, incompetent Johnny English again received a certificate for a party — his name and surname more than anything else signal that it is a expanded, comic product designed for non-English viewers.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent, who, despite his freakish affections for the smoothie glamour, has some of Inspector Clouseau's, a little bit of Jasia Beani and a drop from this guy adding one to the melodic theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
In the past, he was also a traveling and a worldwide man-secretist — Atkinson once played in the forgotten television commercials Barclaycard, in which he left chaos after him.
In the latest Johnny English series, there are one or two moments worthy of attention.
I liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, being dressed in medieval armor, while his helm was rhythmically struck by the pins of the rotor.
On the screen you can see clearly the gift of Atkinson for physical playing comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low flights and unnecessary, especially since now also the "important" film brands, such as 007 and Mission Imosible, offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humorist elements seem to be directed rather to children instead of adults, I think the crazy Johnny English adventures are not as creative and consistent as the gays in the nearby Atkinson films about Jasius Beans.
It's always the current assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyberhaker penetrates the British super secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field — to terrorize an agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
It's the last drop in the witch's magic premiere, which is a pumpy, wasted character already suffering from a nervous breakdown due to a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power, falling into Theresa May's character, but the scenario doesn't give her the ability to develop wings.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that, because of the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And this means an incompetent Johnny English in his own person, currently employed as a teacher in some elegant school, providing informal lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few good gays when providing spy lessons by English.
English is called to Whitehall for debriefing, reconnecting with his former bough helper, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with a submarine commander — a happy but somewhat tired figure played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin of partying in the secret service of Her Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatala Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
However, the Prime Minister is dangerously ruled by the charismatic billionaire-tech manic, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of the UK — the villain Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their crucificate of absurd situations: the waiters are set on a French restaurant; they enter chaos, sneaking onto the luxury yacht of Volta; and English is getting desolation while using the set to virtual reality to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
In this last sequence, all limitations disappear, but despite a nice and human performance, the whole film looks very much like television for children.
Typical diameter.
Like other Johnny English films, I couldn't resist thinking: can the British film industry give Rownaw Atkinson the role that really fit his talent?
The working party refuses to draw up a plan that provides for the British four-day working week for which they will be paid in five days.
The working party of Jeremy Corbyn will consider the introduction of a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week, receiving a salary for five days.
The party says it wants business leaders to hand over savings to employees through a revolution related to the development of artificial intelligence (AI), giving them an additional free day.
This would enable employees to enjoy the three-day weekend, obtaining the same amount of remuneration.
Sources say that this idea will be "inscribed" in the economic programme of the parties and plans to leave the country against employees.
The four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way of using employees to change the economy.
An older member of the Labour Party in a talk from The Sunday Times said: “It is expected that before the end of this year there will be a policy change announcement.”
“It will not happen from day to day, but a four-day working week is something that takes part in the party’s approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party committed itself to introducing a four-day election campaign in 2017.
However, these plans are currently not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
Labour Ombudsman said: “The four-day working week is not party politics and its introduction is not considered by it.”
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadow Office, used last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision for the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from "drives without faces" and "spekults" in public utility companies.
The plans from the Shadow Office also mean that present shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire share because the Labour Party Government could make a "calculation" based on the identified abuse.
It also confirmed the plans for employees to be included in company boards and the creation of integrated equity funds in order to provide 10 percent of their own capital to private-sector employees who receive an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the question of whether the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh can make them change their attitudes.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised questions about whether the findings of the investigating office could lead the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview conducted on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that might lead to a change in their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his friend in South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh at the hearing.
I called him after it happened when he came to this charge, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, and unambiguous."
However, Graham's opinion appears to be stoned.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh and to change her needs a strong charge," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, calling on Christine Blasey Ford.
‘No person has been able to verify this.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything's gonna change."
What is the event of Global Citizens Festival and has, to any extent, contributed to reducing the level of poverty?
The Global Citizens Festival will be held next Saturday in New York, and an annual musical event can be honored with an extremely impressive composition of the stars and an equally impressive mission — the elimination of poverty in the world.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving at Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the most important objective of this event, which is the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is the extension of Global Poverty Project, an international group of activists to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for this event (unless decided to buy a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world leader, performing telephones or other significant actions to raise awareness about the objective of poverty eradication.
But what success can Global Citizens praise in the 12 years left to achieve?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to require action, or another case so-called “cliktivism” when people feel that they do something important by signing a petition online or by placing an entry on the Tweeter?
The Global Citizens organization claims that since 2011 it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" for those supporting the action in order to achieve a wide range of objectives.
It also claims that these actions helped the world leaders to offer commitments and provisions worth over 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, in which at least 10 billion dollars had already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that the safeguards so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, the British Partnership of Investors and Real Estates involved in helping children to achieve their full potential, which promised to transfer Rwanda 35 million dollars to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after Global Citizens sent over 4700 tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, such as you, we can make social injustices as malnutrition is going into history" — Tracey Ulllman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, following over 5,000 actions calling on the Great Britain to improve the quality of mother feeding and children, the government announced financing the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition problems.
One of the most frequently asked questions on his website, which was, "How sure can extreme poverty be eliminated?"
The Global Citizen replied: “This will be a long and difficult way — sometimes we will struggle and fail.
But as with the recent great movements for civil rights and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Week, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars present during this year's event in New York, which will host Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to "block" Russian energy export — Secretary of the Interior
Washington may “if necessary” flee to his Navy to prevent Russian energy from coming into markets, including those in the Middle East, have revealed to the US Internal Affairs Secretary Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner.
Zinke insisted that Russia’s engagement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of the rule of law — is a pretext for the exploration of new energy markets.
"I consider that the reason why they are in the Middle East is the desire to broker in energy trade, as it is in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States has the opportunity to make sure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which itself defines itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, stating that they are actually the same.
"The economic report of Iran and Russia is about to use and replace fuels," he said, comparing Russia to a "manufacturer of one trick" with a fossil fuel economy.
These statements appeared at a time when Trumpa’s administration continues its mission, which aims to increase the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, which is much cheaper for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, officials of Trumpa administration, including the same president of the United States, Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the implementation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trumpa made Berlin the "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars to double the existing capacity of up to 110 billion cubic metres is an economic project only.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is solely due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I consider that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Mr.Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The U.S. position triggered a violent response from Germany, which confirmed their commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I note that this is a big problem when the third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting by Chancellor Angela Merkel with President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said she would consider running for president in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after the mid-term elections, she would consider running for president.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering his candidacy.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to repair the corrupt government, and it is also the case for women with the highest rank", said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider my candidacy as president."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned the Donald Trumpie Presidency, saying that she would “lead the country in the wrong direction”.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren expressed her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday on Twitter Warren wrote: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s voters did not think that they should be candidate in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the Massachusetts voters choosing the option of "probably" said that the senator should not run as a result of the survey carried out by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The probe showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidates — 38 percent of people supported his potential candidate, and 48 percent of people were against her.
Other known names from the democratic camp taken into account in respect of a potential candidate in 2020 were former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make his official decision by January, as she gave the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) Track Palin during Donald Trump's election tower
Trak Palin (26 years) spent a year in Iraq after reaching out to the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, which he must go on his way back, I understand other families that have the effect of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are getting back," said the audiences on the election tower of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called arresting her son “the topic of taboo”, after which she said about her son and other military vets: “returning a little change, coming back, coming back, wondering if they would be shown respect for what their fellow soldiers, the pilots and all the other military members gave to their own country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence in a woman, by calling for false statements in a report on domestic violence, and possession of weapons in an sober state, as Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilli Police Department.
18 States and Colombia's District support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Colombia District support the legal challenge of a new US policy that refuses to give asylum to victims fleeing from gang or domestic violence.
On Friday, Washington, 18 states and districts have issued a list of amicus curiots to support asylum seekers dealing with this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the reason for Grace v. Sessions, which American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang sons were harassed by her, but the US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She's been detained in Texas.
The prosecutors of the U.S. state supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there is a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S. as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The New American Asylum Policy repealed the Board of Immigration Services decision of 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of Colombia, said on Friday's statement that the new policy "will ignore existing state, federal and international law for decades".
"The federal law requires that all applications for asylum be examined on the basis of facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle", as written in the list of amicus curić.
The prosecutors continued to argue in the letter that the policy refusing entry harmed the US economy by claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and "set the necessary labour force".
In June, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing from domestic violence and those caused by gangs.
"Azil is available for those who leave their country of origin for persecution or fear against racial, religious, national, or because they belong to a specific social group or who have such other political convictions" said the Assembly in his statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
Azil never meant to solve all the problems — even those serious — with which people from all over the world are facing each day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Pala in situations where the number of deaths doubled in a race that aims to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become more and more tragic.
"It's a very intense feeling," said Risa Kusum's 35-year-old mother, comforting her angry son in an evacuation center in Pala city.
“Every minute an ambulance will bring the body.
There's no clean water."
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes searching through the water of things and trying to save everything they could find.
A hundred people were injured in the morning, and hospitals, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees, were rapidly overflowing.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractured spine and shoulder, rested outside of the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors due to severe secondary shocks.
The tears filled his eyes with a violent earthquake that shrugged with a room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was stuck in a rumbage wall" – Haris said the Associated Press, adding that his family came to town for the wedding.
“ I heard my wife call for help, and her voice was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The ambassador of the United States is accusing China of “advertising” propaganda advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page commercial advertisement in the American daily, approving the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to a paid addition to China Daily in Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of attempting to interfere with the US Congress on 6 November — China contradicts this charge.
The claim that Beijing tried to interfere with the elections in the United States confirmed what American officials told Reuters that it was a new stage in escalating the campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to include advertising promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently escalating trade wars that have led to an increase in tariffs for imports.
Chinese trade retaliation tariffs were intended to touch exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republic of Trumpa, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, United States ambassador in China and former long-term Governor of Iowa — the main exporter of agricultural products to China — said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad said in his article in the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register that China “are now beginning to double the force of harassment by placing propaganda advertising in our own free press.”
“With its propaganda, China’s government uses a respected American tradition of freedom of expression and free press, placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register”, wrote Branstad.
For this, in the kiosk street in Beijing, there will be no objection and no real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese might have on the worrying economic direction that China has, given that the media are under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans express themselves to the mid-term elections of women with the right to vote in Kavanaugh, warn analysts
While many leading Republicans support and defend themselves nominated to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, the analyst warns you that they will meet during the upcoming mid-term elections with a violent reaction, especially on the part of women.
The forces accompanying this event are very large, and most Republicans are already officially willing to vote.
“This one cannot undo” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the University of Syracuse, published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he had doubts about whether he was trying Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) to conduct an investigation at the last moment by the FBI, enough to calm the angry voters.
“The women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it until November”, said Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and spokesperson of the national progressive group MoveOn, as the newspaper published in Washington.
On Friday morning, protesters plotted the slogan “Welcome November”, demonstrating in the Senate Hall because of the decision by the Republicans to control the Court of First Instance not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony — as Mic gave.
“The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond” said one of Stu Rothenberg's information sites, an impartial political analyst.
“ People say he was tall already, and it is true.
But it may be higher, especially among undecided women from the predominant and younger voters aged 18 to 29 who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote".
Even before the Ford's public statement, in which it described its allegations of sexual assault against the candidate's address to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if the Republicans opted for approval of the candidate, it could meet a violent reaction.
“The Republican Party needs to deal with a small mess,” Michael Steele said at the beginning of last week, former Republican National Committee president, according to NBC News.
"This is not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it is also about how the Republicans have handled this situation and how they treated the Ford", said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities of the USA, a group that helps the Democratic elections.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe in Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with a little greater support for the latter.
YouGov's new poll shows that 41 percent of the respondents strongly or rather believed Ford's testimony, whereas 35 percent claimed that it was definitely or rather believed by Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents claimed that Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying at the time of making statements, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBI started an investigation into Ford charges, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford took a statement last week under oath before the Senate Court of Justice that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nomination for the Supreme Court showed her his genitalia at the time of his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, creator of World Wide Web, runs a startup that is designed to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform — Solid — which belongs to Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and what persons have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Berners-Lee, Inrupt is “domination over the world”.
"We must do it now," he said, referring to the startup.
"The last historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "on-line store with personal data" or otherwise Thank you.
It may include lists of contacts, lists of things to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the online store with personal data is that totally depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this "personal submission through data".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all people.
Currently, Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several project developers and a community of developers.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, which will result in a shift up from day to day with all their business models.
"I'm not asking them for permission."
In its publication on the Medium Post platform Berners-Lee, “Inrupt is providing commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based network.”
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has done a lot in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Calling for life Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very excited to think about the next era in network development," he added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Appointment of the Spiritual Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only spiritual Church of England, which during World War I was appointed by the Cross of Victoria, was celebrated 100 years later in his home town.
Płk Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded September 29, 1918 for the assault on the Bellengly and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing he was appointed by the British military order.
On Saturday his two grandkids sent a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandkids, Michael Vann, said that the discovery of a stone exactly in the hundredth anniversary of my grandfather's designation was “a uniquely symbolic character.”
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin channel “in a very dense fog and under strong fire from field and machine guns".
He then speeded up to the line of fire and with the “most courage” he led it forward, and he put the attack on the position of the field alone, depriving three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72 years) said that his grandfather’s actions were “somehow I would never be able to meet, but at the same time something humble.”
Along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he gave birth after the end of the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “very honored to participate in the parade” and added that “the courage of the true hero is shown in the support he receives from many people.”
The MMA fans didn't burn all night to watch the Bellator 206, instead they got the Peppa Pig.
Imagine you haven't slept all night to see the emotions of the Bellator 206, and eventually you can't see the main fight.
The San Jose gali program contained 13 fights, including six on the main tab, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5 channel.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the viewers in the UK were shocked to change the program for the Puppa Festival.
Some were disappointed when they did not sleep until the early morning hours especially to see the fight.
One of the Twitter fans described the conversion of children's cartoons as "a sick joke."
“In accordance with the Government Regulation, the content of this type is inappropriate to leave it at 6 a.m., making it necessary to change to the programme for children”, said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communication of Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa Swine, yes."
The CEO of Bellator, Scott Cook, said they'd work out a schedule to take the viewers from the UK into account in the future.
"When I think about the recurrence, I think we can fix it," Coker said.
“But it is Sunday six o’clock in the morning, so that we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday by their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, we had a lot of comments that none of them sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't a mistake, it was just a legal matter.
I can promise you, this will never happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six — that is, to the standard amount. We were too keen to please the fans and unfortunately, we took over.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “hoter” because of sexuality
Tom Daley, the Olympic jumper in the water, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old said he didn't realize that not all of them were like him until he went to high school.
In Desert Island Discs Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others a "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The custom run by this program issued for many years, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
In the first time in the programme led by Laverne, Daley said that growing up, he felt “at least valuable” from others, because “the one-day love of boys and girls was not socially acceptable.”
He said: “Today this sense of less value and being to others is something that gives me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that he was worth something, not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time brown Olympic medalist has become the vocal activists of the LGBT community and has used his performance at this year's United Nations Games in Australia to call for more countries to de-criminate homosexuality.
He said that he decided to express himself because he felt happy, able to live openly, without any implications, and in this way he wanted to give others “hope.”
Three times the world’s champion said that falling in love with a man — the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “he was surprised. ”
Daley got married to an Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, indicating that the age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you go through so much in such a young age,” he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father’s death due to cancer three years later, “he said that it was difficult for him to find someone at the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple stayed in June with the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
"The most important thing for me last year was to get a gold medal," he said.
“And you know what? There are more important things than gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 after he diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 — he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him: "You won't be with us to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held him by his hand when he stopped breathing. Only when he stopped breathing and died, I understood that he was not invincible," he said.
In the following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I knew this was what I dreamed of all my life — jumping into the water before the crowd of people in the Olympic Games — it was the best feeling I could do,” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song, the Proud performed by Heather Small, who accompanied him during preparations for the Olympic Games and who still seasoned him with goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is released at BBC Radio 4 on every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Show no form of Mickelson on the bench during the Saturday night Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when it plays his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but she will have to work on her form so she won't cut off her heel.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in the event every two years, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's football and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it often happened in his case on the United States team, five times the winner had to spend the day ping the team and work on improving his game in the hope of repairing his message to the bench.
The 48-year-old who never hit the simplest, even at the top moment of his career, does not really work well on the tight field of Le Golf National, where misdemeanors are punishable by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not discouraging enough for Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, it must face the precision of the British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with the debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the beginning of the 12 singles) start the game with a vertebrae, the Mickelson game may be extremely key.
Fury expressed confidence in his player — he could not do anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, knocked me on my back, took my hand and said that he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He is in the gallery famous and has brought many to play his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there would be more, but that's what we had to do.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This may mean the end of his career at Ryder Cup, which never compared his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories on his account, 20 defeats, and seven remissions. Furyk said that his presence brought a lot to the band.
"It's funny, sarcastic, witty, eloquent, and it's good to have it in the team's room," he explained.
“I think young players had fun playing with him this week, which was nice to see.
It's a person who's more than just a game."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a high point advantage can soon shrink.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before the launch of the single on the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in the Valderram field game, where, along with the accompanying Captain Sev Ballesteros, had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the meth line was left with the shortest hair possible, winning 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"We could not forget that we had a great advantage in the Valderram field; we also had a great advantage in the Brookline field where we lost and in the Valderra field we only won the hair" said Bjorn, on the photo, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 both Friday and yesterday, which led to 10-6 in the Le Golf National field.
Time will show me and all the band members that this is not over.
You're giving everything to yourself tomorrow.
Get out there and do whatever you need to do.
The end will only be when points appear on the board.
We have the objective of getting a trophy, and we need to focus on it.
From the beginning, I said that I am focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who people are on the opposite side — the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with how his professionals managed in a difficult field, added: “I wouldn’t do better.
But tomorrow is different.
The singles begin tomorrow, and that's another question.
It's good to play with your partner when everything goes the way, but when you play single, your golf skills are tested to limit opportunities.
It's a message that you have to pass to the players, so tomorrow we'll give it all to you.
The partner also has to give it all to himself."
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to achieve better results alone than when playing with their partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three points from four.
Sam Furyk experienced a lot of returns on the last day, being a member of the winner's team on Brookline, and then failed after the European team made "Minnah class".
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, warmed up to fight his players on the last day.
“We play 12 important games tomorrow — you'd like to start playing fast, as happened on Brookline and Medinah fields.
If this drive goes one way, it'll put a lot of pressure on middle matches.
We set up our composition and set up the boys in a way that would allow us to fail tomorrow."
Thomas was entrusted with the task of leading a counter-tact, facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other European team players in the top half of the programme.
"I've decided on this group of guys in this order because I think he's gonna be able to do it all the time," Bjorn said about his singles election.
New German warships delayed again
The latest German Navy frigate should be put into use in 2014 to replace the ageing warships from the Cold War but this will not happen at least until next year due to faulty agreements and rising at an alarming rate of costs, as local media have reported.
The reference to the use of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new class of Baden-Wuerttemberg, was moved to the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit gave a paper, referring to the military spokesperson.
The ship should be included in the Navy in 2014, but, as a result of the problems that occurred after delivery, it was necessary to amend this ambitious project.
Four units of Baden-Wuertemberg, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the ageing frregates of the Bremen class.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-route missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, including reduction of radar tracks, infrared and acoustic.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — the operation of new ferrets should be possible for up to two years away from parent ports.
However, continued delays mean that these modern warships, which will enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete at the time of the start of the ministry — are recorded by Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate of F125 appeared on the first pages of the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the yard after the shipment.
Not much was known about the causes behind the return, but the German media informed about a number of key "software and equipment insects" that made the ship useless in the battle mission.
The software flaws were particularly important, since Baden-Wuertemberg ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half less than for the older Bremen class ferrets.
It has also turned out that the ship is far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the possibility of carrying out a warship for future modernization.
It is believed that a weighing 7000 tonnes of the Rheinland-Pfalz ship is twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the problem also becomes the cost of the whole project — including crew training.
It is said to have reached a stunning level of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), while the initial cost was €2.2 billion.
The problems of dedication to the use of new ferrets are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings concerning the fact that the strength of the German maritime fleet is shrinking.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the sailors “will end with ships capable of using”.
He also said that over time, this problem increased as a result of the withdrawal from the operation of old vessels without providing replacement vessels.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction of the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg classes could have been included in the Navy fleet.
National Trust will listen to the secret life of bats
New property research in the Scottish Highlands area has the aim of showing how bats use the landscape when obtaining food.
Research results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these special flying mammals and will help guide future actions to protect them.
The research carried out by scientists from National Trust for Scotland will concern common and small dwarfs, as well as brown bats with long ears and bats from the family of red nights in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the estate to track the activity of bats all year round.
NHS employees and volunteers will also carry out field tests using portable detectors.
The sound analysis of all recordings is designed to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and how the individual species behave.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed image of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor in NTS, hopes to reveal the results of which habitat areas are essential to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are at risk of construction and development work, which have an impact on earths and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may also pose a threat, as well as fly polishes and certain chemical products used in construction materials and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of the nightary customs of their ears, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a complex technique of echolocation to search for worms and obstacles on their way.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land all over the country, treats bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out tests, check the grates, and sometimes even rescue activities.
The organization even founded the first and only in Scotland dedicated to the reserve of bats in the Threve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten Scottish species of bats.
David Thompson, property manager, says it's a perfect territory for bats.
"Threave has a wonderful area for bats," he said.
“ We have old buildings, plenty of old trees, and excellent habitats.
However, there are still many unknowing about bats. The work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of checks in terms of bats' existence before they begin to conduct maintenance work in estates, as inadvertent destruction of one grate can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are under protection — their killing, harassing, or disturbing, and destroying their heads is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged public opinion to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species we do not even know how to cope with their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while his lawyers intend to sue a German warehouse
Cristiano Ronaldo identified the allegations against him of rape as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote", using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German information magazine Der Spiegel, who published these allegations.
The Portuguese attacker Juventus was accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the Friday news, Der Spiegel was going to pay a woman $750,000 to keep quiet.
Ronaldo (33 years), a few hours after the announcement of charges, in an instagram live message addressed to his 142 million folklore, identified these reports as ‘fake news’.
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's news is a face news," said the five-time gold ball winner.
"They want to promote using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's fine," he added a footballer with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel’s warehouse in connection with the allegations that they called “an unacceptable suspicion in the area of privacy”, as Reuters states.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer will claim compensation for “moral damages in the amount corresponding to the weight of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years.”
The event took place in June 2009 in Palms Hotel and Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
Following a meeting at the Ronaldo and Mayorg night club, they reportedly went to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped a woman anal — as a result of the documents in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorca claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that at "99 percent he was a good guy," who was visited by this "one percent".
According to Ronaldo's records, the couple confirmed that she had sex, but this was done by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken in the hospital, but later agreed to an extra-judge settlement because she was "repite" and "public humiliation".
34-year-old says he wants to invalidate the settlement now, because he still can't forget the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged assault, Ronaldo crossed from Manchester United to Realu Madrid, and this summer moved to Juventus after paying for him EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom would regret leaving car manufacturers after all time
After leaving the European Union, the United Kingdom would "sorry this after all", if after leaving the European Union the world leader in car production had lost its status, said Greg Clark's Minister of Business.
He added that "she was concerned" when a representative of Toyota UK told the BBC in an interview that if the United Kingdom left the EU without agreement, production in Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily suspended.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of late late on the border in the absence of an agreement on Brexit may lead to a reduction of jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, in which Auris and Avensis models are manufactured, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think that if the United Kingdom comes out at the end of March with no agreement from the European Union, then there will be a halt of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers are afraid to leave the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, the BMW intends to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern are, as car manufacturers claim, the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of leaving the European Union without agreement by Great Britain.
Toyota's production line operates on an "just-in-time" basis, where parts reach 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for custom-made cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be difficulties at the border, which, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
As the company's representative said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without supplies to his factory in Derbyshire, making the production stop.
Clark said that the plan with Chequers Theresa May on future relations with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid border controls”.
"We need an agreement, we want to achieve the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy the present success, but will also allow us to take advantage of this situation," said today's BBC Radio 4 programme.
“The statements not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, show that we must be able to continue what was consisting of a very efficient set of supply chains.”
The Toyota representation was unable to state how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the longer term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, which would lead to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and has been a member of the Union’s trade union organization’s corporate council, said that the union members are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are to be destroyed, they will never be restored again.
The Government Ombudsman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union."
The meeting of Trump with Rosenstein may again be delayed, as the White House says.
The important meeting of Donald Trumpa with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "related for another week" due to the ongoing fight for a candidate to court of the highest Brett Kavanaugh, as he delivered on Sunday the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the possibility of interfering with the Russians in elections, the link between the close associates of Trump and Russia, and the potential distortion of the action of justice by the President.
Whether Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General, threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months now.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times report that Rosenstein spoke about wearing wires to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from his position on the basis of 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports, as if he were to be put into smoke.
The meeting with Trump, who was then at UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein. There was a meeting transferred to avoid collation with the hearing of the Senate Court of Justice, during which the statements were made by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation by the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
The press director, Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The time limit for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, and it may be moved for another week, taking into account all the events associated with the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'll definitely inform the press."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders had not held a press conference for the White House since 10 September.
The running program, Chris Wallace, asked about the cause.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences was not caused by the "sentenced" television journalists, and she added: "I will not hide that they are "ostentiary".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The present President is conducting more "questions and Answers" sessions than any other president in front of him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We have met the numbers."
The press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States questions, this is much better than talking to me.
We try to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we have done it very often. Press conferences will stand aside for sessions where you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with burning dignitaries.
The only press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why it is, acting too freely and surprisingly before the gathered journalists.
Health Minister writes to workers from European Union countries employed in NHS Scotland in the face of Brexit-related concerns
The Minister of Health made a letter to workers from European Union countries employed in the Scottish health service to convey their appreciation to them from the country and to ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter for less than six months until the United Kingdom of the European Union left.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of examining applications for “settled status” for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “At the end of the negotiations on the departure of the United Kingdom of the European Union, the right decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat again how much I value the contribution of every member of staff, irrespective of his nationality.
Friends from all over the EU and outside it bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve health and bring benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing surgery as a result of a trauma to the head.
The charming Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, performed an operation as a result of a head injury in a Saturday match with Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended with a failure of the Tennessee team with the result of 31-27, informed Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told the journalists that he had suffered injury shortly before the end of the first half.
“He came to the side line, after which he went down to the ground,” said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line, then placed it on their feet and carried it out to carry out further tests.
The representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, that Abercrombie was operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he had no details yet regarding the type/mature of trauma, and Tennessee State was trying to determine when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie (a second year student fired from representing universities for the year to train his skills) plays his first season in Tennessee State after transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, before the game ended, he had five locusts, which gave him 18 grays all season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax charge when purchasing real estate in the UK
In line with the new plans of buyers from abroad, higher tax fees will be charged for the purchase of real estate in the UK. The funds thus obtained will be allocated to help homeless people.
This move is supposed to bring down Jeremy Corby's success to attract a young electorate.
The increase in tax charges will cover persons who do not tax in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Treasury foresees that it will receive up to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May will inform today that foreigners who purchase real estate in the UK will be charged a higher tax charge, thus obtaining additional funds for help to the homeless.
This move is taken as an attempt to eliminate Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young elites with promises of cheaper housing and increase the burden of more earners.
Higher tax fees will apply to individuals and non-tax companies in the UK. Additional measures are intended to help the government fight homelessness.
An additional fee — charged in addition to the current tax fee, including the two years brought in by higher rates for second homes and rental homes — can be even three percent.
The Treasury expects that this move will allow for up to £ 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and hampers the purchase of the first house or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy real estate and spend most of their time outside the country, many wealthy regions — and especially the capital — have turned into “a city of spirits. ”
The new rules only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call for a tax reduction to help young people buy their first house.
He accused large developers of maintaining high house prices by occupying the site, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to remove the limits of low-cost apartments to eliminate the "house scandal" in the United Kingdom.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including the regulation of rents and the end of the “no reason” exmission.
He also wants to give local authorities greater powers to build new houses.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that as Prime Minister, I will commit myself to rebuilding the British dream of making every subsequent generation better than the previous generation.
This also means repairing our abandoned housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign firms, can easily buy real estate here which are hard-working British residents.
For too many people the dream of their own home became very distant, for this humiliation related to the need for nighting on the street remains beyond real".
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to become a Scottish senior."
Coach Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "most ambition" is to be a student of Scotland at some point.
This 40-year-old Scots with commitment is working on healing the North-East Club, which currently takes third place in League One with a three-point loss compared to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after the last season St Mirren entered the Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player,
But I only managed to get to staff B," said Ross in an interview for BBC Scotland's Sportsund.
“ As a child, I often watched a football game with my father in Hampton, and I was always attracted to it.
However, such an opportunity will come only if I am successful as a coach of the club".
Among Ross' predecessors at Sunderland, Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio were found.
Former coach Alloa Athletic claims that he does not feel pampered by taking up the role of such outstanding personalities in such a large club, rejecting the proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town earlier.
“The success will currently be measured to me if I can bring this club back to Premier League.
Given his structure and the comfort that he has, he certainly adds.
“It will not be easy to do this, but I will probably feel that I have been successful here, only if I succeed.”
Ross's coaching career lasts for only three years, and before that, he was a coach's assistant at Dumbarton, and for 15 months he was part of the Hearts team' coaching team.
He then helped Alloa once again to upgrade to the third league, and in the next season he led the team St Mirren from the edge to the title of the champion.
Jack Ross says he's feeling a lot more comfortable now than when he played Clyde, Hartpecol, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real turning point,” notes Coach Allo's position.
“I really believed that running a team is a lot better for me than playing myself.
It will sound strange, because as a player, I have worked well and achieved some tangible successes.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
You need to break through situations every week.
They still meet me when it comes to stress and pressure related to coach's work, but I feel good about that role.
I've always wanted to train others, and now I'm doing this, and I can say that right now I feel the most in my entire adult life."
The entire interview at Sportsund can be listened on Sunday, September 30 on the Scotland Radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
Research shows that the best beer pore is 5:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave caused a rapid flow of customers to British pubs, but it hit a hive in the restaurants' networks.
The research showed that sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants it fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, who developed the data, says: “The round heat and longer than anticipated the participation of England in the World Championships made the results of July similar to June, when the pub giants increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the earnings of restaurants fell even more.
The 1.8% decrease in sales in restaurants in July increased even further.
The offers of pubs and bars were best served – their growth in sales exceeded the decline recorded in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during heat, although not as much as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just thirsty.
The sale of drinks in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month and the food fell by three percent".
Paul Newman of the RSM for analysis of the entertainment and tourism industry says: “These results have been recorded in the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the volume of consumption 'outside the house' remain the weather and large sporting events or social activities.
The fact that restaurant networks are experiencing difficult moments is not surprising, although the decrease in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will have particularly severe consequences when taking into account constant pressures on cost reduction.
The long and hot summer came at the most beneficial time for owners of food-supplying facilities and time will show whether or not the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring such a need for ecclesiasment."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly opened ones, amounted to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting slowdown in the development of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which is a monitoring of the sale in the pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Studies have shown that one in five children — some of them aged only 11 — have secret social networks that hide from parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the number of pages "face Insta"
These messages raised concerns that sexual content was published on them.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account that shows their parents
One in five children — some at the age of only 11 — stores social networks that are not disclosed to adults.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid rise in the “face Insta” accounts — a name refers to a Instagram service in which you can share images.
These messages raised concerns that these accounts serve to publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of students admitted to running a grubby "main" account that shows parents, and besides, they also have private accounts.
One of the mothers who accidentally came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, encountered a teenager who told others to "suicide".
A study conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmistress" Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of pupils aged between 11 and 18 have two profiles. Half of them are granted to maintain private accounts.
The CEO of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: “It is worrying that so many teenagers create their places on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will become the “voice of athletes” on the board of Scottish Athletics
During the annual general meeting of Scottish Athletics Eildh Doyle, she was elected to the board as a non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most gifted Scottish athlete. The President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who manage sport to benefit from her extensive international experience gained in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect for the Scottish community, UK and the world’s athletes, and we are sure that the introduction to the board will bring Scottish athletes great benefits” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very glad that I will have the opportunity to convey the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really help in managing sport in Scotland.”
The American, which among its four gold Olympic medals has a victory in the 200-400-meter race at the Atlantic Olympics in 1996, and now regularly perform in the BBC as an expert, cannot be seen as a result of a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke last month.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that time will show me whether or not I will regain efficiency and to what extent.
It was a quaint work, but I fully recovered, and I learned to walk again and I went back to training!
Thank you for all the words of support!"
Lactators' advertising, which compares their mothers to cows, excesses extreme emotions on the Internet
A company producing lactose caused a storm on the Internet, publishing a commercial that compares mothers breast-feeding to milked cows.
In order to announce the launch of the "first silent paint maker in the world to wear under clothing", its producer, Elvie, published a retractive advertising in the form of a video that highlights the freedom it provides to mothers.
It presents four real mothers dancing in a filled hay to a song where they hear the words: "Yes, I get it, but you don't see the tail," and "as you don't notice, it's not just my boobs mentioned."
In turn, Refren goes: “Excuse them, pump them out, feed them children, pump them out, pump them out, I will deliver your ladies.”
A commercial that was published on a Facebook page of the company caused large controversy on the Internet.
The film now has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many say that it is not appropriate to joke with the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“ The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they must become pregnant and give birth to a calf, with their children being taken away from them after a few days of birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie/Mother Lactator can be used for non-recognition under feeding bras (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “It is, of course, traumatic both for the mother and for the child.
Of course, let's use cows to advertise lactatings for mothers who can keep their children."
Someone else added: "This ad is totally out of reality."
Another weapon of the video — one of the women said that the song was "funny".
“I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one of those for myself.
I felt like a cow when I pulled out of the food.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I'm not looking for a second bottom.
It's a brilliant invention," someone wrote.
One other commented: “It’s a funny advertisement addressed to mothers who take away food (commonly at work or toilet) and feel like a ‘ cow’.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry."
At the end of the movie, it turns out that women danced with varnishers who were discreetly stuck in their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the idea that many feeding women felt like cows.
However, the Elvie Lactator is completely quiet, there are no cables or tubes and you can wear it unnoticed under your breasts for feeding, which gives women the freedom to move, to keep children on their hands, and even to leave the house while eating.
Ana Balarin, a creative partner and director at Mother, said: “Lactator Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a courageous and provocative prime minister.
By putting together feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges that it poses in the fun and coherent way of an incredible sense of freedom that it provides.
It's not the first time that Elvie's lactose hit the front of the newspaper.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the run during the Marty Jakubowski show with the same product attached.
Hundreds of immigrants were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by immigrants is rapidly increasing, although the number of persons crossing the border does not change properly every month. This is due in part to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and principles introduced by President Trumpa's administration have made it difficult to place children in sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually undocumented immigrants who are afraid of exposure to deportation if they report after their child.
Such risks increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult living in a joint holding would be charged fingerprints, which would then be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, an older official at the agency Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had already reported themselves as sponsors for children left without care.
The Agency confirmed later that 70 percent of the arrested had not been previously listed.
“No less than 80 percent of those who are sponsors or live with them in one household are illegally staying in the country, and much of them are foreign nationals with criminal history.
That's why we keep chasing them," Albence said.
The shelter workers say that, as a result of efforts to accelerate the regulation of children, officials have put in place new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of detention — not 60 days after the previous standards.
A lot will be held through a video conference, not personally, to ask the immigration judge to legalise their status.
Those that do not qualify for release will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer the children are in custody, the easier they can become restless or fall into depression, which in turn can lead to an outbreak of aggression or attempts to escape.
The defenses found that these problems are even more serious for larger centres such as Tornillo, where because of its size it is easier to overlook signals that something bad happens with the baby.
They also added that the transfer of children to a tent camp without giving them the right time to make emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends may exacerbate a trauma with which many of them already struggle.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "receiving forces" to immediately withdraw
During the speech before the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Mual, also called on the refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in this country has been going on for eight years.
Moual, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces live illegally in Syrian lands under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "we deal with them appropriately".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally” said the Assembly.
Moualem claims that "the war of terrorism almost ended" in Syria, where more than 30,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to "lead its sacred battle to the cleansing of Syria" both from terrorist groups and from "universal foreign nationals residing on it illegally".
Today, around 2000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in Syria, who mainly train the Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar Al-Asad and advise them.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the land destroyed by the war.
As regards refugees, Moual said that the conditions are good enough for them to return, and accused “some western countries” of “building an unreasonable fear” that discourages them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations for help in these returns," he said.
"They are policy cases that should have a purely human dimension."
The United States and the European Union have warned that, until President Assad has concluded with opposition to the political agreement for the end of the war, Syria will receive no support for reconstruction.
The United Nations Diplomacy states that the last agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major bastion of rebels in Idlib has created the possibility of continuing political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a large attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province of three million people.
However, Moual stressed that the agreement had a “except time frame” and expressed his hope that the military action would be measured in jihadists, including those associated with the Al-Qaeda Front of the Levant People's Defense, who would be “exempted”.
The UN Envoy Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the ruling party and opposition to develop a draft of the post-war constitution of Syria and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to verifying the records of the current Constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins the election again
According to this logic, President Trump would have been elected for the second term in 2020, unless, as most likely, many liberal observers hope, his presidency would have ended with removal from office and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be the “most dramatic finale ever” of the presidency.
So far, there are no signs of fatigue of viewers.
Since 2014, the CNN channel ratings in primie had doubled and reached 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC channel almost tripled, to 1.6 million viewers.
According to the agency, Nielsen Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in the top time, which is an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago, and the MSNBC “The Rachel Maddow Show” program has achieved the highest results among cable TVs, attracting up to 3.5 million viewers of evening information programs.
“People fly like moths to the fire — this is something we do not understand” — said Neal Bear, the lead producer of the ABC series “Designed Survival” about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, experienced creative comedy and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sleeping Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has a different theory.
She mentioned how she was driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“Because he makes me laugh,” he answered.
"Chaos has a entertainment value."
Of course, reports from Washington could be like nothing else shown on TV to oversee the future of the Roe v. Wade case, about the admissibility of the merger of migrant families or the state of the world economy.
Turn off is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it's not just about being well informed citizens, when you're looking at the sixth hour panel of experts discussing using Bob Woodward's secret informants when writing Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 "a child loaded with pride," as The Washington Post said, or about the implications of the shocking descriptions of President Trumpa's anatomy revealed by Storm Daniels.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again like I used to.
“What he does, after part, reminds the reality of the show in this respect that every evening comes in new content” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars”, about changing location and everyday returns of action show Trumpa (such as an attack on NFL league players or the praise of Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna have a backdrop.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north coast of the island of Kauai, where she had her home, she was beautiful, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from it, not when Brett Kavanaugh had just stood before the Senate Association Commission and weighed the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember how we had done all these crazy programs before and people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were kidding, but it turns out they were right."

Overflow of money from outside for election campaign to Congress
Not surprisingly, the fact that, after reorganising constituency districts, two current congressmen will now stand in the race for one job, a cash river flows to the 17th constituency district in Pennsylvania.
This recently created suburban district of Pittsburgh represents the representative of Democrats in Congress, Conor Lamb, who obtained his seat in another district during a special election last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus currently representing the district of 12th in Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new district 17.
The maps of the districts were corrected after the January judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled that the old districts had been determined unfairly, which gave rise to an advantage to the Republicans and was incompatible with the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district began with the fight to finance the campaign between the main party funding bodies — the Democratic Campaig Congresse (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning the Italian win in widely commented elections to the 18th electoral district, which took place in March.
For more than a decade now, he has been a Republican, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this district.
Political experts gave Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States was considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but they withdrew from this idea.
Diplomacy noticed that Dominican and Panama had already declared Beijing, despite a slight objection to Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a hearty meeting with President Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until the management team's partner, Trump Organization had a hotel in Panama.
The State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican and Panama because of the "oldest decisions to stop Taiwan's recognition," as she said in her statement this month, the Department's spokesperson Heather Nauert.
However, the sanctions considered were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which, according to estimates in 2017, received assistance from the United States of 140 million to combat drugs and to support development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions to limit financial assistance and grant visas to certain persons would be very sensitive to this Central American country, which is facing a high unemployment rate and a high murder rate.
As the international officials of the North and Central American countries progressed, they submitted a high-level conference to address safety and economic well-being in order to address the conclusions of a similar convention from last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
In mid-September, the top-level officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thereby cutting off any consideration of the sanctions against El Salvador.
The diplomats say that now at a conference scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is expected to be a signal showing that he is invited to attend the meetings of representatives of the administration.
Three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and Dominicans, and none of these were accompanied by any new raw messages or penalties from Washington.
The Ombudsman, John Bolton, of the White House, refused to comment on the details of the debates which were presented by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal perceptions, provided that anonymity was assured.
Their relations were confirmed by an external analyst from the administration's environment, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn History
Another part of this could be the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on possible obstacles to justice by President Trump, as evidence currently available to the public.
According to reports, Robert Mueller's investigation also examined whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with Russia's attack on American elections.
If Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable by him in preparing for reintroduction before the voters, perhaps even before the jury.
There are a lot of unwitting people here, and I do not want to suggest that the collapse of Trump — or those in equal positions in Europe — is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic which will decide how long it can take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
It didn't work out, and we lost the chance to avoid the years of slaughter that happened.
The circles of history revolve around such turning points, accelerating or slowing down an inevitable origin of democracy.
There are a few of these turning points in front of the Americans right now.
What do we do if Donald Trump fires off the Attorney General of Rod Rosenstein, the man who cares about Robert Mueller's future investigation?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since we revealed in our paper that last year he offered a mysterious recording of the president and was speculating that he was not fit for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the account presented by The Times is not accurate.
“How will we react if the FBI’s newly commissioned investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if it is appointed as Judge of the Supreme Court, despite being pregnant with credible sexual assault charges and making false statements?
First of all, are we going to choose, in the middle of the presidential term, people who will be held responsible for Donald Trump’s duties?
If we don't get through these trials, we're gonna have a tough time for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed — because of the lessons I have received in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over my ambassador residence.
She lived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light the sabbas candles on that table marked with a plum.
Having an inheritance like this, how could I not look into the future optimistically?"

Player of the Rangers, Graham Dorrans, is waiting for a match with the Rapid Vienna team
Rangers take Rapid Vienna on Thursday with knowledge that the victory with Austria, obtained after an impressive remission with Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying from the G League of Europe.
Until the draw 2:2 with Villareal contusion of the knee prevented the assistant Graham Dorrans from playing the game this season, but he believes that this result will work on the Rangers like a trampoline to be more successful.
"It was good for us because Villarreal is in good shape," said 31-year-old.
“We went to this game with faith that we would achieve something — and we had won a point.
Perhaps at the end we could still squeeze them, but overall the draw is probably a just result.
The Spanish were probably better in the first half, but in the second, we were better.
As for Thursday, it is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we can get three points, but this game will be difficult because our opponent has won a good score in his last game. However, I am sure that thanks to the fans we will get through and we will win a positive result.
The last year was definitely hard because of everything about my injury and changes in the club itself, but now we're all well in our places.
The team's great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Fear of pension savings spends a dream on women's eyes
Even though people in the survey knew exactly how they wanted them to be taken care of, not many were talking about it with their family.
In a study conducted by Nationwide about half of the participants concluded that she had talked to her spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking about it with the kids.
“People want their family member to take care of them, but do not talk about them” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide company selling life insurance.
Where do I start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family for care if you do not express your will before.
With your advisor and your family talk about where and how you want to be taken care of, because this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask for assistance to the financial advisor: He can help you find a way to pay these expenses.
Long-term care funds may come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that allows you to pay cash to cover such expenses, or from your own property, if you own it.
Prepare legal documents: You'll prevent this case from happening.
Set up a trusted healthcare agent to oversee and ensure that people do their best if communication becomes impossible.
Consider also the employment of a plenipotentiary who will deal with financial matters.
Choose a trusted person, because she will make financial decisions for you and ensure that all accounts are paid if you can't do it yourself.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical attention, and he's just going to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about drugs and allergies?
You'll have all the information you need to get them ready.
“It’s not just about finance, it’s about who doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It's worth having a plan with you."
Male repeatedly shot from a windmill in Ilfracombe
The man was shot repeatedly from the windmill when he came home from the evening party.
Four hundred-year-olds were located near Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe County, Devon, when he was shot in a chest, stomach and hand.
Police have identified shootings that took place around 02:30 BST time as a “by chance”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries that have been suffered do not threaten the man's life, and police are asking for witnesses to be reported.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died from a massive earthquake and tsunami that had been visited on Friday by the Indonesian city of Palu.
No information from Donggala, which is north of Pala, could be obtained from the broken communication to the rescuers, which is closer to the 7.5 degree earthquake epicentre.
After the Pale disaster, more than 16 000 people were evacuated.
Here are some important information about the city of Palu and the Donggala convertible on the island of Celebes:
The palace is the capital of Celebes Central, a province situated at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island. According to estimates in 2017, 379 800 people lived.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the 40th anniversary of the city lasted.
Donggala is a Kabupaten (administrative unit below the province) extending along the north-west coast of the island over 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299 200 people.
The main branches of the Central Celebes economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed especially in the area of the Donggala Kabupatie coast.
Another source of revenue for the province is nickel mines, but they are mainly in Morála, on the opposite coast of Celebesu.
According to the information from the Indonesian Convening Agency for Katastro in the last 100 years, earthquakes and tsunami have been visited several times by Pal and Donggala.
In 1938, the tsunami that hit Donggala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunami in West Donggali.
Indonesia is located in the active seismic Pacific ring fire, which makes earthquakes quite regular there.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake, which visited the western coast of Aceh on the north of Sumatra on 26 December, caused tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226 000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, of which more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, the western coast of Sumatra visited a series of powerful earthquakes.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In the south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, there was an earthquake of 6.8 degrees, causing tsunami in the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: There was an earthquake of 7.6 degrees near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
As a result, more than 1100 people died.
2010: A 7,5 degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai near the Sumatra coast. It caused a tsunami wave of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Pidie Jaya in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic among people who continued to remember the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami wave, but more than 100 were killed by the rolling buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes visited Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its northern side.
They caused the destruction of thousands of houses and brought temporary problems for thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sara Palin arrested under domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President, Sara Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from the town of Wasilla, a 29-year-old boy was arrested with domestic violence charges, hindering the application and resisting arrest.
According to a police report when a suspect's friend tried to call the police to file a criminal record, he took her phone.
The KTUU reports that Palin is in the Mat-Su investigation arrest and has a designated bail of $500.
According to her information last Saturday, he was in court, where he said in his defense speech that he was "unlessly innocent".
Three class A offenses, which means he can receive even a year in prison and $20,000 fine.
He was also accused of a class B offense, for which he was threatened with a penalty of $2,000 in prison and fine.
It's not the first time that Palin's charges are imposed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Icelandic court of veto claims.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, hindering the submission and possession of weapons in a state of unscrupulousness in connection with this incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, the Veterans group criticized Sara Palin, who linked aggressive behaviour of her son with post-traumatic stress syndrome, which he experienced during his ministry in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died from tsunami after the earthquake in Indonesia.
At least 384 people died from the fifth earthquake, which was visited by the Indonesian island of Celebes.
A 7.5 degree earthquake caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located to the north east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
In social media, films show disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held, there were hundreds of people.
Federal prosecutors demand death sentences for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City.
Federal prosecutors from New York demand the death penalty for Sayfulla Saip, suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York, resulting in the death of eight people. It is a rare punishment — has not been executed in this state for a federal offence since 1953.
The attack took place in October on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, allegedly used the hired truck Home Depot, which ran the pedestrians and bikers on his way.
According to a report made in the South District of New York about the intention of demanding a death penalty in order to justify its necessity, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sappov killed eight victims “generally” and“ purposely” caused serious injury to the body.
According to a court order for both of these charges, there is a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Justice has presented Saipov with an act of prosecution involving 22 counts, including eight charges for murder in illegal activity — which is usually used by federal prosecutors in matters concerning organised crime — and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, organising the attack required “solid planning and reflection”. The way Saipov conducted it was described as “holy, cruel and immoral.”
“Sayfullo Habibullavic Saipov brought harm, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariela Erlija, Hernan Feruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci,” states the announcement of intent.
Five of the victims were the citizens of Argentina who were in New York for tourism.
The last time about the death penalty in New York's Southern District was ten years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but finally, in September 2009, he heard a life sentence.
The death penalty was done last time in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Marriage was executed after two years earlier they were declared guilty of conspiracy and espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's court documents, which came from Uzbekistan, within months of the attack, there was no remorse.
Police say he told the investigators he's fine with what he's done.
According to the act of Saipov's accusation, he told the authorities that he was inspired by ISIS films that he was watching the phone.
According to the police, he also claimed to hang an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He's innocent of 22 charges on charges.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders of the state who represent Sappov, said that they were "for obvious reasons disappointed" by the DA's decision.
"We consider that the decision to demand death penalty and to reject life without prior release after the confession of guilt will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought to all the persons concerned," he said.
Sappov's defense team has asked the prosecutors not to demand a death penalty before that.
A Tories parliamentary officer says that NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
During today's protest, which took place during the Torys conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people."
Former Head of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians had to "get hot" from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's parliamentarians suggested that they should take responsibility for negotiating with the European Union.
President Peter Bone, who had been sent to the Birmingham demonstration that if Farage were Secretary of Brexit, the United Kingdom would have been out of the Union.
However, joining the Tories of opting for staying together in a separate protest against Brexit, as it was held in the city, has further underlined the burden of the task of reconciling its deeply divided ranks, as it stands in front of Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement his compromise plan with Chequers among the attacks on the part of Brexit supporters, its opponents, as well as the European Union itself.
Its allies claim that despite its opposition, they will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and to force the Eurosceptics and the lamurists to choose between its proposal and its 'chaos'.
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull that he wanted to "excuse the plan from Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should become a proxy to whom responsibility should be given for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did this, we would now be out of the Union," he said.
Deputed from Wellingborough added: "I support Brexit, but we have to throw away a plan from Chequers."
In his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in world wars for this to be subject to people now.
We want to be our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestions that citizens had changed their mind from voting in 2016: “He thought that the British had changed their mind and wanted to stay in the Union is completely false.”
At the demonstration, there was also a supporting Brexit Andrea Jenkyns from the Tories group, who told the reporters: “I'm just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
The plan with Chequers does not support the general, the opposition will not vote for it, our party or our activists, who are reinventing the streets and who have chosen us, do not support it either.
Please drop your plan with Chequers and start listening."
According to Prime Minister May, she added: "He measures his standing when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage stated that the politicians involved in the demonstration had to "get hot" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a question of trust between us — the people — and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and today we're here to tell them we won't let you do this."
When he asked for a diverse crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the edge of the betrayal of Brexit feel hot.
"We are the army of the people of this country who has given us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
During that time, the opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where two hours of demonstration took place.
A bunch of activists waved the banners of "Torys against Brexit" after they formed the group this weekend.
Activists, Baron Andrew Adonis, laughed up conservatives for problems with the safety of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who claim to set up IT systems and technology to handle Canada's plan plus plus, smooth borderline, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
“It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren is planning to "priorly consider" presidential candidate
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, "he will carefully consider running for president".
According to The Boston Globe, a representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a meeting with the voters that took place on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will apply for re-launch in November. Its opponent will be representatives of the Republicans Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chairing Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 elections.
It is now said that Warren can defeat Trump in the 2020 elections.
The Saturday event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the formula town hall since Donald Trump took over office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government — and also means a woman on the mountain itself.
Arresting a mortal shooter who killed the LSU team player, Wayde Sims
Police from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, informed on Saturday about a suspect's arrest on Friday's shooting, where a basketball player from LSU, Wayde Sims died.
The police department in Baton Rouge informed of the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the conference that took place at 11:00 Eastern Time.
On Friday there was a video from a shooting room asking for help in identifying a man visible on it.
Two-year-old Wayde Sims died of a gunshot wound near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot with firearms in his head, resulting in death," said the media chief of police, Murphy J. Paul, according to service 247sports.
Wayde stood up to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, carrying a gun and shooting at Wayde.
After the detention, during which he was not resisting, he was transferred to custody in East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The 1.98 m junior Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games, and started 10 times in the last season, during which he spent 17.4 minutes on the parking floor, he won 5.6 points, and he scored 2.9 games for the game.
Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after the team's command enabled him to win with Sebastian Vettel
Since Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the command of the Mercedes team would have a big impact on the race outcome.
Bottas, who started from the first field, began very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vetella to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the service post first and allowed Hamilton to go to the peleton tail, which should decide the fate of the race.
The Mercedes player went to boxing in the next round and appeared in Vettel, but after a round in a circle, which led the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the internal part of the track, risking the push to defensy after a double movement rival with the aim of defending position on the third turn, Hamilton set out to run.
Max Verstappen started at the end of the bet, and his 21st birthday at the end of the first round was on the seventh place.
Then, through a large part of the race, he did not change the tires to make a quick finish and to take Kimi Raikkonen fourth position.
Finally, he went to the service post on the 44th round, but in the other eight laps he no longer speeded up.
“It was a tough day, because Valteri was doing a great job all weekend, and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The whole team gave it all to take two first places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
During the meeting that took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump recorded with Senator Diana Feinstein, who maintained that she did not disclose the contents of the letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused the nominated judge of Brett Kavanaugh's highest court of sexual assault.
When speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to the statements made by Christina Ford before the Committee on Justice. Instead, he said that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "under, mean and liars".
“What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have witnessed for several days, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, mean, evil and liars” he said.
"We see what was published and revealed, and then they tell us 'oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose it to her."
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we did not reveal," added the senator.
Diana Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and his contents leaked in early September.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s innuendo, I did not reveal her history,” said Feinstein before the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me for discretion and according to her request, I did not disclose the contents."
Her statement, however, did not convince the president, who commented on them during the Saturday meeting: “I speak to you, that was a really bad speech.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen in my life."
By continuing to defend the candidate for judge of the Supreme Court, whose three women accused of sexual harassment, the President suggested that Democrats use insinuations for their own purposes.
‘They are determined to take over all measures.
You can see the severity, the malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they must destroy, to take over power and control," said the president, according to mediaite's reports.

Air traffic controller dies helping hundreds of people in the plane escape from earthquakes
Air traffic controller from Indonesia was shouted out to be a hero after he died, helping a plane take off safely with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people died, and many were considered missing after a large earthquake, which hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, causing tsunami.
There are still severe secondary shocks in the area. Many people were trapped in rubbles in Palu.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave her post in a popular flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was there to ensure that the Batik Air (lot 6321) plane, which was on the runway, was safely launched.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought he was gonna fall apart.
He died in a hospital.
According to reports from ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, the controller's decision was likely to save hundreds of people.
We organized a helicopter from the town of Balikpapan on Borneo to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
“This message gave us heart,” he added.
However, the authorities are afraid that the number of fatalities can reach thousands. The national agency for the elimination of the consequences of disasters informs that the possibility of reaching the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“We see that the harvest of death is still increasing, because many bodies are still under rubble and cannot be reached”” said the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
The six-meter tsunami waves destroyed the Pala, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian planes provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News: “The Ambulans keep bringing their bodies.
There's not enough drinking water.
Small stores are plundered."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross has been hurrying to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will stop.
It's already a tragedy, or maybe even worse."
On Sunday, President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, who asked the army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to do all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
This year Indonesia has already visited an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on Lombok Island.
Micronesia aircraft disaster — Air Niugini’s lines report that one person is missing after the plane crashed on the lagoon
Airline serving the flight, which crashed on the lagoon in Micronesis in Pacific, informs that one person is missing. Previously, they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the drowning aircraft.
Air Niugini reported that according to the Saturday afternoon data, they couldn't count on one man who traveled a big plane.
They made sure that, together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, they were trying to find him.
However, they did not reply immediately to the request for additional details concerning the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while attempting to land on the island of Chuuk, the remaining passengers and crew members were helping local boats.
The officials informed on Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline said there were six other passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all stable.
It is not clear what caused the crash, but it is also unknown to its exact course.
The United States Airline and the US Navy claim that the plane landed on the lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell out of a belt.
American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was very low.
“It helped us very much” he said.
Jaynes said he managed to get other people through a water belt to get out of an emergency sink.
According to him, the cabin crew were panicking and screaming, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy has informed that they also helped sailors who worked nearby to upgrade the coast. By means of a blown boat, they managed to transport people on the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database in the last two decades, the aircraft belonging to the airlines registered in Papua New Guinea lost 111 people. However, there are no Air Niugini among these lines.
Analytical restored the events of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the D.A. ended the presentation of evidence in the retrial of a man accused of being burned alive by a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Justice Department, Paul Rowlett, has been testifying for many hours as a court-class intelligence analysis.
He described to the judges how, through cell phone records, he restored the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
As Clarion Ledger reports, Rowlett said he was getting data on the location from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers on a big night.
When the data confirmed that at a time when Quinton was supposed to be with his friends, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was with Jessica Chambers, the police decided to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford said he wasn't in town.
When asked by the prosecutors about whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was staying in Sanford's truck that night, he said that he was "he lied because my truck was in Nashville then."
Another inconsistencies are Tellis's claim that Chambers has known for about two weeks.
Cell phone records have shown that they've known each other just a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her contact details from her phone as well as texts and connections.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The final defence is due on Sunday.
The judge said that the case would probably be handed over to the jury the same day.

Another black one?
Nanny from New York is suing some for release after a "racist" text-ie
Nanny from New York is suing her from her work on racist background after receiving a misrepresented SMS in which her mother complains that she is "another black person".
The couple disagrees as if they were racist, comparing the lawsuits to an "abort."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly constered when it turned out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who was on her first day at work in 2016, was black.
“NONEE, THE CLEAR OF THE OSOBA” wrote in a text to her husband.
But instead of sending him to him, she sent him twice to Mrs Maurice by mistake.
According to reports of the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman was aware of the gaff, the "swiped" released Gisella Maurice, claiming that the cordial nanny, who is African-American, was wrong to perform her duties and, moreover, she expected a nanny from the Philippines.
Mrs Maurice got paid for her work day, and then she was sent home to Uber.
Now it demands a pair of compensation for an exemption of 350 dollars a day multiplied for six months, for which it was originally employed with residence, although it did not sign the contract.
"I want to show them that such things are not done," said Post on Friday and added, "I know that this is discrimination."
The couple denied the allegations of racism, claiming that the termination of cooperation with Mrs Maurice was justified, because after they insulted her, they feared that they would not be able to trust her.
“ My wife sent something to her that she wasn’t going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said Post's husband, Joel Plasco.
“ Would you entrust your children to the person you made sorry even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
In comparing the lawsuit to the "survivor", Plasco said that his wife had only two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you intend to blow something like this?
It's not very nice," he added to the investment banker.
Although the case has not yet ended, the public opinion has rapidly given rise to a few judgments in social media, criticizing it for her behaviour and thinking.
The new letter reveals that Paddington's book publishers were afraid that readers would not feel ties with talking missions.
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the warm welcome of the book, says of the letter: “It is hard to place himself in the place of the person who read it for the first time, even before the book was published.
It's very funny now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He claims that her father, who, before the little plush bear inspired him to write a book for children, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected. He also added that after his death last year, the book published by him seems “sweet and bitter”.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family”, says her father was in secret proud of his success.
“He was a silent man, he did not boast,” he adds.
“ However, because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something — you feel pride of him, although not your merit.
I think Paddington's success was more or less perceived.
Although he invented it himself and created it, he always deserved Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter was landed, she was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors in vain tried to save her life.
“He called regularly and said it was really bad that he probably wouldn’t come out of it” says Tanya Ednan-Laperous.
“Then he called to say that Natasha will die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that told her doctor to keep her heart attack were slow to stop working and were eliminated from her body.
She died a while earlier, and that was the end of everything.
All I could do was sit there and wait for them to know that this whole thing is growing.
I couldn't even scream or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to stick to it."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, has boarded along with other passengers, the unconscious through whom the torments passed.
"No one knew," she said.
I had my head blown off, and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt all the heartening compassion for Nada.
I felt she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Posts from women in mourning are intended to help prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide try to lead others away from the intention of taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put in the Welsh mail bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers where people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he got depressed, and he took his own life at age 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel like I feel every day” — he says.
The 45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydia, says that her son was a well-announced cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They always said that he could brighten up every room in it."
But before he died, he quit his job because he was "in a really black place."
In 2014, Brother Tyler was 11 and he was the one who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domina effect."
Sharon Davis created a note “to tell people that there are people to whom you can turn and talk to, even if they are just friends.
Don't sit quietly, talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother's death, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years.
“He didn’t say he felt beaten, sad or anything” he said.
“For a few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his conduct.
He was already in the hole at Christmas, and when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It rips up the hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in Italian because the FBI launches an investigation
“I thought that if we could actually achieve what he asked for — a limited investigation of time and extent — perhaps we could achieve some unanimity” — said Jeff Flake on Saturday, and added that he was afraid that the committee would “fall” to the opposite camps, leading to an impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
They're all due momentarily.
The elections to Congress are already in a few weeks — 6 November. If, according to predictions, Republicans lose them, the chances of choosing a certain person to the highest court in the country are indeed being reduced.
George W. Bush was already picking up his phone to call the senators and get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House, and by him he met his wife Ashley, who was a personal secretary of the president.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will be voted in the Senate.
It is not certain that Brett Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes from senators, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring him into the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's governments, the number of refugees from North Korea is shrinking.
According to the South Korean legislator since seven years ago Kim Jong Un took over, the number of people fleeing from North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
To quote data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, Park Byeong-seug said that last year there were 1127 escapes, and in 2011 — 2706.
According to him, the key factors affecting this situation are more accurate controls on the border between North Korea and China and higher rates of traffickers.
Pjongyang did not issue a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are finally proposed citizenship of South Korea.
According to the authorities in Seoul since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 Koreans from the North have illegally crossed the border.
The majority are fleeing from China, which has the longest border with North Korea, so it is easier to cross it than the strictly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between both Korea.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back to their country.
Relations between North and South, which theoretically remain at war, have clearly improved in recent months.
This month the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks about the negotiations on denuclearisation that had previously become a dead point.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong Un, held in Singapore in June. The fruit of this meeting is a general agreement on the pursuit of the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of no progress on this issue.
"Without confidence in the United States, we will not be sure about our national security and under these circumstances there is no possibility that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri said before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "histeric" and claims he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, named the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavana 'histeric' and said that it was naturally not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave these words during the interview she gave on Saturday during Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman acted like this, she would be recognized as a "herster," said Pelosi about his response to the testimony that Kavanaugh had made on Thursday before the Committee on Justice.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the alleged sexual harassment of Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the time of his speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — almost screaming and losing speech when discussing family and high school issues.
He also reportedly to the Democrats from the committee, identifying the implications of a "grotesque and coordinated reputation attack" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudice to the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way the Clintons and Democrats were attacked," she said.
Asked whether she would have tried to appeal Kavanaugh from office if he had received the nomination and if the Democrats had gained the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi had hesitated.
"I say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also in this court, where he is currently working," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently judge in Colombia's district appeal court.
Pelosi added that as Democrat, he was afraid of possible decisions by Kavanaugh on the Affordable Care Act Act Act Act or Roe v. Wade's trial, because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing confirming Kavanaugh questioned whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to enter into the historical court, a prejudiced person who will expect us to say 'always are wonderful'," Pelos added.
And women have to play it.
It's the right diatribe, months and years of spilling fury, and she can't throw it out without crying.
“We cry when we're angry,” said Gloria Stein 45 years later.
"That's quite common, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was a manager in a company helped me greatly, and she said that she was crying when she was angry, but she came up with this way that when she got nervous and started crying, she was talking to a person she's talking to, 'You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad.
And he's still doing his job.
I thought it was brilliant."
Lies are allowed as an outbreak of anger in part because they are basically wrongly understood.
One of my most obvious memories of one of the first positions in an office dominated by men is how one day I began to cry out of the unfamiliar rage. A warm older woman — a cool manager that I was always a little afraid — took me for a neck and led me to a stairway.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she said.
“They don’t know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and they're happy to see you're finished."
Patricia Schroeder from the Democratic Party, then deputized to Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat named Monkey Business and withdrawn from the race, frustrated to Patricia's borders, she realized that it might be possible to consider, in fact, the idea of self-dating the president.
"This was not a thought-out decision," she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“The election was already made by seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone identified this situation as the "Snow Snow" and the seven dwarfs.
Since the campaign has lasted for a long time, Schroeder has been in a position to collect funds and has promised herself that she will not join the race if she doesn't collect $2 million.
It was a defeat battle.
She then discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men 1,000 dollars, had only 250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts?” she wondered.
During the speech she announced that she would not carry out the formal campaign, she was so emotional — grateful for those who supported her, frustration because of the system that made it so difficult to collect money and turn to voters, not delegates, and rage toward sexism — that she had put her voice in her throat.
“You might think that I've gone through a nervous breakdown,” says the press.
“You might think that Kleenex is sponsoring me.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"She cried?"
What the benefits of Beijing's economic war between the United States and China
The chambers that began the economic war between the US and China were deafening and although the battles still persist, in the long term the conflict between these countries could be beneficial for Beijing, say experts.
The first warning fired this year by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposing duties on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new duty rates on goods worth USD 200 billion (150 billion pounds), which resulted in half of all goods arriving in the USA from China.
Every time Beijing retaliated in nature, raising duties on US goods of USD 60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to any US impact and it does not appear that the second economy in the world is about to end.
Forced Washington to withdraw means accepting demands, but the public deviation from head ahead of the United States would be too embarrassing for the president of China, Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing played well its cards, the US trade war pressure could strengthen China in a long term, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a political rapid decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the economic chaos of some countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers have already been granted," said Abigail Grace, a researcher dealing with Asia in the Think tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Syria is "ready" to return refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding the country ruined by more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Mual, said that the conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation in our territory is now more stable and safe thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
In order to restore normality, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been fulfilled so that refugees who have to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic shifts measured in their daily lives and means of maintenance can freely return to it.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million people left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The next six million people who still live there need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mual said that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept assistance in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept the aid provided or offered by the countries which sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seales the victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018, defeating the U.S. team with a score of 16,5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
On European Earth, the United States has already lost its sixth time in a row and since 1993 have not won the Ryder Cup cup in Europe.
Europe recovered a trophy when, under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it received 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who did not go well through most of the tournament, was hit by a ball from the base straight to the water at the 16th hole of the PAR3, thus giving the match to Francesc Molini.
The Italian golfer Molinari flashed through all rounds and became one of four players since 1979, when it was the first time this tournament was held in the current format, it was able to get a score of 5-0.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated as a result of 5&4 by the lowest player in Europe ranking, Thorbjorna Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who has the highest position in the world ranking, lost two holes before the last hole with the Englishman Ian Poulter, for which he might have already been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
A European with the greatest wins in Ryder Cup was Spain Sergio Garcia, who had already participated in eight such tournaments and received 25,5 career points.
“I don’t normally cry, but I can’t stop today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm very happy to see you get your toes back.
This is a success of the entire team and I am pleased to be able to help," said Garcia, after winning the team from Europe.
He conveys to his native, John Rahm, who beat the single American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday, the result of 2&1.
“I feel an incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game,” said Rahm 23.
Woods lost all the matches in France and now has 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
This is unusual statistics, like one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and only gave up to Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team has had problems finding a current all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the tournament at a really high level.
After his American captain Jim Furyk’s disappointing performance, he said: “I’m proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pressed some Europeans.
We're back.
Headcaps in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of surprises for the opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
