The Prague Stock Exchange fell to the end of the trading
After the early fall, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected losses.
The transaction with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange began trading on its Monday fall when it fell by almost six percent.
This time the fall is worth losing stock on Wall Street.
In this way, we have a market response to the result of the US House of Representatives, which has refused to support the stabilisation plan of the financial sector there.
Exchange of shares in Asia
The dramatic fall on Tuesday experienced stock at stock exchanges in Asia, although the indexes finally deleted part of the loss during the day.
The Hang Seng Exchange Index in Hong Kong recorded nearly four percent during the trade, later on, but some of the losses were deleted and the decline reduced to about 2.5 percent.
The index of Hang Seng China Enterprises, which monitors China's stock movements at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has fallen by 3.8 percent, the markets in Shanghai have been closed.
Stocks at the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but eventually losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The storm in Taiwan, according to the index, has fallen by 3.6 percent.
"The timing of rescue action in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets throughout the world," noted Joseph Yam, Head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, the monetary policy determines itself, i.e. regardless of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong's interest rates are the same as the United States.
According to Austrian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should promptly return to the negotiations and propose to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a danger that other countries will feel the impact.
A bloodbath of American shares
The US Chamber of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system for which up to $700 billion was to be spent on Monday (at least CZK 12 trillion).
The legislators ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
American shares have experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices have seen the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
Dow Jones' index has fallen by almost seven percent and has seen a similar decline in 1987 for the last time.
Index had already fallen before the vote, but once it turned out that the proposal had not passed in the House, the index had been found in a free fall.
Congress resigned: US government can pump $700 billion into the bank
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed to a wider form of financial assistance agreements for the US financial system.
The vote on him will be at the beginning of next week.
American legislators have made breakthroughs in interviews to approve a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately CZK 12 trillion).
But it is not won yet.
Congressmen must complete some of the details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Agent Reuters told the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the House Barney Frank.
In the Senate, according to sources, it might be possible to vote on the plan first on Wednesday.
According to economists, notification should be made that the rescue plan will be approved, the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, it will then be 'cut-off' due to the complexity of mechanisms to help markets also in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have solved our differences in views on how to look like a market stabilization package," said Nancy Pelosi, for Bloomberg.
According to her, a final vote might be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with the US Treasury Minister Henry Paulson to give their definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy away from financial companies unsale mortgage assets that attract financial firms to severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive plan agreement that will work and must also be effective on the market.
It is still necessary to continue in the healing plan, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has markedly hit stock markets which are falling rapidly.
According to the Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a definitive agreement on Sunday in Congress.
They want to calm the investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first ones in the time zone, where Congress's decision could affect Monday's trade.
However, it is not yet clear whether both chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law or whether they cannot hold any trouble at the last moment.
The legislators hope he will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will learn a number of changes.
The total amount to be allocated to the aid to the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
The starting $35 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
Congress may block the release of the remaining amounts if it feels that the programme does not fulfil its function, namely in the sequence of another $100 billion and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
While the President may welcome this decision, Congress may vote on it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was to obtain finance for the redemption of bad mortgage securities, whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to repay their mortgages, maintained.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Jud Gregg.
The US President Bush is satisfied with progress in the negotiations.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates the 'responsible effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economies'.
Limitation of gold parachutes
President of the Senate Committee Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiator, said that the legislators agreed to be responsible for the money program, protection of taxpayers from losses, closure of reliefs, timing of financing of the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called gold parachutes for the directors of the company participating in the programme and to establish a committee that will have over the supervisory fund.
He should run the Treasury.
"We have worked very hard on it and made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also counts with the help of homeowners who have problems paying off.
The government should negotiate new instalments for mortgages it will buy in order to reduce the monthly cost of repayments for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance David Mark's main economy, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because it doesn't know what mechanism it is and what cost the problem assets will be bought out.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will split up between each other," said Marek for the iHNed.cz server this week.
If the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week, it is not so substantial according to Mark.
"The more important thing to do this week is by the congresmans to agree that this plan is supported and that it will be explained as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on approval is now the most important," said Marek.
Game against blades: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We can manage how to choose
While almost every phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Yet, there are enough reasons for a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on how to use it and the future owner's corners.
I guess it's hard for you to get your home a top expensive turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
However, such music products do not come out on LP boards, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for it.
However, if you blame yourself in your racks for art rock, jazz or blues, you may at least dream of such turntable.
It's the same with music on the road, which is a complicated music, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and qualitative categories.
For someone it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on the player, as well as Pink Floyd fan, it may be difficult to bite the headphones for twenty crowns from the marketplace.
Two extremities between which is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Determines and maintain the battery
Some top music players can do much more than just playing music, but what most mobiles do not happen.
No current device is as universal as a phone.
In addition to primary functions, phone and texting, he can play music and video, record both, he has the better, the worse camera, and maybe even navigation.
And if we take smartphones and comms into question, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, but no fridge knows how to grill and no TV takes photographs.
Cell universality also brings disadvantages.
The more you use your mobile functions, the sooner the indicator will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the greatest jocks of energy.
A small cell phone can play music for more than ten 12 hours, mostly it's much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are much more efficient.
For cheap phones, therefore, calculate that you will not be playing for more than a few hours.
If you still have one more charger in there, get another charger to work in order to be sure - that also applies to more expensive devices.
You will not have this problem with MP3 players, even the worse ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on one charge.
Another problem arises when recording music to your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only few card readers can consult with miniature memory cards that are used in phones without reduction.
You don't need any special software for players except for exceptions (ipods).
All you have to do is fill the device with a USB music from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players already create a music library classified by the name of the interpreter, the name of the album, the genre or the user rating.
Some devices display only tree structure of directories similar to the Windows Explorer and some of them do (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobiles more know
When selecting a particular device, take into account in particular the maintenance of the battery, the capacity of memory, quality and type of sound output, and, of course, the comfort of control.
If your music is primarily a stage and if you listen to it every day just for a short time in a tram, you just need any phone that plays MP3.
Which can already really be almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to follow what music formats a cell phone or player can do.
MP3 will handle all and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will be in this format.
It is part of the widest and besides most instruments can also make music in the format WMA.
AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
For example, better phones also allow purchase of online music.
Just via the mobile internet visit the operator's appropriate website (or another provider) and a song or album to buy.
This service could already be a valid argument for the acquisition of a musical cell.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is mostly limited to speedy radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest, either.
However, it is generally assumed that this is the method of selling music (although over GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) to the future there is a music industry.
Most people still carry a cell phone.
Whenever you want to listen to something, your phone in your pocket will taste it, while the MP3 player is locked away at home.
But it still depends on whether you always carry headphones with you, or at least wire hands-free.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every cell phone, but only a minimum MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest is usually under three thousand.
In three and four thousand crowns, you will be given a very decent walkman.
Usually, however, you will be reduced by the absence of output to common headphones.
The best and technically equipped phones with a 3.5 mm lid for common headphones are up to 15,000.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy service.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can control really everyone.
Minimum function, similarity control with a previously common tape recorder, or perhaps a turntable.
There is no risk of collisions in the form of a mistake on-line mobile and then a huge account for data transfer.
After which apparatus to touch
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have a slot on the exchange memory card (type M2, microSD, etc.).
And with the purchase of the appropriate cards, you will walk into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive will be able to handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, tap Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not need to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding audiences, you better bet on specialized mobile phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungy).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is so close to a separate MP3 player.
The Sony Ericsson section, whose Walkman phones have the same user interface as the sold alone MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to CZK 4 000, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and the battery capacity (within the course of 15 hours, up to 35 hours), the MP3 players will be able to remove from the above mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here-- a virtual operator who's gonna make the classics go off.
Maybe she won't be long.
About the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobil.cz many times.
This was confirmed by the Czech Republic, which pointed out that the SMS price is higher than in the rest of the Union.
Following the recent steps of the European Commission on the regulation of roaming charges, there may be a paradoxic situation - text messages from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are held so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to get into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxically, we've got three mobile networks here, and we've got a penetration rate of over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to play that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this too often the Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Council (CTO) Pavel Dvořák, who has expressed several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classic operator with its own network apparently no longer has much chances (although, it would probably be difficult to search for frequencies already).
But there is one other possibility - a virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market brought a significant reduction in prices, which then had to react to by classical operators.
Yet, before the entry of the nets like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, similar votes were applied to the market in the UK.
But it turns out that the place for these operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we don't have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to get over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:phone in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to work effectively, much less customers are enough for them than the classic operator.
They do not carry relatively high construction, operation and maintenance costs.
In the world, virtual operators tend to profile themselves as low-cost operators - offering cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by the easier offering of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half a cheap one than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move as well as a bet on an unafraid target group.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"Administrative men elect Mobilking - an operator they like and whom they can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is hard to say if a concept like Poland could catch with us.
It doubts Vodafon's press secretary Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, in terms of the offer, the service is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic without chance, they call mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobileking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations do not seem too promising in the Czech Republic.
More likely, Mobilking will start in other countries of our region," said Jan Studničková, spokesperson of the financial group Penta in the phone interview for Mobil.cz.
In fact, she confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to do so.
On the contrary, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor does.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has been no longer covered by the GTS Novera group, which would like to take a further step towards becoming the real competitor of Telefónika O2 on the company customers' field.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only solid, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have dealt repeatedly with all the Czech mobile operators about this possibility.
We have already managed to proceed with some of them," says Pavel Kaidl, Press spokesperson.
Well, maybe it's for better times.
Official information seems that the first virtual operator should be looking forward to the end of the year.
For the time being, it is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this point, we do not think that there is room for a full virtual operator on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any subject with a complex and serious project in this area," said Vlastimil Sršeň from Telefónika O2 in his opinion on Mobil.cz.
More operators are also referring to the specificity of the Czech market.
The press spokesperson of T-Mobile Martin Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the expression O2: "We have not yet noticed any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which it would be possible to build further."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network, it's hard for some virtual operator to appear by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table so that it can be considered in this short term."
Vodafone prefers its attention to meeting the requirements of its 3G license.
Miroslav Chepický says: "We are open to one with potential virtual operators, especially in terms of sharing costs and infrastructure.
We consider that to be the most profitable in terms of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is finding a partner for building a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thereby a decrease in their profits.
Why, then, would it make it easier for a competitor to take up such a challenge?
The fact that when the operators are involved, they pull one rope is also evidenced by the tahaics around the formation of U:phone.
Probably the biggest pressure towards ČTÚ went at the time of the formation of U:phone from T-Mobile.
It shall bear witness to this publicly available information from the website of the Czech Republic.
Now, however, U:phon fits as an argument why the virtual operator doesn't accept.
Martina Kemr said: "The business environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would put high demands on it and above all on its services."
In view of this access to mobile operators, however, it is directly stunning by the lack of interest of Czech regulatory authorities.
This is not just about the position of the Czech Republic, which, unfortunately, unlike the United Kingdom and other developed countries, does not have the power to interfere with competition.
These belong exclusively to the Competition Protection Authority (OOHS).
But he took his typical attitude to the whole issue.
"The access of a virtual operator to the mobile market would be possible once the contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for renting the necessary infrastructure was concluded.
No such contract has been concluded until now, as the offer of potential candidates was probably not interesting enough for the classic operators," he said in response to our question, Kristian Chalupa, from the ÚOHS Department of External Relations.
The operator’s representatives may not be surprised by this formulated expression.
From the Office to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one is using his market position is more than considered.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "Where virtual operators normally work, we can see that their entry to the market has contributed to reducing prices for mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the fair functioning of the market environment and the decline in prices does not fall within the interests of the ÚOHS.
In fact, it is shocking on the whole case that the three mobile operators have a strong consensus that results from their reactions.
The question, if it really is just a coincidence, is offered entirely by itself.
As well as the same price of petrol at the pumping stations, it is certainly only a part of a coincidence and a hard competition struggle.
"The public has not found any signs of action in this matter, and therefore there is no reason to interfere in some way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, so it has no corresponding increased responsibility for their market negotiations.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators probably come together to the telecommunications controller," Chalupa said.
Interpreting the dominant position on the market is one of many points in dispute.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is the only market in competition.
Of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always needed to create a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator - has quite logically - on its network monopoly.
So in a certain segment, it must necessarily be dominant.
However, even if we did not accept this argument, it should be at least warning that the three mobile operators act conspicuously in similar ways.
In the meantime, complaints from a number of interested parties (including those mentioned by GTS Novera) show that there are very similar obstacles in dealing with all operators.
Sacrifice of responsibility on the ČTÚ is then in telecommunications a fairly common trick, which ÚOHS gives away from the whole business.
We've met him in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendments to the Telecommunications Act with the extension of the competence of the ČTÚ to competition in telecommunications did not succeed, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
This must be known by representatives of the ÚOHS more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's when no one's looking.
The operation of some pseudo-virtual operators in Czech mobile networks remains unnoticed.
They are companies issuing their own pricelists of mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
Usually, it's a multilevel marketing company.
The own mobile phone service thus offers Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
Prices of these companies usually get to the chosen ones.
The spell lies in the fact that the company is acting against the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer then gets a special price (and another) offer.
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators are similar to the sale.
"If the cases you are talking about occur, this could be a violation of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in termination of cooperation with the company concerned," replied Martin Kemrová.
However, it is unlikely that similar activities with regard to responsible mobile operators would not be brought.
In particular, in the case of three mentioned companies, there may be thousands of customers.
This is not the case with any of the operators.
These companies have insignificant profits and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Possible problems point to Miroslav Čepický: "The law of similar speculation allows, however, the services of these companies use only a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not kept in their name, so they cannot have full access to it as common customers of mobile operators."
But that should be a little weird for the CTU.
In addition, another question is being opened for the UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a similar procedure, why do they block the emergence of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has a relatively strong power to discover similar activities and, if it does not want to, may not be satisfied with the explanation of operators that they have no idea of anything like this and their business conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the dearest
As has been seen several times in the text, the entry of virtual mobile operators has produced a significant fall in prices for services.
However, practically in all the countries where virtual operators were formed, classical operators tried to defend them more or less.
Jimi used arguments were virtually identical - too small, possibly too talented market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, those moments have been affected by regulatory authorities that defend not only the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Whether formal measures or informal pressures were created by the first virtual operator, and another one was packed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are taking the whole case down like hot potatoes.
We can't get rid of our experience in the impression that incompetence in these cases, they are more than appropriate.
But let's not put a pint in the gut.
If the dental information is correct and the virtual operator really appears here soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If any of the operators admitted the creation of any virtual mobile operator, it is only difficult to remain unattractive to reject other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling the rails than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four performances of the new version of Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, on the occasion of the Czech State Day, celebrated the new recordings of the state anthem Where my home is.
Hymn has now recorded the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohláv.
There are four versions - with male or female solo vocals, presentation and instrumental versions.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka took part in singing.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krkek.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
The Belarusian considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymen.
The Czech radio said earlier that he deliberately chose to sing solo variants of singers with young representative voices which are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I have worked with both, and then also with the congregation, to make sure that they have a clear dike, so that the text should be understood well, that they should behave," he said.
The Czech State Anthem next year celebrates the 175th anniversary.
Song Where my home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of the Stavovské Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlovačka Josef Kajetán Tyla supplemented by the music of František Škrupa.
She gained popularity and people spontaneously took her away.
The first piece of song then became a natural part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What a "new" anthem
Prague Public Transport will take you to the chip for the first time on Wednesday
The Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written into the history of the Prague Transport Company as a date when the first passengers will enter the subway, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon instead of a paper ticket.
This one can get about a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Travellers can buy 30 days and 90 days and a year's coupon (one from 1 January 2009) and at the same time buy on their chip card in the infocentres and workplaces of the Transport Company at metro stations Museum, Můstek, Guide Holešovice, Angel, Roztylly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská garden, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday you can also buy coupons via the internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers in the afternoon.
Those who start using internet trade can definitely forget about the exit window at metro stations, where they had to stay regularly in long queues for paper tickets.
The Kupon buys it online, and on Opencard, they're going to record it in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"At these locations there is a passenger counter with trained service, which will help those interested in the online purchase and will also load a coupon on their card," said Martin Opatrný, spokesperson of the project.
In addition to the library, you will be able to upload electronic coupons on Opencard also in self-service machines, which are mounted in several underground lobbys.
What kind of machines do they look like?
They're red, they remind ticket labels, and the passengers may have noticed them at the metro stations Roztilo, Budějovice, I. P. Pavlovova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year they should be 80," Opatrny added.
Kupon will check the driver's seat for automatic
The service of the vending machines that start tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is put the Opencard chip card in them and the previously paid coupon will be recorded for it.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow apply not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
Thus, in the tourist trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which are driven to the capital mainly by the inhabitants of the Middle Ages.
"In the trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with card readers, through which they detect the time and frequency of coupons," explained Philip Drápal's ticket control from the Ropid organization, which sets up the timetables of Prague mass transport.
Town buses have card readers built in the ticket office at the driver's.
It is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to attach Opencard to the designated place on the side of the box.
The driver will check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Travellers who do not ride in the city buses and will not remember when the coupon ends, can go back to the self-service machines where coupons are recorded on the card.
They see information on the validity of their documents on the display of the device.
Sudety wanted a US referendum
In 1945 the Sudet Germans requested the integration of Šumava to the United States.
It's coming from a letter stored in the collection of South Bohemia's scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under at least the United States of America's patronship.
With such a wish, apparently, some groups of Sudet Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This comes out, among other things, from a letter that was kept in one private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov are asking in the letter of the U.S. President not to allow the return of the "Sumava Juppa" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be really sure that American units come in German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as freers," says the letter signed 'People who lie in the heart of Shumava.'
Because the connection to Czechoslovakia gives allegedly the Sudetian Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national nature - only the hope of brutality, carelessness, confusion, oppression and slavery, asks the authors of the letter of the U.S. President to take over the Protectorate for present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of the fourth million inhabitants, you would grant this territory to a foreign country that oppresses and turns minorities and nothing, nobody has contributed to the victory of the Allies," says the letter.
The reason the authors cannot sign is allegedly a fear of the revenge of the 'Czech oppressors'.
If the President of the United States allegedly doubted the thinking of the Shumava Germans, it would be enough to arrange a referendum on whether or not its inhabitants want to become part of the United States or live under the patronship of the United States.
Although the text of the letter can sound a little naive in today's knowledge of postwar history, according to some memorials, the expectations of the August Germans are right.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least imagine that this would be their withdrawal from the Republic, few of them had allowed themselves to do so at all.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate a certain kind of autonomy with Sudets.
Others believed they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was in the war as a Buddhist German set up for the Navy in Balta.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holštynsk, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, they would be welcome," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, did expect him to be removed from the republic by means of Benedict's decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
The Emo campaign will attack the driver
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Still, it would be possible to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport is about to launch at the center.
The Minister Aleš Řebíček's office promises to discourage the driver from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million will appear on TV, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on the flyers.
She should advise the driver from driving fast and drunk behind the wheel.
And remind them also, before they go, that they should be brought in.
He wants to make contact with young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what happens in the sweat?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And that's what "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign says:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "do not think" is written in capital letters on the espézce.
And in the pool of blood, then the word "pays."
It's supposed to symbolize that in a moment of care, you can pay yourself with your own life.
The viewers will be scared by the spots until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the English countries, where pictures with drastic pictures of accident victims can commonly be seen.
He promises to reduce the accident and the number of dead people on the Czech roads.
Spots have been prepared by the EuroSCG agency.
Sugar and running on the driver
"The driver pays for the sugar and whip system.
Sugar for them is that, for example, when they go to red, they save time.
The storm is the threat of fines or accidents.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist at Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why I need information campaigns in the press and mostly negative ads, my psychologist.
They are already less effective, according to him, tables that alert drivers to danger.
"If a static table is installed warning against danger, it will probably soon merge with the surrounding area and the driver will not be able to pay attention to it," Kořán pointed out.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territory in exchange for peace
The President of the Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke to him for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. the Prejordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He did that in an interview that was printed on Monday by Jediot Achronot's diary.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will have to return almost all (occupied) territory if not all," Olmert told the daily daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (the land of Israel) because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and in particular does not want tractors or bulldozers run over his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends will have to give up part of Jerusalem," observed Olmert in an insult to two July attacks in a city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find the "special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historic places" that lie within the Old Town.
"He who wants to keep Israel's sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed further.
Out of the Golan Heights
The Olmert also spoke for the departure of Israel from the Golan Heights, which, according to him, is an inseparable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require certain efforts from Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria only by leaving Golan," he pointed out.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to surrender to get Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relation to the (Shitian movement) Hizbollah; they will have to give up the continued support provided by terrorism (Shitian Movement) Hamas, Al-Qaida and Jihad (Sweden War) in Iraq," he specified the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: Are the stevardi on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them.
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether the stevardi and the passengers for the rides can be on the bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally adhere to the law, the operation of the stvarda is contrary to the road traffic law," says the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a 22 - year - old steak last week apparently caused the truck driver to cross the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl sat next to the driver at the least safe spot in the car, although she had two more seats reserved.
The bus may, however, crash or start sounding sharply, even when the stevard carries out coffee or newspaper.
The role plays whether the bus is equipped with standing spots according to the technical licence.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
Remote buses Students Agency do not have seats for standing; which is currently confirmed by the director of Radim Jancura.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
Listening to it, we have come to the fact that passengers can go to the bathroom when they have their seat," he said.
The stevarda law doesn't know
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of stevarda - no legislation solves this role.
However, no legislation even prohibits the transporter from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the vehicle guide; its rights and obligations do not define," says Hanzelka.
Deputy Head of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný points out that the law takes care of the issue sufficiently.
"It depends on whether a bus is allowed in the approval of the landing sites.
That's how it ends," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where places are placed on stands and maximum speeds, intercity with places for standing at higher permitted speeds and on a remote without standings at the highest allowed speeds and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on a plane, said the expert
Expert BESIP on the transport safety of Jaroslav Hořín on the movement of the stevards on board the bus does not see a major problem.
"In a smooth ride there is no danger, the situation can be compared to a plane service.
It is not even here sure when the turbulence comes and the flyer can hit the head."
"However, if the bus fails sharply, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like in a city bus or tram.
The safety of stevards must be dealt with by the carrier through internal rules," he says, and also thinks, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unsolved.
Jancura is willing to cancel the service
Student Agency offers stevard services as the only bus carrier.
He's employing two hundred of them.
Even after an accident, the Director does not consider their profession to be at risk.
"But once I realize they're being called at risk, I'll cancel them.
Coffee and newspaper can get passengers on arrival.
It would save costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the absence of stevards in their vehicles was justified by the Director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who operated a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
"We don't have stevards, we've been up against this since the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end with some fatal injury," he said before a whole year for Week.cz.
It's become a huge tragedy.
In the accident of a link connection to Naples, a young stevardka from Pilsen died, who worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck probably disappeared without using the routeway from the stopped lane and blocked the bus.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he was infected by the right front part.
That two seats reserved for the rest of the stevard would be sold out, Jančura refuses.
"This location is not possible for remote connections to be booked, it is blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's eagle, but the financial compensation is expected by the culprit.
The amendment to the law?
I won't.
The specification of the movement of stvards on board a bus could bring an amendment to the law, on which a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport works for over a year.
"No concrete conclusion has come.
Buses don't even solve too much, rather point system, maximum speed on the highway and use of mobile driving," says Hořín expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the operation of the stevards to be anything that would seriously endanger passenger safety," says Mr. Hanzelek, saying that the bus security control is under the authority of police and labour security authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
Great words in the letter of the board of directors of WestLB are missing from the employees of this bank.
By bringing together the units of this düsseldorf monetary institution with the French Dec-Bank will be created "the central financial group institution savings for trading in capital markets," we will read in the letter that got to the public on Monday.
WestLB shall, according to the letter to this transaction, enter the 'competence' in order to ensure long-term revenues.
It is said that such a link may be the decisive impulse to further pool in the Landesbank sector.
Such texts arise when the board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in the problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Financial Services Federal Authority, whose communication from the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
The connection between Deka-Bank, which customers savings know for her investment funds, and WestLB, whatever the nature of it is, however, has been spoken for a long time - even on the French side.
Chef Deka-Bank Franz Waas, during the presentation of the mid-year management results at the end of August, heard that at the merger of his bank house from Mainzer Landstraße with one of the Land Banks, such as Helaba bank or WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, for which it stands from one half of the Land Bank and from the other, has entrusted the board with talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be capital market trades or part of them.
The talks have just begun, however, concern the financiers.
Deka-Bank, which is one of the more important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, does not speak for the first time in connection with the consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed like the merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba could take place.
In the end, nothing was ever out of this triple band.
Shortly after the merger plans came to the public, the Land Government of Hesen has spoken against Helaba’s participation.
Both other banking houses didn't connect like that.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz gained Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart instead.
Nevertheless, speculations about the Deka-Bank connection with Earth banks have repeatedly appeared.
In recent times, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, expressed speculation about the merger of his financial house with others.
It seems, however, that independent of this, the belief that the approximation of different banking houses in the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the Earth Snow in Bavaria, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg might be the first to compete.
That's not very good news for Helabu.
If the pressure on the next merger is increasing, it gradually loses possible partners for such a connection.
In the south, only the second violin would play despite the fact that the financial crisis is still facing much better than the banking homes in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the connection with WestLB banned the savings and gyric banks of Hessen-Thüringen, who had a share in Helaba forty-five percent.
This would appear to be Nord LB at most.
Geostrategic considerations of this kind are but only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how many business models of individual institutions work together.
In June Merl stated that the decisive question of which trade model should be ensured by the future competitiveness of the Landesbanks, the Federal Union’s savings and girical banks so far did not respond.
Everything could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, does not wish for anyone in this institution.
That is why, in the letter of the Board of Directors, it is also said that they are seeking a "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect to the individual components with the Deka-Bank, it will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Vicend with Italy"
For Elena, it's the first time for Luca to third or fourth.
But this time, Elena's gonna be like his girlfriend, and he says everything's gonna be different, says.
Behind them, on the five-litre barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a stronger beard and two hundred tourists on the Oktoberfest prove how deep the tones can release his throat.
Elena Luca's going to rain first, and then she's going to kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From now on, from bus parking next to Puorta Nuova Station, four buses will leave this evening at 23.45 with the name "destinazione Monaco, festa della bierra", expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses are mostly owned by Italians, only Brazilians ride one bus.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing with their flag, celebrating at night.
And out loud, he says Marco Guard, it's nothing for Italy.
Marcovi, wearing a long coat with a lining made of leather and glasses with wide silver rings, the three buses belong.
He's been with them for five years on Oktoberfest, only this year holding three expeditions.
In the night, between the beers with the beer, at 22.30, leaving back.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs EUR 75, including a welcome beer toast by Kaiser, cooked exactly by the Bavarian Act on the purity of beer, health insurance and German speaking guide - Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
Buses go up to the night, after the autostrod to "Brennero".
Beer is not served, not yet.
The bus is closing fast, the passengers are sleeping.
They do well, they'll need their powers.
It is set up in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where you take one more break in front of Munich and many other buses with an Italian license plate on the freeway.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresa in the middle of the 7th morning, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are getting along, Marco's last speech explains the plan of the attack.
One: Put on a yellow hat.
It is written on the left by "OKtoberfest", next to Marco's Internet address, travel agencies: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors open to the beer tent, run!" calls Marco into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and place your seats in the back of the tent.
"Don't go ahead, don't move, not all yellow hats on the same bench, move into space!"
Maz is worth 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Serics, show us how well we behave.
Once you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third, "This evening exactly at midnight be back here!" Do you understand?
And up on Wiesn, a space with pyjay tents.
On the way, one member of the group hangs yellow hats as marks on trees, signs and even on the election poster of one large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
As a "Vicend with Italy" is known for the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
The exact figures of visitors are not available; they are talking about fifty thousand people who are travelling across the Alps and fall into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors this weekend are said to have arrived from Italy.
A number of Munich police will strengthen seven police officers from southern Tirol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, leading national statistics in which the Italians in front of Britain (about 60 interventions) and Rakušany (approx. 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments occupy the first place.
Especially popular is the state of Hofbräu in Italy.
Sleepless Nights for Believers Hypo Real Estate
Last week, the Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is a good thing that this policy used the word "scientific" and also the fact that the German banking sector will not remain critically spared.
For the one that happened last weekend.
In index Dax followed by a financial house specialising in the financing of Hypo Real Estate (HRE) property will receive a loan of several billion to protect against turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation on Monday said to Agent Reuters that this loan would go up to EUR 35 billion.
Interests will have to pay the Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only for the actual amounts exhausted.
They say the money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background, the losses of Depfa’s subsidiaries are.
According to the news report on long-term projects for which money has been loaned, this state-owned financier has extremely short-term refinancing, which is no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve was shut down by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and the share of equity from 1.6 to 1.45 percent slightly decreased.
Current revenues and net revenues from financial transactions decreased to zero last year, proceeds from increased value of claims and from certain securities, as well as from the abolition of the provisions for credit trading decreased by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher returns for the subsequent settlement costs in restructuring the former Depfa Group and the reimbursement of interest under the tax Regulation and for the brokering of the trade for the group companies, the 16th percent decline on the income side was still moderated.
The former state-owned financier, after his privatisation in 1990, burned on mortgages for trade workers which were then cut out of the portfolio of services and led by Aareal Bank.
As too little were made in traditional state funding, Depfa was involved more strongly in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private investors and states (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and varied internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate has to write off something, and these depreciations will have a "essential material effect" on the calculation of profit and loss of the entire group, as some have been tirelessly heard.
The fact is, there won't be a dividend.
She's been reduced by two-thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been an important financial asset for state and infrastructure projects since Depfa took over.
Stronger than other institutions depends on the refinancing of the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans was practically dry because the banks are keeping their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a year for part of Depfa’s credit portfolio – around EUR 50 billion - short-term refinancing funds.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the financial need for the group is covered by this loan over a reasonable period of time, and the company is protected "before the influence of international money markets at present to a considerable extent of incapacity".
Other sources have been heard that, thanks to these money, refinancing is ensured by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use cash markets in due course.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Institute (BaFin) expect that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now ensured.
That's what shareholders and bank creditors hope for.
But with regard to the dynamics and inability of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan would not need to be completely exhausted.
However, it cannot be ruled out or otherwise.
After the bank stood late on Sunday afternoon, apparently, before insolence, it cannot, though preliminary, be saved by passion.
The share rate fell by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the contrary, the bonds were well held.
While priority debts have not moved virtually, they are losing secondary bonds rates much more.
This is primarily due to the bonds of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo and logically due to maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate Bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but stability is needed after a significant tightening of the banking crisis and an institution that brought it into the company by taking Depfa, to understand depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to calculate the repayment of securities within their due date.
However, what almost no one dares to hope can also happen in the next 15 months will be overcome by the financial crisis.
However, given the reports coming at the same time as this partial destabilization, there is no doubt that the right hope has now happened.
This particularly long-term creditors will probably prepare a number of long-term nights to decide whether to give up their obligations.
At least, investors may use the limit line to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to exchange rate yields later on years for the purpose of future payments of capital tax.
Silvana and secret box bento
When Sylvan Hiltrop is to be introduced the first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls begin to sneeze: the Germans are completely "cawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows that word from mang, and he's talking about Japan on his new exchange of residence blog.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've been driven out of school.
I live on Toki's side towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train in Tachibana.
I had to find my own way, but luckily, I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not as strict as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before nine starts a short sitting with a teacher called 'home room'.
But before teaching started, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk to people at all, let alone 40 students.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I'm wearing an old dress with my host mom, the blouse, the blue underclaps and the black leather shoes.
So I stood up before the bench and tried to make the correct statement: 'Sajónara Woo She Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany, and it's my birthday in a week.
At that point, I was very happy to learn a language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the classroom were fucking, chichatalo and raccoon, and I kept hearing the word 'kawai'.
I've known that from my mang.
It is part of the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'measurable, sweet'.
Then I quickly walked into my place.
A girl next to me smiled a lot, considered herself an honor to be a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the clock was quite calm, but when the gong called, they literally caught me.
They spoke over each other and they were giggling and asked me about possible even impossible - and yet it is really hard to understand Japanese.
At the break, they all packed up their bets.
My host mom made me a lunchbox, too, and that's something else than boring German snacks.
I had herbs rice, little sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some fish in tofu gum.
I don't know exactly what I eat in Japan most of the time.
These things look strange and taste pretty fresh.
I'm sure everything's really good.
Well, except for the salt of loaded plums, bro!
Benta's not just lunch at Japanese school.
Sometimes it happens that a girl will give his own bento, which in this case is particularly fashioned art, and hopes that the boy will get closer to know about the break during his lunch.
I read about that in my comic books manga.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
'Cause he's just fascinating me.'
After all, I've been wanting to read a manga for years.
And to understand these comic books and their culture better, I started learning Japanese once.
So I was absolutely clear that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And they're high-priced here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Even rats feel
If rats or covens run from danger, does that mean that they also feel fear?
Neurolog Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals even have feelings.
But how could it be checked whether they feel the same way when they act like we do?
The online magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions from famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in his series presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else so far being able to prove if we cannot prove that consciousness has other people.
But in this case we can at least hope because all human brains have a suitable basic configuration.
However, as soon as we start paying attention to another species and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter an inconvenient terrain because hardware does not match.
When a rat gets into danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People act alike, some scientists think of comparable subjective experiences.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of brain structures make it difficult to transfer our subjective survival to animal consumption.
However, it is because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the side prefrontal cortex (due to its share of short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area is much more developed in humans than in other primates, and it seems that other creatures are missing completely.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to believe that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could hide the language nature of man: because so much of his perception is connected to the tongue, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if the knowledge of the tongue didn't matter, he would certainly have influenced the tongue, so that animal consciousness, whatever it was constructed, probably differed from most states of consciousness.
That's why it's hard to find out what it looks like to be conscious of other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it does not measure itself either, because of a particular hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, it puts us through his research before major problems.
Most of my inventions refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically accessible.
Animal awareness processes could be explored regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, in particular an example of visualization.
But this approach by Christof Koch and Francis Crick focuss rather on neural correlats of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical, but they may not be either.
It is interesting that this approach also highlights the importance of non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does this result in feelings?
I take them out of the fact that an emotional system like a fear system is activated in the brain aware of its own activities.
What we refer to as "a fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of a defense system located in the brain (or its consequences such as physical reactions) will be used by operational memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely linked to those areas of cortex that are called primates, and especially people.
In connection with language nature there is a fine separation of perception, because with words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states, so that we can assign them to others alongside ourselves.
In contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio considers that feelings are derived from more primitive activities in the areas of cortex and brain stem dedicated to physical sensations, like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, concentrates more on the brain strain.
Because this network has not changed too much during human evolution, it could easily participate in feelings perceived by more animal families.
I can't deny it very theoretically, but I find it inconclusive.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us in rats and people seems to be afraid, probably feel both organisms the same way: How, however, can Pankseep say, whether rats and people feel the same way when they act like this?
Is the cord fleeing from danger, and does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, only the similarity of behavior cannot prove the conformity of survival.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us on: rats and people have similar brain stems, on the other hand, a raccoon or brain.
But he's responsible for the feelings of the brain stem?
And even if it was possible to prove it to man: how would we do that in a rat?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even sage (who knows?) have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness lies on special circuits and on tongue), I prefer to examine emotional behavior rather than the emotional perception of rats.
However, in this case, we can look forward to progress on a neural level if we measure the same level in rats and in humans.
Like the rat, I don't examine my tongue and my consciousness, I don't even know how to feel, but I don't know if they exist.
It is possible to consider it short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward than to take my hands against the walls over again.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of UEFA Platini: Grace for Poland and Ukraine
Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that preparations will soon be managed directly by the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise ME together with Poland," said Vasjunyk.
"But it's not amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
In early implementation of the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are speculating.
It is even possible that the number of ME stadiums will fall from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said Grigorij Surkis, Chairman of the Ukrainian Union.
"EUFA will keep following us."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
The management of the Polish PZPN was revoked and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee.
At the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecki, the Committee met.
They say there is "a serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki, Polish Press Agency.
"The President of UEFA Michel Platini assured us by letter that he would not suffer this step from preparations for ME 2012.
Several teams from the first league were sentenced to a forced retreat in the last season due to manipulation, eventually had to move the start of the league quickly.
The angry Dennis Quaid returns the blow
She wanted to do an ad for a new movie, talked about private things in conversation, and now she's having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her ex- Dennis Quaid as a vermin.
He's furious and he's back on strike.
The late war roses in the former marriage couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaida: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors have had a bad deal - before the public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview for the American magazine InStyle last week, expressed the first time of her marriage: "Dennis had been unfaithful for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she knew about the extent of fraud after divorce.
Consider this mental striptease being PR's work for her new movie "The Women" - that tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaida's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was significant: "He's crazy," said the 44-year-old actor of the New York Daily News, "Meg repeatedly chews the history of our relationship and adjusts it".

Flights as well as hotels decrease
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one current study, they were even cheaper by 50 percent.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have again improved - this is the result of a study by travel providers and financial services American Express.
The company analysed its data on the first half of 2008 reservations and after the price increase in the first quarter, it found a significant decrease in the second quartula.
After prices in the hotel market have grown for several years, accommodation in many places has already been reduced.
Between January and March, prices increased in 41 out of 48 European cities followed by 6.9% on average compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most important was this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
The reason for this trend is considered by American Express to be a weak dollar exchange that caused the "lighting taste of American tourists to travel".
The decrease in hotel prices was also more heavily affected by financial centres than industrial centres such as Hannover, Kolín nad Rýn or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, prices of hotels increased by 26.3 percent even recorded a European record.
In the first quarter, flight prices also showed an increased trend:
Because of the kerrosine recovery, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, up to 29.2 percent for fuel-intensive long-distance flights.
From April to June, the fares in the Economy class decreased by an average 12.5 percent compared to the previous quartula, Business and First-Class classes, however, the changes in knowledge were less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, 11.9 percent grew, the second quartula decreased by 23.6 percent.
In German national years, according to the quoteed study, prices decreased by half even.
One reason for this price drop is the slowing economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an agreement between Open Skies, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased competitive pressure.
The sign of the tense situation is the disruption of non-profit lines by air carriers as well as the high number of airlines that launched the competition in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
With one goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV gets to the forehead of the table.
Luhukay is still unable to build a working 11th in Borussia.
He wrote Kristoffer Klein - to enlarge Unsolicited Landing for Representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach has become involved in the game up to late and failed to push out the balloon on the bar.
His report was thoroughly formalized and heard from his mouth convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
It didn't happen much in the catacombs, the break between the half-times ended, and most people sat back in their seats.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapist for almost three decades and has more respect than many temporary actors.
Thus his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Coach's assistant Cornelius Jol came by and picked up a finger on a match sign.
Cornelius is the brother of chief coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His command sounded like this: I am with the other goal!
The execution didn't happen.
"It didn't look good here today," said Marcelll Jansen later.
And the Bastian Reinhardt would've been a more relaxed wish.
For 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgians thanking the head of Mladen Petriće (11.) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbachians could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV celebrates 121 years of its existence this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena and a live updated table on the video wall, in which their team was presented as a premiere.
It'll be birthdays without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
It seems that the ongoing table result symbolizes rather the inconsistencies of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with late arrival of new players - Brazil Neves and Silvy, the goalkeeper Petriće even from FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly located, but can't crack yet.
"We need more emotion and more dribling," Jol said.
After defeat in the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
First report on the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to drop by 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss within one day in his history.
Later, Dow gained something.
Around 20.30, this most important world exchange barometer showed a 5 percent drop to 10 579 units.
Nasdaq's technological storm was with more than seven percent minus 1548 points.
The worst part was in Dow at this moment the American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and the Bank of America lost about 12 percent.

Goldman Sachs' stock lost almost ten percent.
A few days ago, the Grand Investor Warren Buffett had a share in this company.
In the framework of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage paper.
However, the total amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the State is to receive a share option list of financial companies that could be paid in favour of the exchange rate, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock courses in Europe fall
Billiard aid to banks in Europe and the US does not prevent any doubt from being given to investors.

Dark matter affects air space probes
For years scientists have no advice with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swinging-by maneuver.
Experts are afraid that the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity might not have been quite right.
Almost 18 years ago, the universe's "Ulysses" space probe flew through.
The blame of fuel lines, which will soon freeze, is now threatening to die in winter.
One mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion between scientists for years - anomalies of gravity washing.
The gravity washing machine is an air maneuver of space probes, which generates additional momentum in the gravity field of some cosmic body, such as the Earth.
The probes can save a lot of fuel.
European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what scientists have been describing for years in this case in wonder: flying bodies do not remain 100% as expected by a man according to good gravity law.
On the contrary, there is a lack of transparency at speed.
The probes unexpectedly accelerate or slow down.
So far, the physicists have failed to explain this effect.
He was baptized by an anomaly of gravity.
Several experts are concerned that perhaps even the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of mass by curvature of space, does not have to be completely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not wrong, and trying to explain the anomaly of gravity washing using the so-called dark matter whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"Responsible for this anomaly could be a dark matter that could also be found very close to the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only been aware of the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously a gravity force whose effect on another space body can be observed.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, which means that it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, even visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, 5th of the total mass of the universe is good from this dark matter.
In Egypt the kidnapping tourists are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt, tourists are kidnapped again at large.
The kidnappings from Sudan called for the ransom amounting to several million euros.
He said six kidnappers were killed in a gunfight before the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
I hear the ransom negotiations are already running.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
Europe’s tourists taking to Sahara seem to be free.
It was reported by the Egyptian state television station, Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to the news of the Italian television station Sky TG 24, confirmed: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages were released.
We are currently verifying their medical condition," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian State Television report, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides are fine and safe.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert seem to be on their way to Cairo.
The unclear remains the background of the shooting before the release of the hostages: according to the Egyptian security worker, the kidnappers were prepared to stop the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the ransom worker," said the quoted worker.
She said "it was only about taking the hostages," when she suddenly lost "this surprise".
On Sunday, Sudan’s soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six kidnappers and took two of them.
The kidnappings asked Germany to buy EUR 6 million; the money was to be handed over by a German wife from one of the hostages.
The journal "El Masri El Jom" with reference to one of the German intermediaries stated that the release of the hostages was being dismissed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release hostage female gender after paying the ransom.
Men should have been held until the kidnappers had had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
Abuse by "suicide led" opening
Multiple abuses led a woman to kill herself, to appear before the court.
After confessing to the eight cases of sexual harassment, Michael Treris, of Stithians, was sentenced to six years in Cornwall.
The court in Truro heard that Stephanie Randle's stepdaughter was regularly involved when she was five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," wrote Trevis in confession.
In the court, it was also said that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home at Mutley, Plymouth, 1 April 2007, 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trevris tied her up and tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Treris and his wife divorced in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But before the court, it was said that Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, followed the example of abuse that had been committed twice a week on her.
Ramsey Quaife, in court, said that in 2006, the friends of Miss Randle, who was also very devoted to surfing and cycling, said that she was "morally dead" and that "she gave up life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
They think she suffocated her plastic bag.
Randle stood in the face of his stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I bound her and bound her eyes.
"I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been awful for your victim to do it for only seven years.
"This awkward story ends with the victim taking his life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn't done that, the case probably wouldn't have gotten to the trial at all."
"In particular, I would like to emphasise the consequences your crime against their daughter for these years," he said.
"Evidently she'd probably be a promising, successful, happy young woman."
The officer who lost his data will be charged
The BBC has learned that the government official, who left top secret documents on the train in June, will be charged under the law on state secrets.
The man concerned left two top secret documents on the train to Waterloo at the time he was provisionally assigned to the Ministry of Defense.
The documents came into the BBC's hands before they were handed over to the police.
It's at least a major move against that law, and nothing suggests a criminal intention.
The BBC writeer for defense affairs Frank Gardner said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the Ministry and the Government Office," he said.
A staff member who cannot be appointed shall be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police Officer sue on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee (Joint Intelligence Committee).
The documents he forgot contained a secret analysis of Al-Qaeda and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown place.
Debt liabilities face B&B debt
British cooperative companies may have to deal with more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government provided 2,6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley £14 billion to protect deposits.
The interest of this loan will be paid to all companies that receive client deposits, including 59 cooperative deposits.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of cooperatives (BSA) said he was "harmful", that he and their members had to pay.
Fourteen milliliards' debt will eventually be paid by saved Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest that has been incurred in the meantime will be paid every year by all 700 financial firms that receive client deposits.
The Fund The monetary service plan for the BBC has confirmed that all 59 cooperatives are included in this issue.
It is humiliating that these institutions, which have been carefully treated... must now pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so prudent
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company was to pay proportionally to the deposits it held and that, of course, they were supposed to pay about 18 % of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on debt will increase to GBP 450 million in 2009.
That means that the delinquents will have to find £81 million to pay interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the cooperative association, said the BBC that it is convinced that this is not fair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions, which have been carefully treated during the realm of the housing market, must now pay back some of the accounts of those institutions which have not been so prudent."
According to BSA, no convulsions since 1945, when they appeared, did not fall.
"We will have to explore all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see how possible to protect cooperative companies and their members from a bill that could be substantial," he added.
The interest paid in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September until the end of March.
In 2010, the interest will be paid for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
Given that cooperatives are non-profit-making shareholders, this account will ultimately pay their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
The milk will be raised by fivepence per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey’s dairy company announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by fivepence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-inch betrayal in February, and comes after the research carried out by the advisory company.
Retailers are to decide themselves if they want to reflect cheating at customer prices.
Before February, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002.
The bail for Bangladesh’s exhibition refused
The Bangladesh court rejected the request of former Prime Minister Šajch Hasín Vadzid to release bail, which means that if he returns to his country, he may be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the charge that she received from a certain businessman over 50 million such as $729 700 when she was a prime minister.
The case is one of several charges of corruption that are raised against it.
Zijá's chalice, the long-term political rival Shaych Hasín, was released earlier this month on bail.
Šajch Hasín is due to return to Bangladesh for the next few weeks, but her party, Lidové liga (Awami League), asked the local army to give her full freedom first.
The writers say that while she was released for an honest word in order to have a medical procedure abroad, it is not, under the conditions of her release, clear whether she will remain free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she now appeals to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request from Shaych Hasina for bail, saying that it does not need bail when abroad is already under examination released for an honest declaration," said Rafique-ul Huq her lawyer.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers claimed that she needed bail to come back from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Sajch Hasín is to return home after 17 October.
She was detained last year after the army held by the provisional government took over power, but she was released from prison in June to be abroad for medical procedure.
Shijch Hasín and Chálida Zijá both reject each other's accusations.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in recent defensive vaccination for Taliban violence.
The UN carried out vaccinations last week at six provinces.
However, he says that for safety reasons she couldn't get to the children in the south of Helmand and Kandahar.
The UN spokesperson said that this happened despite the promises of the Taliban, that there would be no attack or defense of thousands of vaccination workers at work.
BSkyB lost a lawsuit on ITV
BSkyB lost the court’s review of the Commission’s competition decision, which led the company to reduce its share in the competition broadcasting company ITV.
BSkyB’s competition procedure directed BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5 %.
The Commission had previously stated that the BSkyB’s share had a competitive struggle and had given companies an unintended influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought a stake in 2006 in a trade that prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, ITV to buy.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of BSkyB’s shares in ITV caused doubts about ITV’s independence and invited the Commission to compete with the investigation.
The head of the consortia of Virginia Sir Richard Branson, consumer organizations and regulators of Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a disparity solution - above all because BSkyB had previously said that she was willing to give up her voting rights.
New investigation of the affair of U.S. attorneys
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
Tah came in a situation where the report on the affair drawn up by the Head Inspector of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized the White House officials, the legislator and former Minister of Justice Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was encouraged by the concerns that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Danney will now investigate whether officials interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators in order to have justice.
General Inspector Glenn Fine stated in the report: "A serious accusation including potential crime has not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special plaintiff with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of its key recommendations.
Spor started when the U.S. Ministry of Justice deprived nine U.S. attorneys in December 2006 of their duties.
That's when the ministry said the lawyers were released for poor performance.
However, later on, it turned out that the release of lawyers was not much worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the redundancies were motivated politically.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of high-level Republican Members and Senators, others refused to investigate accusations against Democrats.
American lawyers are investigating and running lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
The head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, finally resigned because of the release.
The numerous other representatives of the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
The report by the inspector General spoke very critically to Gonzalese's role in the affair, saying that he was carrying "main responsibility" for redundancies that he "abdicationed" from his leading position and in the event of "excessably not engaging".
Other officials, including former High Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's great will be appreciated
Rock star Meat Loaf gets one of the Q Awards for his epic hymn Bat Out Of Hell.
A singer who comes to London for his special gold prize next weekend said he was "respected" with recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title composition of the Meat Loaf album from 1977.
This year's Nomination takes place in four categories, Coldplay.
Paul Rees, chief editor of Q Magazine, said, "There are some songs that stand over things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed large vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
She started an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and most recently reached the 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell held on the ladder for about nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - the real name of Marvin Lee Aday - suffered health problems in recent years, was also performed in 2003 due to irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on the stage.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel his concerts.
Later, it turned out he had a cyst on his vocals.
Occasionally, often forgotten and maybe soon for sale
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roadways, some famous, others only useful.
But even many cabbies-veterans and long-term locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This little alley is in the East Village district and leads north from the First Street without getting to the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
In the width of about ten meters and lengths of 40 meters, it is more like a dusty passage than a transport haul.
There are no signs of street names.
It's practically invisible in the normal atlas.
Yet, he has an alley of admiration.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants Extra Place to retaliate and create cleaner passages to shops and boutiques to open in new buildings.
Other admirators are long-standing neighbors who say they were reduced by an alley of charm simply because it was one of the last remains of the time before the block was implored.
However, the City Bureau for Protection and Development of Construction, which has a street in its power, is not of any interest to hold on to it.
At the meeting of the Regional Committee, representatives of the City Office and Avalon Bay prepared a plan to buy a street developer.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of General Community 3, the Committee favours the option where the streets will remain in the hands of the city and asks for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very few lands, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
"There could be proposals for repair and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to retaliate a small street and settle seats, several of which would use a coffee shop, whose interest in renting the space of the developer was expected.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy a street was first published at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to repair this evil alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale suggested the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Office for the Conservation of Construction, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and said that the task of his office was to develop property rather than manage.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a small trace in history.
Some people think that the streets got their name in 1802, when the large farm of Philip Minthorn was divided between several of his children and on the other narrow stripes of the country no one was entitled.
To Extra Place led the back door of the CBGB, a punkrock monument that closed in 2006, and the alley is perhaps the best known as the background of the photo on the cover of the Ramones "Rocket to Russia".
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn up clothes, and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the use of East Village, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place and claiming that only a piece of public property, though concise, should the public remain.
Others consider Extra Place to be a rarity - almost unchanged part of a city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog named Jeremiah disappearing New York (with the subtitle of "The Book of Worships: bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of eviction"), posted a part of the story about Extra Place from the Rubric City, which appeared in the newspaper The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind alley, dark even in the day and bordered by rusty iron gates of warehouses and covered windows, where old newspapers are being driven through the streams of the week."
Except for a few exceptions, one last night's alley looked exactly the same.
The rat ran across the blind end of the street near the door, which once led to the CBGB, where today there is a shop with expensive clothes.
The walls were graffiti and next to the fresh dose of the dumped newspaper lay an empty bottle of beer.
A couple of passers said they didn't usually think about Extra Place, but it suggested that he could use some kind of riot.
On the other hand, Fields said that he thought that some people underestimate the impressiveness of the alley in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "was in the dark, wet and disgusting places."
Balling quality debate: immersion to English
In this edition, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the positions of candidate for biling education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic worker from California and the Director of Education in Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "More than you think: why a high school needs to be selected".
Effectively reach out to the Hispanic voters is a foolish matter.
Barack Obama's educational agenda just proves it.
Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-American and Hispanic students have significantly lower probability of graduates than white students," which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama advocates, inter alia, Obama's educational agenda, "survivor bilingual education" for those who are only learning English.
However, the question of Barack Obama remains whether his commitment to bilateral education, which puts emphasis on the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Consider Sixth Street Prep, a charter primary school in Los Angeles East.
The students of this school are in total most cases Hispanics from low income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only arrived recently, are still learning English.
Nevertheless, in state mathematics tests in 2008 it reached the highest level of incredible 100 percent of fourth grade pupils.
Almost the same ninety-three percent of fourth-class students reached the highest level in state tests from English language and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street highlights control and exercise, constant assessment of skills and access without excuses.
Next, and Obama should note this, according to Linda Mikels, director Sixth Street, teaching the school pedagogical approach for those who are only learning English, "full immersion".
immersion to English emphasises the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is against lingerie education, said to me, "We had great success with one completely new student from Mexico -- after 12 months, you'd go into class and not know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take school like Sixth Street Prep for a role model, what should other schools look like with large shares of Hispanic and English learning students?
The results reached by the school should be self-evident, but the educational agenda of its own party (National Education Association is a long-term advocate for dual education) and its own consistent support for dual education makes it unclear to Obama's prediction of his response.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, recently trivialized things when he said that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to delete performance differences, it should rather be about educational patterns that work, to think carefully before taunting and trivializing them.
Oil is dropping sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to the concerns that neither the US plan to save the financial markets would have to reinvigorate the economy.
The oil-term prices decreased by 7 percent in the morning trade in New York commodity stock exchange to 99.80 dollars per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than $20 for the barrel.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street as well as by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of 145,29 dollars for a barrel in July, this month’s price fell to almost $90 per barrel, while they jumped out on the wave of huge financial market uncertainty.
The credit has been reinstated by investors on Monday, even after the Congress Bureau announced that there was an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history on the weekend.
This report has been covered by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from the end.
In the latest episode of the gradual decomposition, the government announced that Citigroup would buy Wachovia Corporation’s bank section.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg Government has partly set up a European financial conglomerate of Fortis.
Barclays Capital's analysts said that the weekend negotiations that led to the plan to save the economy show that they are unable to restore the market's mood.
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"Events to global stock markets, interest rates and exchange rates have been strongly compromised," the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in their investor report.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is to what extent the American virus will spread to all over the world and especially China."
This bank's analysts reduced their expectations for next year, as oil consumption dropped by about 20% due to a slower growth in the economy and reduced their 2009 gas price forecasts.
The wild ride in the second quarter exceeded the team's record
After spending more than anyone in Jets's last eight seasons on the track, he thought he'd seen everything.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which Jets turned a pointless game in a sleepy ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizona Cardinals settled by their scratched game with the masculine clouds above them.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranue Coles to the twelve-yard touchdown sprint, which perfectly preceded the afternoon in which their gradually developing cooperation moved a mile ahead.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter after another two touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before half the match.
"It was nothing special," Favre said about all his matches to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
We've been having a great talk, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were guessing, defense was attacked by quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis intercepted a stray throw and returned it by 32 yards to touchdown.
That's Eric Smith's safety taping another pass and picking her up.
Linebucker David Bowens forced Warner to go to the fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, kick Jay Feely's 20-yard goal from the field, which got lead 34-0.
That's what Jets got in one quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was invited to describe this madness, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both of them - Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without reply - Mangini said: "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third one.
Too many points in the short section."
Restless Gebresses has improved his world record
Haile Gebreslessie of Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best remote runner at all when on Sunday on the Berlin Maratón he exceeded his own world record and became the first person to take 26.2 miles within two hours and four minutes.
The winner of the pleasant flat track at 2:03:59 p.m. overwhelmed his previous time 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - has exceeded the world record or is at least a champion of the world at all distances from the metro mile to the maraton.
Last month Gebreselassie left the Olympic maratón in Beijing, because he was afraid - from a reverse perspective perhaps too empty - that the contaminated air will crush his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sun and 48 degrees to start, 55 degrees in the finish - won on Sunday Gebreselassia with a lightningy diameter of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As the track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on the longer track, the Maratón record in the past decade fell by more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselas told journalists that he had cramps in a doll two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break clearly made him better than she stopped.
"I am so happy," said Gebreselas to reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
A week ago, I started over again, and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, the Eastern African rival Ethiopia - due to the fact that he was overly planning his races, generally avoiding the world's Maraton peaks, he relied on conductors, like it was a race on the track, and he built world records over the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running quality.
Maintained at a pace of four Kenyans reached Gebreselassie half of the time 1:02:04.
After the conductors fell off, Gebreselassie was driven by two elite Kenic runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little sooner than three miles before the goal of Gebreselas, he took the last time and escaped Kwambai, who then ran second place at 2:05:36 and improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi ended third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, the excellent year was the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19:19 Irina Mikitínková, a native of Kazakhstan, now a German citizen.
Record time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
The 46 - year - old Mikitěnková won the spring in London’s Maratón at 2:24:14 a.m.
Beijing's games left out because of something that was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and the third marathon that ever ran, improved its personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopians and Kenya run to the great head start and then took them after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Asale Tafa Magara from Ethiopia took second for 2:21:31 and Helena Kipopová from Kenya ended third at 2:25:01.
The pride and obstacles of black people's lives in a separate city
Located between the extensive amusement parks of Orlando, a few miles from all the shiny, loud and brown, a quiet city with pride and ambition of African American life lies.
Eatonville, the first completely black town that was incorporated into the state, and where Zora Neal Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as easy as she described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquets, three hundred brown hides, three hundred good swimmers, enough cowboys, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrim's place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Zora Festival! to lay down the clones of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city that she described remains aside, although she made it a stop for tourists by integrating it into the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
He is still so independent, dignified and private, as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows us so little that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year when the Black Presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion of races, many local residents remain cautious against foreign views.
"We pay great attention to how our story tells itself," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here since birth and is a member of the oldest parishes in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both the historical model of the Black Uprising and the community of nearly 2400 people, where the poverty rate is double than the national average.
He is a centre of literature, but also a shadowed oak example of Southern black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - created from American slavery.
It's not too surprising that the locals are both proud and protective.
And worry about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way to say Hurston here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through the heartful books full of screams like "Mules and Men (Muly and Men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (his eyes followed God)" (1937).
Five pauses of the Florida tourist guide changed the town a bit into the road no 17, which leads through the often mixed center of Florida, in the podium of black history and human drama.
With the success of a big drum in life and literature, Hurston led the reader to trade in Joe Clark's first eatonville mayor, and then turned to more separate places.
"On the left side of the road," she wrote, "is a white brownly decorated modern national school with well-maintained courts and a playground always old for Howard Miller, although she can't even read or write about."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "solds drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into an hourly hotel."
So in only a few hundred words Hurston Eatonville connected with the government, but also with illiteracy, renegade weddings and sex.
This obviously wasn't the typical publisher Fodore's.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it as it was," says Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls' congregation, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang complete songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
He still remembers Hurston as a C.O., who often came back after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that, most of all, when she joined the city, she arrived without announcements in the vast Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in the city, which is also proud of decent clothing today.
Most of the people were fascinated, told Franklin, but many were bitten.
"The people of Zera have always loved to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor, and her books were removed from the press.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, the current Langston Hughes, and the only black girl at Barnard College in the 1920s, was buried in an unmarked grave in the Florida Fort Pierce where she lived before.
There were no larger wake-ups or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I think that neither its meaning for the world nor its legacy was understood at all," said Valerie Boydová, writer of Hurston's CV "Wraped in Rainbows" published in 2003.
Change came in the '80s.
The district leaders of Orange County wanted to take the city through five yards of the highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-way road.
The stretching of Orlando has already penetrated the interstate highway No. 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming from a complex historical period.
The forced integration, along with other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950 ’ s, the battle for mixing hate races was brought to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"In fact, we had this lady who killed it.
They threw melon out of the car."
In the 1955 newspaper The Orlando Sentinel questioned the Hurston demand for forced integration and its decision in the Brown case against the education chamber, she said that it was "for my race insulting rather than celebrating."
The inhabitants now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the youth here.
"Black children were used to hugging - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Natiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and CEO of Preserve the Eatonville Community.
It took until the teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
"You don't include your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there is a cultural barrier," said Ms. Natiri.
Nevertheless, civil rights helped to create space for many more Zory Neal Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, have risen over prejudices with light-minded self-confidence and quotations such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker went to an unmarked grave of Hurston and began to fight for the recovery of her reputation.
Five years later, he came to the police in a bookstore called Hurston's bio by Robert E. Hemenway, who re-entered it into the American canoe.
The project arrived at the moment when the most famous daughter of Eatonville again found the light ramp.
The former Hurston neighbors now considered her a saviour.
To show what could happen to its highways, the community began planning Hurston's festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inauguration event two years later, and each January many return to the celebration.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"The five streams of the highway were rising, you would say that it would blow off, the real civil pride," Natiri said.
Boyd said it more simply, "It saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image of the city.
The out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began going to this church in 1993, began to appear in more numbers, and the residents began re-evaluating the past.
Eatonville joined the national historical register in 1998.
The new one-storey library (notably after Hurston) was opened in 2006 for the re-ashamed and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Only six miles from the centre of Orlando can sometimes act as a fallen alley in summer rain, as small as when it was based with only 27 Black families in the 1980s.
(Today is 90 percent black.)
With strangers who come to seek the story and meaning of Eatonville, it is still often treated cautiously.
Allowed for most interviews it is necessary to have in advance and certain things - as wall paintings in the oldest eatonville church, which painted white people and depicted black people in the fields - must not photograph.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a courageous, confident teacher who likes to live red, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be understood properly.
And as Hurston's festival expanded, domestic pride also increased.
Especially young people are pushing to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her whole race: beautiful, with problems and so, but not better, not worse and equally proud, creative, worky, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnics.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, honest love of the village sounds when he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police that he says would enjoy some help.
And even younger, such as 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonova, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just pass through here, they'll think, 'Hm, this town is nothing against the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look into history for a while, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we're all speaking fluently financially.
Nothing's changed at first sight.
If the tourists in Manhattan kept away from the news stands and the defensive television screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never decide that, in the glass beehive, the offices over their heads have bankers and investment fund managers who monopoliste New York, the worst "bad day in the office" every day since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still smothering metal carts along the sidewalks and handing over muffin bakers to the breakfast hall.
The Hispanics are still moving between the towers and wearing, like human mules, a fifty-gile shirt that hangs from the vahadel on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the street dining booths, and still not possible to get a yellow taxi on a daily day between 4:00 and 7:00.
It didn't look like a crisis at all until I, with all the pessimism talking, decided not to start a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I have timed this task to hide with the late afternoon seat on my local side of JP Morgan Chase, there were already about 20 people waiting in the queue.
Not in front of the cash window to collect or deposit cash, but before the counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists are asking questions about their way to trade with Macy's mixed goods and new customers are setting up accounts.
Most people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker" came for the same reason as me.
However, compared to me, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they arrived, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They selected money from so-called thrifts (a lot similar to construction savings), cash associations and those types of savings whose branches operate in only one state, which claim to take care of their customers as family.
15 such banks have gone silent in the past year.
A few days ago Washington Mutual, a bank with assets for $327 billion, went to the audition, and when New Yorkers came home for a weekend on Friday night, another bank tried, Wachov, with assets for $440 billion, a rescue buyer.
Employees of offices and shops who stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse, moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe port and which makes most of the saving on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned financially over the past week.
Some woman in my local Chinese supermarket talked to the phone and expressed herself to Lehman Borthers, the stolen bank, and to her exterminated executive executive friend Dick Fuld, with such familiality as if she was taunting a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, dressed about 50-year-old homemen of my worker, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my supply of food.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in money market funds.
I moved it, I won't take any chances."
Muslim graves destroyed after a Austrian right-wing fracture
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian right-hand side of the Free and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang took part in the manifesto, which was presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 by the organisation "Muses against Islamization".
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that display mosques crossed by a red line.
Police are accusing right-wing extremists of desecrating the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extremely right-wing parties achieved huge profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun near Liza were sometimes destroyed between Friday night's evening and this morning, and the police believe it was an organized event.
But detectives believe that it could have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred to Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether this incident has been linked to any of the choices.
A spokesperson of the Islamic communities said that they were "deeply shocked" reports of desecration that comes at the moment when the Muslim post moon of Ramadan is approaching the end.
In the meantime, Austria enters into a round looking for its own soul after the traffic went down in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both far-reaching right-wing parties, which had together more than 30 percent of the votes, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, led a vehemently counter-immigrant campaign and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the Free Party, who gained over 18 percent of the votes, protested against the six and burks in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to the food in which the relationship with Islam is perceived.
At his last meeting with the voters in Vienna, he spoke of a 'European Brotherhood' to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides seek to prohibit the construction of mosques and minerals and argue that these are the political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The research and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right on the position of the strongest political block in the country, suggest that this change was mainly caused by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter must not for a trip beyond the border
Gary Glitter, the glamrock star, who was convicted of sexual abuse by children, has forbidden the court to travel to France and Spain.
The officials have imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that it plans to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police were agreed last Thursday after she gave the officials evidence of Glitter's past judgments for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, his own name, Paul Gadd, did not attend a hearing with Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but he was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesperson of justice said, "On Thursday, 25 September, at Ashford's lowest court, the Austrian police asked for a regulation to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd didn't take part personally."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to travel to a foreign country, as recorded in the register of sexual attackers.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also transmit the planned date of departure to the police one week in advance.
If the obligation to inform the authorities was left behind, he could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible routes over the period.
The district spokesperson said: "The National Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to follow someone who stays in Britain because we have extensive systems that handle potential risks more efficiently.
Protecting Kent's people is the highest priority for the Kent police, and we are working carefully to track the behaviour of recorded sexual attackers so that we can reduce any danger to the public to the minimum."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to take his flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him pass the belt control and then he flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he arrived at the Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridg's lowest criminal court in West London and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully ordered him to register as a sexual attacker.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for the possession of child pornography.
The Home Office said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, is calm and pleased that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the true character, I take pictures of the master outside of the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls or costumes.
Only the essence of the great flamenca masters, separated from the focus on interpretation - I feel the relaxed expression of a man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
Second, human.
Inseparable, if we ignore privacy, in those moments far from the audience - then we can see a confidential gesture, a depth of an open view or a passionate gesture of hands that are carefree because they are not going to step on the stage.
German Günther Bauer is performing theatre performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with a less known face of masters.
With this purpose, the photographer builds a unique flamenca iconography from different environments.
The exhibition that takes place within the programme of the Moon photo flamenca (Mes de la Photographía Flamenca), " reflects the growing international significance of flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people, but if you look at photographs, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on the stage.
These people sketched "on the street" are capable of transferring passion, sadness, joy... and completely capture audiences.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
She wears her personality and character inside.
I wondered how to create a relaxed atmosphere that will allow me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenca.
In 1997 Bauer started a long way to portrait flamency singers, guitarists and dancers on board camera.
They are portraits which thanks to the choice of camera and materials resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the image and lends him the current spirit, which according to Bauer itself reflects both the flamenco: "The music with very traditional roots, which however does not cease to surprise and develop."
What breaks the audience is not the act of dancing, singing, or playing itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet the most important, with the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experience, it was and is constant work presented during these days in the El Fotómat gallery.
This selection of nearly 70 photographers creates famous figures of flamenca, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenca and will soon reach a book release that will contain exposed portraits.
The passion for portraitation brought Bauer to the idea of repeating "SportARTproject" two years ago.
Although their concept from "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "to take pictures of people, to recognize them and have the chance for a moment, whether longer or only short, to enter their lives - that's my passion.
I think in the photograph, portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or interact with people, personalities who sometimes don't even know, or give him just a few minutes to take photos.
Despite the same circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my imagination."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenca called "Flamenco-people" is displayed in the El Fotómata Gallery in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alamedou de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he writes was "faithful."
It is played in an environment that is not yet known, and tells about unknown events, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement her new project - she is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and travelled in Amazon.
The eternal favorite of Nobel Prizes for literature yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia, admitted that the project that is currently employing him is "a troupe" and that "all suggest that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had reason, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it, and I believe I will finish it once," he concluded his contribution to the exchange of ideas, ideas and words, which he saw in the city of aqueduct around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "Město and Dog" was one of the main figures of the third-year celebration of words and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickensov's "Our Mutual Friend" -, filled the theatre Juan Bravo into the last place.
With Félix Rome, who mentioned him, he had before him a dedicated audience, whose hour of time ran as water - a Peruvian with an amazing accuracy and a noteless amount of humor remembered how he wrote "discipline" from the original "contribution of a passionate reader" and from "power to live more than I have lived" a literary mission; as he added "a lack of inspiration" by writing "discipline", carefully concises and translates; or as his writings were influenced by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas, and what "remembrance images" are the basis for his stories.
Hispana-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to determine whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is merely fun, a quick experience" - stressed Vargas Llosa, saying that he believed that "on people he does" and "to try to break them out of line", and called on writers to "do not take the pride" and "take responsibility" of their mission.
For climateology, the festival in Pozoblanc is lost - there are no copies of
The exhibition with copies, which closed the Pozoblanc event, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement of the performers that the square surface was not in good condition.
Therefore, the company and Fermin Bohórquez, Pable Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández decided to cancel the bullfights.
The adverse meteorological conditions of this festival have been reduced in the long term, since two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, he prevented the rain from running second planned bullfights.
During these formations José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to build bulls in the arena at Castilblanc.
But that's how it was celebrated on Friday.
The winner became Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and a reward for a dynamic and endetically good performance was taken out on the shoulder.
On the same day of the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante changed two shots with a copy of greetings and one ear that brought him rather hidden seats in the arena than the Toreadorian art.
Even worse, El Julia, who passed the bull's arena of Los Llanos, was unsalted unmistakable.
In the second round, without a single breath, the majority of the audience earned a sharp criticism.
They took control in Álawa in a van with two thousand kilograms of hash
Ten minutes, five.
Ertzaintza in the city district of Armiñón (Álava).
The members stop two people driving in the van, and they give them food.
The charge, more than two tons of hash, is not stopped.
According to the Department of Interior of the Basque Government, they were persecuted and detained by one of the persons driving in the van, a man at the age of 38 who was identified as A. A. J.
Arrested was charged with drug smuggling and smuggling of state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road inspection at N-1 where they passed through the border of the city district of Armiñón.
They were going to stop the delivery for inspection, but the driver did not follow the instructions, speeded up and ran.
The car crews began to race immediately when the vehicle stopped at the side of the road a few kilometres away, at that moment both passengers jumped out and took off to the forestland.
Ertzaintzy’s members eventually caught up with one of them and confiscated 2,78 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects took over, as it appeared in the Iveco Daily delivery tour.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with parcels of hash which were subsequently transported to other police departments to detailed expertise and weighing drugs.
Furthermore, the police found that the license plate was "smotched" and disagreed with the information in the supply documents, and was therefore also detained from falsification of state documents.
Ertzaintza continues the search for a second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drugs.
Arrested A.A. J., 28 years old, he was transferred to a police department to set up appropriate formalities before he later joins the further investigation.
Heather Locklear actress arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Heather Lockler's actress, Amanda's favorite Melrose Place series, was picked up in Santa Barbara (Kalifornia) this weekend on a drug ride.
The Witness saw her doing unusual maneuvers when she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, told the magazine People spokesperson of California road patrols.
The Witness stated that around 16.30 p.m. Lockler's "wrecked on the gas, behind the noise of a storming driving forward and backwards and trying to get out of the parking spot - several times she ran over the sunglasses" during the smoking process.
The witness who apparently didn't first met the actress saw Locklear for a while after he stopped at the nearby highway and was coming out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the rescue service because "she was worried about Lockler's life".
When the police patrol arrived at the scene, she found an actress inside the vehicle that partially blocked the car.
"She looked disorientated", and therefore her inhabitants took her to a specialized drug and alcoholic center to undergo a test.
According to the police spokesperson, the actress cooperated and too much alcohol was excluded, yet "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was visible to the officers at first sight".
Locklear was detained for suspicions of proceedings under the influence of the effects of an undetermined substance and was taken into custody, although several hours later she was released for freedom.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from the medical clinic where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists on the Adalan Association of IU to exercise its powers in the bail of Silva
Today, Head of the IU and Member of the United Left of Gaspar Llamazares said that the final decision in the case of the former Mládá Councillor and the Sport City Hall in Seville Francisca Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being charged with negotiations in favour of his family, would depend on the regional association of the party.
"I am a powerful federalist, he is on the Andalus organization to exercise his authority," indicated Llamazares of the negotiations to which the party will have to proceed in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the head of IU insisted that, in the case of an investigation of illegal conduct that Silva had committed, "the transparency" is absolutely necessary: "The IU has always fought for such matters to be maximum transparent."
Similarly, he stressed that the party had a "direct ethical code for all public functions".
"Květ's Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), Garcia's epic bet
José Luis Garci in the film "The Flower Blood" (Sangre de mayo) inspired him by Episody from the national past Benita Pérez Galdós, revives the famous rebellion of the Spanish against the French - it is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the film creator "construct the expression of the character and analysis of society", which he always admired in his work of the famous novelist, explained today with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of the image before a large group of interpreters.
May's blood and merriers over two and a half hours will be put into cinema this Friday, and in the future a four-hour TV series for Telemadrid is set up.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Galdóse José Luis Garcia claims that the film was filled with the film by the film’s film’s film, for which Aguirre’s gratitude, which he was commissioned three years ago by the Autonomous Province of Madrid by filming on two-year anniversary of Madrid on 2 May, he accepted the offer that the story would be based on Episod’s national past.
The budget of 15 million, for which the Madrid province has completely contributed, means for Garcia's "unique opportunity" to create an environment with the scenes and costumes appropriate to the picture of the "Third Spain, which was wrong in the leader, for whom the fight for independence led to the country's bankruptcy and stamina," he said.
But the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support that came to the films of the Sad Wing (Ala Triste) or Goy's Enlighteners - almost double the Mayan blood - so he could not make some scenes from the script signed by Horace Valcárcel, with which he works almost all over his film track.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and empezar) works as commonly used - on the stage along with the actors who usually before making the rehearsals and who don't choose casting because it seems "student" to him and also thinks that "in the profession of the director is going to theatres and cinemas and so discover what is happening in the craft that he deals with".
Many actors who selected for May's blood appear in front of his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia's four nominations to Oskar, one of whom he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Flower Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Billiard and the last selected Blind Sunflowers, do not represent the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "that will only appear".
For this film, Garcia expects no awards.
"At first you think you're working for what's going to be after, but then you'll realize that you're only working for earnings, and so you're going to make one more movie," explains Garcia with more than 30 years of directorship.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of the Seville Dancer Tórtola Valencia
Sevilla Dancer flamenca gives away a tribute to another Seville Dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of the father of Catalana (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and when they were three years old, they moved with their family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on a oriental dance.
She lived a life full of passion, pioneering female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the corset that made women move freely.
This woman's life affected by the dance and aesthetic revolutions of interwar Europe, Isabel Bayón, has enchanted.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she suggested to me this character--it seemed incredible."
According to the dancer, "we are not talking about telling her life, it's about taking a soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of flamenca rhythms.
So, "the butterfly dance" evocated the guajiru or "the snake dance" some thong.
Her dance was meaningful and they told me that my dance of this aesthetics is also responding," she claims.
The presentation includes two exceptional personalities: Miguel Po lead, who will sing in one performance as well as in "Open Doors" (La Puerta abierta), and a teacher of Matilde Coral's dance, who made an exception and joined with her former frog.
"Matilde represents an older Tórtol, a mature figure.
I'm happy she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it's a great honor for me."
In the performance also counts with the music and guitars of Jesúse Torres and Paca Ariagy, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájara, viola Rafa El Viola and the co-workers of Juanfry Juárez, "who has the role of an eternal guide of this kind of artist, who are primadons with everything and who are always loved".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who took place at his time in such faraway places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who have a huge influence at some point in time, but no one knows her today and appreciates her creation even less," said Bayón.
The show starts today at the Lope de Vega Theatre at 8:30.
The book "Denary of the Fresh Woman" closes even triennials
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "New Woman's Denik" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez closed his marriage with Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalus government at the celebration of "Trienále Zenbie and Juan Ra Daemon" (2006-2008), organised to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the award of Nobel Prize for literature and the anniversary of their death.
"Zenbie and Juan Ra Daemon" are moving to the end with the new edition of this work, the international congress that will take place in New York City, the repair of Nobel Museum House and the Travel Show "Juan Ramon Jiménez: Onen ray of the Sun", which was opened in May this year, and after it passes around various Andalusia provinces, it should be planned to move to New York as planned at the time of the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusia Government also ordered eight hundred copies of the "New Woman" prepared by Pedrem Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Ences to continue to spread the awareness of the personality and works of one of the most world-renowned Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like him that much anymore
"Some god makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of the actress Sally Fields, who cooperated with him on "Without a bad intention" and under weight knowing that Newman had gone, revealing his unsatisfying vision of an abandoned American cinema and all over America.
Look how it took them to get Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And they knew he was pretty sick.
Even though he was for all the guys.
"Sometimes what one feels can't express in any way, and now I have lost a great friend," Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my country were better."
No one was afraid he'd be ridiculous or outnumbered.
The father of film and country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, when American self-esteem was at the bottom when desperately seeking reasons for pride.
When times are hard and people without virtue and only a handful of those who are worth your admire - there is no need to be Luis Cernud to love Paul Newman.
To all, he embodyed the almost platonic idea of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and won cases, from a drug addiction foundation based on honor of a firstborn son who died of overdose, to his own brand of home food and biofood.
Full treasure for the country, which has cost much effort to erode itself from suicidal eating culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, an Englishman, Daniel Craig, stated that one man died, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, the owner of Oscar for Sam Mendes's directs, said that working with Newman was without any doubt the peak of his career.
Bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, named Newman's trouple for his greatest source of inspiration.
"This fox has put on all of us a very high line," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few, who has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman, who is based on honesty and leading serious private life away from cameras these days.
It's not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for 50 years with Joanne Woodward, who has been faithful, although he has had more than enough opportunity not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I'm at my house?" I like to joke.
Let his pride in heaven hold him that on earth he rules harmony with his daughters and admirers - in America, it is not common.
It is said that "of all the great roles which he has embroiled, he was the best part of a dedicated husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a self - sacrifice philanthropist."
Immorts of the Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us yearn for the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the last year of 2012, maybe 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we're going to follow the race yesterday, I'm going to say no!
It talked about him as a perfect race, and according to my trial, he was the worst I've ever been on.
Such a bunch of nonsense that, if it were to be evaluated and I was tested, it would be obvious insufficient.
But let's see from the beginning, one at a time.
The nonsense begins to pick up a race number that makes you have to leave early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when you go there, let them give it everything (including the chip that is supposed to prevent crossovers).
Oh, no.
Here you had to first pick up a number (first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after sucking off the proper front) - what a surprise! - they only had a S-size shirt (second nonsense, because I need size XL).
Where are we living?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy only a little T-shirt because it's less of a substance and they're cheaper?
Well, these are small things, of course, compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Except that it had to go very soon for the chip and the front took over 15 minutes, he had to put his backpack back in there.
Over 35 minutes, the waiting time lasted, which is at a race where 11 000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as you could expect, the race started, and we haven't put our bags down yet, and when we did, it was much worse picking up.
In addition, the waiting extended by 40 minutes of rain, leading to a general riot and an attack on the cabin.
I believe 500 of us will have convulsions tomorrow and some like me will not display the right time to evaluate the results due to the chip they gave me and which, as I presume, did not correct the start time.
Of course, if anyone asked me about a perfect race, that wouldn't have occurred to me.
And so I think we're going to have to let the Olympic city feel good about it.
Microsoft is looking for receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction on the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to perform basic tasks as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft, a messenger that would move all over the company) and to notice what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptive" can determine how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It can also settle present according to conversion groups.
In a demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that he does not belong to a group that talks to her and that he is not an employee of a company.
She asks if she's going to see anyone, and she's telling her she's going to attend.
All this without a blue screen of death.
Stunning.
But, of course, that's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of Windows operating system.
This week's talk was very much about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer figured out that if computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial power, they'd be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as thunder when considering that Microsoft version from the version adds new functions to Windows and another "extra".
A change of direction would be an act of service.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing meaning, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who appealed to the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
He has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the mother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "dead" of the operating system not as absolute truth, but relative to the truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system and, on the other hand, more internet browser.
The computer turns on to launch Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around the windows.
What is half the applications that accompany the system used?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its online services and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They need it desperately, and here I have a little example.
I took this photograph in one room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the drink machine that asked them to use their search tools: "Your search.
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees were used to search Google's internet.
Last week, by the way, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
He's not coming at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count to 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone becomes more and more computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Azure Coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one of the halls in Edward Zwick's "Brought Diamond" as well as Al Pacino in "Kmotrov" Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the uniform of the muscle gay community.
And if we want to get into his life's roles, we can immer to the picture of a typical muscle with a pointy mustache that lifts the action in the festery circus.
It's basically nothing more than a typical cotton man's underpants, urgent and without sleeves.
The English spokesmen call him "dank," but the Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels is out of control over everyone else.
First of all, for his cruel name - although the people are called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as the legend tells, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, lovers of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above the other quality cotton, unisex with a cross-section, a distinguishing label, and a (almost insignificant) Belgian flag, which have models of the most embossive balls as a detail around the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company doesn't specialize on tank tops.
It also manufactures colleges hoodies, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, Navy shirts, baby suits, mini shorts...
Thought-out pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame to be just a bottom wash.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, who will be a father doesn't bother me."
A great image of her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though small figures, is a woman full of life.
They're taking Sister Cruz very seriously with their new act in fashion.
It means a lot more to Mónice than just some pretty, famous girls to borrow their name.
In Paris, Mango participated in the promotion event organised by Mango in its new seat, and the announcement of the most significant fashion prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
She's hearty and shy, and she'll get you close enough.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came here to introduce a new collection, which we proposed for Mango for this autumn season, and at the same time I attended the presentation of the second year "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner in Opera for honor of Valentina.
So it was a difficult day, but also an exciting day.
What is your new collection coming from for Mango, for whom are you already working the fourth season?
My sister and I love films from the '50s and '60s, and we have drawn many suggestions.
I also like to drive around town and watch women dress up, how they combine and grow their clothes, that's what I do very often.
You're a dancer, actress, designer, very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
Maybe I was enjoying clothes, still wanting to go to my grandma's place, talk about her aunt's closets, and check out her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to jail.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I walk dressed.
You know, we dancers are based on how we adjust to feel well on our clocks and trials when we look into the mirror.
And as an actress, if they give you a costume, then you'll really get into character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You've been 30 lately, you've been hit by a crisis?
No way.
I feel better than I've ever felt before, I'm having 30 fun.
I find that a woman is already finished, has experience and enjoys less mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
Since I've been doing what I want, it gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body wants to do it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don't want to miss it.
As far as my father's concerned, I'm not worried about it.
But one thing I know for sure, I'm going to let my child experience the feeling of happiness and bring him up with great love.
As far as the movie is concerned, you're looking forward to some of the film premieres you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to coming to the movies.
I come from the theater world, so I'm very impatient and restless, and I want everything right now, and I can't do that, of course.
I look forward to the premiere of "La útima hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the fashion parade by Naomi Campbell's side, didn't you?
Well, don't say it.
It's not like I'm going to go to the pier as a model.
She only called me Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and invited me to London to attend the benefit show for her organization "Women for a Better Life" and the clothes that we've presented - I also selected two models from our Mango collection -, had recovered and the proceeds were given to this Naomi non-governmental organization.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
A lot of things are talking about her and I, as I know her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good one he's involved in.
She asked me to show for charity, but when she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it too.
For the benefit of third-world women, I'll do whatever it takes.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will need to install an "alcolock"
The Home Office demands that the driver, with three administrative sanctions for driving under the influence of alcohol, must install a system in his car to prevent him from starting his vehicle drunky or if he doesn't breathe.
The proposal entered into the familiarity already in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme State Representation, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its goal is to return the driver behind the wheel, so the drivers will also have to attend the course of the transport gear.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Authority, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technology Institute for Car Safety (FITSA) will participate in this experience.
According to statistics between 30 and 75% of car drivers charged more than once for drunk driving again in this state will be spent on the wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this as it is a system attached to a vehicle which measures the level of alcohol in the exhaust air and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if it is recorded higher than the permitted alcohol concentration.
Its price is over EUR 1 000, and it would have to be paid itself by the culprit.
A study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that during the first year of introduction there was a 65 % reduction in the gap for vehicles equipped with this equipment.
In Spain, it counts to save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with this behaviour before it comes into play.
In order to assist its introduction, as legislation can be applied in the usual way, the necessary correction of criminal provisions requires amendment of the law.
The facilities are not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although in certain industrial vehicles and public service vehicles it has already been successfully installed.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on the draft PSOE (Spain's Social Socialist Party) in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as it is in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, at 17.40 hours, as it stood in the program, it landed in the presidential hangar at Benita Juárez airport in Mexico D. F. plane of Spanish air forces in which the prince and princess of Asturia arrived.
The sun just fell, however, his rays have so far forced their eyes to be set in order to be able to see the subsequent couple coming out of the plane.
Under the meeting, the Spanish ambassador and other officials stood.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi driver to know that the Spanish Prince and Princess are coming to a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, that's not gonna get to the airport to get people... she's from here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
But the Mexican press knows who the prince and princess are from Asturia and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in hangar at the airport just near the red carpet and the military court, which consists of 27 marine soldiers ready to shoot out an honest salvo.
The Prince appears with a smile on his lips in the suit of dark blue colors and princess, very soberly dressed and with open hair, has no usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that there is a storm in D. F.
Before they go to the hall, where the official delegates are waiting, they smile at the photographers and invite them unsolicitedly.
In the doors of the hotel, where they will be accommodated, one of the four biggest in the city, there is a famous Mexican TV reporter waiting for them.
Best awarded fashion price
I guess there's no more suitable place in the world for a fashion price than Paris, and I guess there's no more brilliant designer and bonvivain than Valentino.
Mango has just declared the second year of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow international presentation of new fashion talent.
The price is quoted by EUR 300 000.
Belgianka Sandra Fassoli, winner of the first year, looked at her proposals yesterday at Manga's position on Haussmann's Paris boulevard 54 and almost cried out to finish.
Of course, it is the second largest trade in this company in Europe and was just opened on an area of 1 335 square meters.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events together with the desire to thank designers of Valentin for taking on the Presidency of the Competition Court, caused us to have over-slept dinner in the Paris Opera Garnier.
Mango's company beautifully decorated chairboard looked next to the most famous Chagalls pieces.
Nati, who did not show anything with her heart broken grief because of her brother's recent death, wore on this brand's clothes and ELAH's jewels, where he was hiding his breath, and hung up to her son Luis - almost a two-meter elegance - accompanied Valentina at the head of the table at dinner at his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango's company, took a welcome and as a real gentleman he stayed with Baron Rothschild without an jacket because they were both offered to two ladies.
Mónicka Cruzová, who arrived at the store in - personally designed - pants and shirts, and at dinner she turned into long black sexy gowns, took a night walk after the Opera accompanied by Goyi Toled, showed us a room for ballet exams, and when she remembered other times she caught one of the bars and suggested "grand plié".
Inés Sastre did not hold off on a tour of the side buildings, but before leaving she showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we could enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who drives a motorcycle - and John Travolty, who arrived at the Paris Intercontinental Hotel with his own bed sheets and towels and asked in advance that no smell was used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Paris sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vii.
1001 - antistress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and escalated everyday life.
And so that there is little, they are all summarised in one book, which will bring them to bookshop relax on September 30th.
For example, they ring every morning at 7 hours as punishment, but it's even worse to imagine themselves absorbed in the fasting rhythm that brings present life.
The office's called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
There is, however, not one or two ways to combat everyday exhaustion and with problems to separate from the world of work.
No, that number is nothing bigger than 1001.
Susannah Marriott outside the yoga position, classical massage and "spa" therapy on the site of her book gathered the whole "men" options, modified according to taste and time options of each individual.
Protistres's book is called "1001 method of relaxation" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK's publisher will bring peace to the bookshop.
If anyone considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relations, the manual denys this view.
In addition, it offers other procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have adrenaline in your veins, which in your body reintroduces your balance, and stress becomes a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off and concentrate on reading.
Talking From Sleeping
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
When this happens for the first time, you may get scared, but in fact, it's meaningless.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called somnilolive.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, some of you were telling him that he was talking at night.
This phenomenon can occur very occasionally (for example, once in a lifetime of high fevers), or with greater periodicity (every day, once a week, once in a few months...), the second day, the child doesn't remember anything.
There is not only one reason to explain it.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night shorts, enuresis nightlife (night talk) or sleepwalking, but it may not be that way.
As mentioned earlier, sometimes very high fevers, stress and anxieties can be accompanied.
In any case, it's not a big deal.
The intensity she appears with is also different.
A child can speak with a calm voice, speak words, whisper, or just vice versa (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where he manifests himself with great strength, a child should be observed and advised by an expert to find out if there is a problem that causes great anxiety and thus manifests himself.
We have said that this is a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example if it is associated with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do this by remembering several very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to upset the child too much before he goes to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent television programs or shows.
It is possible to use relaxation techniques for very nervous children and for those who can work to help them get some inner peace.
This baby will allow a quieter sleep.
When the somnivove appears, try to maintain peace.
Remember, she's harmless for a child, and the next day she won't remember anything.
Useful advice
Don't be him.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're gonna break his sleep.
Even when he talks, he sleeps, and rests.
Remember that if you seem very concerned several times, it would be appropriate to turn to counsel or find out what causes such anxiety in your child.
If he understands what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to question him and draw information from him.
It won't do any good, because when she sleeps, she doesn't know she can arrange her thoughts.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he feels about, and why he says so, so take great care of how you interpret information and what conclusions you conclude.
Don't ever tell the baby you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not even from fun.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
Don't worry about it, it's not bad, it's just an episode that takes only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally.
After a long period of time, Illhaeusern finally found a way to win.
Without playing a particularly big game, the yellow-blacks created more chances and were able to turn one.
The game was not during this encounter, in which the attackers were difficult to enforce, too fast.
After the first attempt by the captain, Kauffmann, who shot from a distance just about a hair missed the link, began to have Illhaeusern slightly above and first, Fonnerflick from the distance, then Hirne air, Romain on a long foot, or also Diebold came in gradually to irritating defense Dannemaria.
On the other hand, he set up defense hall in the middle of the field and left only Agilní Riahi at the edge of the attack.
The beginning of the second half turned out to be decisive, first thanks to two Dannemaria's two chances with Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which he took care of Marais, well situated to process the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
However, Golman Illhaeuserna did not enjoy the pleasure long, and after about twelve minutes he was forced to go back to the dressing room and leave his teammates to weaken.
But Dannemaria couldn't get out of it, and eleven out of Illhaeusern, who just pulled away a little to "cuff" the defense, no more caused any more trouble, except for the very last few seconds of the match, when the ball went through a big mess very close to the shore.
Sarkozy goes to meet angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a trip through Brittany.
In order to face the demonstration of the forces of fishermen, who had strongly infringed the accessibility of several British and Normann ports on Monday, the French President decided on Tuesday morning to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit" and hope that "will come with concrete proposals".
The President's visit comes at the same time as the General Assembly of the "Crescent Committee" created by the British fishermen in order to obtain measures against a sharp increase in oil prices, which reached an average peak exceeding EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the spokesperson of the Elysian Palace of David Martinon with them, "will talk about solutions that can be seen in an attempt to help their companies regain competitiveness and better ensure the conditions for the employment and payment of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to be careless.
On Tuesday morning they performed an operation "seemíj" (operation slowly driving vehicles) in Morbihan and Calvados departments, which caused nearly 10km of backward.
The holiday port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections were not interrupted in the direction of Belle-île.
The filter dam was created on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors demonstrated their determination on Monday, when immediately before the fuel storage of the ports in Brest and Lorient burned the tyres and pallets, while the Concernau and Saint-Brieuc performed demonstrations.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the la Manche channel, like the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trailers remained in the port, or to Le Havru, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of a commercial ship.
The fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique during the evening stopped a block of important Total Refinery in Donges.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decided to act at the Ministry's Middle Meeting themselves.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "crisis committee" has to decide how to continue on the path, and how to participate in the prepared meetings at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not wish to be represented by leaders of the state fishing department who did not support their movement.
"The rest will continue" because the "fishers won't let go of anything" and "let go to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient fishing department.
The fishermen of the profession who do not pay the oil tax are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, but believe that the ship’s yield threshold is achieved only if the oil is below EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman
An unforgettable representative of "Butche Cassidy and Kida" died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes also bowed to the legend of the film and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
Brazil's aircraft manufacturer is relying on a delivery of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of recession, which is carried out over the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, maintains its supply assumptions for 2008, with 215 units added, confirmed by his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the period, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a lot from the Chinese market, particularly with regard to the range of his aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has supplied 41 instruments in the range of eight years to Chinese clients.
AIG says it considers the transfer of 15% of its assets
The American International Group, whose US money was over water, considers that more than 15% of its assets would go to pay $85 billion to him as an advance, writes the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to examine the sale of most of its activities outside life insurance activities in the international field and pension activities in the United States, explains the daily quoted sources of the ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, the Administrative Board of AIG met on Sunday during the evening to examine the event transfer.
Any confirmatory statement could not be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to dispose of include its airline lease of International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurance provider Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and investment in private equity, adds France Télécom.
No final decision on such withdrawals has yet been taken, continues France Télécom.
AIG must quickly obtain cash so that it can repay a loan of 85 billion, provided to it by the Federal Reserve with the risk that the US authorities will hold 80 % of the capital, at the same time divulging to the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historical meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historical decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the bank: Dow Jones lost 6,98%, which is an unprecedented loss of 800 points, and Nasdaq 9,14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
The greatest point drop in history (by 684,81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the renewal of the trade after terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq Index lost its technologicalally-dominated component, according to definitive data after trade closure, 199,61 points and settled at 1 983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 106,55 points.
From the beginning of the session, Wall Street has literally failed after the unexpected refusal of the plan to rescue the Bank of the House of Representatives, a plan that should have allowed it to rediscover a bit of stability on markets.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to provide the Treasury Secretary to Henry Paulson with the means he asked for.
Almost two Republicans of the three rejected his plan.
"It is a bad signal sent out by the market, which sees that Congress is unable to adopt a plan," says Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
"It shows how much he relied on this market plan," she added and expressed her concerns that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late".
"If this project is indeed doomed..., the relay will be immediately handed over to Fed (the American Central Bank, i.e. red.) and to other central banks to bless the crisis, which would further strengthen the credit conditions," pointed out Brian Bethune, head of the Global Insight economy.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza pointed out that in the United States, "every new day brings down one financial institution".
After the Friday's Washington Mutual crash, the authorities organized the redemption of Wachov's bank activities with her rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken turns and requested urgent intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets do not deal with "the American crisis but with the world crisis", he added analysts from FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The proceeds from the cash voucher to 10 years decreased to 3,632 % compared to 3,827 % on Friday evening, yield to 30 years to 4.161 % compared to 4,357 % of the previous day.
Obama won the first television duel points
After the first Friday debate between the two White House candidates followed the second debate to find out who won the couple John McCain and Barack Obama.
The command states of the Republican and Democrats campaign did not surprise them when they both declared their victory in the television duel that followed a third of America's families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not enough "brillant" to allow him to stop, five weeks before Presidential elections, a decline in surveys.
Gallp's constitution, whose public opinion poll published on Saturday assigns Obama a five-point lead (49% vs 44% for McCain), believes that democracy is the winner of the duel.
Between the undecided voters that matter right now, Obama is the winner of 39% of the questions, while, according to the CBS survey, 25% is attributed to McCain’s victory.
Obama should have the opportunity to confirm his leadership on Thursday through the anticipated good performance of his fellow-in-chief Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time a single public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She is gifted," however, said Bill Clinton on the weekend.
Seventy-seventh McCain systematically raised his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while stressing the "permanence" of his opponent on issues that were the core of the first clash.
"It seems Senator Obama didn't understand that..." there were repeated charges.
"I do not think Senator Obama would have had sufficient experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
In such an offensive spirit, since yesterday's Republican TV spots.
On the other hand, Obama stressed that it was the future.
He didn't lose his head and turned out to be brief and precise.
He lifted up his ability to take the right decision and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still does not understand, while Obama does," he said to the Republicans on the weekend of a democratic spot, which reads that he does not take enough into account the impact of the crisis on a 'problem American'.
"In the 90th-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama yesterday to the 20 000 people gathered at the election meeting in North Carolina for a sharp rain.
He didn't even say the words "the middle class" or "working." The financial breakdown clearly favours Obama, whom the Americans consider to be more qualified to save the economy at the edge of the gap.
"The next week could be the decisive turn," estimated yesterday's powerful democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's "economic transparency" to the one Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For a democratic candidate, today's disaster is the "the ultimate vendetta of eight years' bad economic policy, as George Bush operated it, and how Senator McCain supported it".
The Senator of Illinois again confirmed that despite the unexpected jumps of Wall Street, he should be subject to a reduction of 95 % of Americans' taxes, and he also pointed out that the implementation of the country’s inventory of energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is its priority number one, together with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain is planning to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided the issues relating to the financial assistance plan $700 billion (470 billion euros), which was adopted yesterday evening by Congress and which is strongly unpopular.
"What about you, have you noticed that there was a choice in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday night at the central square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night immediately after the conclusion of electoral rooms on the main square in Minsk to protest against the integrity of elections to Parliament.
Although no results have been announced yet, many young people have come to demonstrate against the regime of President Lukashenko: "Dictor, Demosi".
Some admit that they didn't even vote, "What it would be for when they were doing what they wanted to do with my voice," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which was held in a friendly manner with regard to foreign observers in order to restore negotiations with the European Union, would be prepared to make a turn towards democracy.
Penalties, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian masters and the freezing of certain assets, could be cancelled if the elections are considered to be clean.
According to the opposition, that's not what it was.
"We were kept away from the electoral committees and our observers could not participate in the census," complained Juri Potěmkin, spokesperson of the Union of democratic forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"It is about cosmetic change," stressed Alexander Milinkiewicz, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, and the leading personality of the pro-European movement, "because the important is who counts the votes, and it is our powerful power.
If any opposition Members get to Parliament, it will be by appointment and not elected.
However, their entry into Parliament may mean space on television, meetings in regions and legal designs."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because "it is necessary to launch dialogue with the European Union.
If our economy, deeply in debt with Russia, is going to hit the crisis and we are not reforming, we are threatened to become Russia's protector.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which follows the elections, should not declare elections valid.
It stresses that participation seems to be too high and that the general introduction of the early vote (26%) opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What, did you notice that some elections took place?" is involved in the socio-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no foot in the electoral rooms.
And there will be no more than five opposition Members in Parliament who comply most with the regime."
The night silence was again restored to the October square.
On TV, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate their success.
Interview - Blood, which is again certain
Hema-Quebec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly glad because Hema-Quibec became one of the most reliable and effective suppliers of blood in the world.
First of all, he regained public confidence after a scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the state reserve of blood administered by the Department of Transfusion of the Canadian Red Cross has been contaminated with type C immune deficit virus (HIV) and hepatitis virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and wave, the government of Canada, in February 1994, initiated a public investigation which was chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which was intended to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and to formulate recommendations that such disaster should no longer be repeated.
While Judge Krever opened a report, some of the provinces put into operation a committee aimed at planning a new system of blood management in Canada.
In Quebebek, Géline’s Committee established this role.
After Gélineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who was supposed to supply Québec and Canada's blood company to supply all provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Quebec started his activities in 1998, only 38% of people had yet to trust in the quobec blood system," Dr. Décary recalls.
"The situation was dazzling.
The joint efforts to increase the safety of blood products and the permanent work in this area over the years have been regained by public confidence," he says and proudly adds that in early 2008, Héma-Québek had trusted nearly 94% of the Québek population.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998 Hema-Quebec applied the prudential principle.
"Now we have seen in Europe the occurrence of many cases of human disease of crazy cows, the new variants of disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says the woman who has been leading the company since its establishment in 1998.
"And we had no idea whether this disease could spread through blood.
We have therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of Kreverov and Gélineau report, which, in case we do not know this and when it is at stake as a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, which is characterised by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, excluding measures must be taken.
In April 1999, we refused blood from people who had been in the United Kingdom since 1980 for more than one month.
A few years ago, it was safely proved that this disease was passed by blood.
So this episode showed us that keeping to the prudence principle had meaning."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique appeared on the market for finding HIV: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) which allow detection in donor blood directly the presence of the virus itself, and not the presence of antibodies on which the tests used earlier were based.
The NAT tests allowed the deaf period to be reduced between the moment the patient was infected and the moment our blood techniques could be exposed to the first viruses, explains the specialist.
We've been able to cut this period short for less than a week.
We have substantially reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing about it and without finding out.
This improvement has made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of AIDS through blood transfusion.
The risk of getting HIV contaminated blood is now exposed to one person from 12 million.
In other words, 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
In view of the fact that Hema-Québec distributes every 40,000 to 500 000 blood products every year, 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission occurs through the blood product.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe blood transfusions necessary for recovery," says Héma-Quebek's boss.
"The challenge for the next decade is to preserve the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of disease element could occur in the system.
Just last year, a chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transferred to blood by stabing insects.
Dr. Décary has to be constantly cautious, and he stresses that in addition to safe supply, Héma-Québec must also count on supplies sufficient.
"The need is growing because the population is ageing.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the network of blood donors, which is, on average, composed of only 3 % of Québečians eligible for donation."
Any healthy person aged at least 18 years, corresponding to the eligibility criteria, but may donate blood only once every 56 days, that means six times a year.
14% of people who offer blood are not on average because they are, for example, carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited the country where the mud colds run, they are excluded for one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain a condition that matches the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be complementary to how old they get and can no longer give blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give blood, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unconnected today that we will rarely find an hour to donate blood," Francine Décary will look.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Quibec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, oculars and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before they are stored with Héma-Quebek, who also manages the only public blood bank from the Québek era.
The umbilical cord, previously considered as biomedicine waste, flows blood rich in stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia.
"For a few weeks we have celebrated the deposit of our thousand blood sample from the umbilical cord to the bank and we expect to take over a thousand each year.
At the beginning of next year we should start offering them for transplantation," explains Dr. Décary, who describes the blood collection program from the umbilical cord as a very popular one.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Hema-Québec does not have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Québek.
Football - Impact in semifinals
Imact Montréal took place yesterday at the Saputo Stadium during the second and at the same time the decisive match of the fourth-final played on the total number of goals he qualified for the semifinal round of the first USL division, thanks to victory 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over Sounders of Seattle.
Antonio Ribeiro gave the decisive goal in the 90th minute game.
After two-sided first half-in-a-half, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino’s remaining two goals of montreal formation were increased.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan for Sounders.
Let us remind you that on Friday, during the first two games of the quarterfinals, Impact suffered at Starfire Complex in Tuquila on the suburb of Seattle defeat 2:1.
Imact will measure its forces in semifinal with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota he compared Thunder in his home match the deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, the Whitecaps nevertheless proceeded to the semifinal round with the total number of goals 5:4.
Imact should meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will be confirmed today.
Short - Kovalev’s winning goal
The first assaulting triple canadien is ready to start the season.
A unit composed of Alex Kovaleva, Tomáš Plekance and Andrei Kostcin last night at Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kostcin, the greatest star of clash, scored a goal, Plekanec gathered two assists and Kovalev gathered one match in this fourth win of three-coloured six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured victory by giving a single goal during separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," said Russia.
"I need another game to make me feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to handle too much," noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice applause."
Charest bets north
The Prime Minister does not rule out that he will launch early elections by the end of the year
After the end of the convention, the Liberal Party (Parti libéral) moved Jean Charest to Jean-Talon in Québek, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) stands in today's complementary elections.
"Remove the border of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest introduced visually in a convening way yesterday at the end of the convention of the Liberal Party to Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, pictures in some picture mill were shown behind his back.
On three defensive canvass, the loop ran with remarkable pictures of hydroelectric dams, down, Québek from the perspective of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means, just like in the election period.
After all, at the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that early elections in the fall, although he pointed out that he had a very busy program.
The Sever MEP is the fourth dimension of the "vise" that the Prime Minister intends for Québec, the vision of the "new economic area", which includes an agreement with France on the workforce, the Convention between Canada and Europe and the Agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North Land in the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has often mentioned in his statements recently, the presentation has never been the subject.
However, the Prime Minister has limited himself to explaining why Sever represents a "dark with enormous potential", but it has not shown the date, the amount of investment, nor the clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further developed: in particular water plants, forests, but above all the important sector, encouraged by the growth of emerging countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
Sever, according to Charest's reading, contains "no nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "terrible land twice the size of France is here," it's in Québek.
And it is not just with us, but it is in us," he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he called on a certain national founding myth.
Québec was built to a great extent in relation to the North, he highlighted the Prime Minister: a pursuit for gold in Abibi, Québian engineering, James' bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after he had shut down theatrely to take a look at the huge map behind his back.
North, 70% of the territory of Québek, includes a part of Labrador, which was always requested by Québec, specified the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"One of the traditional attitudes that repeated all the previous governments.
There is one border line that has been no Convention for a long time and if there is a suitable opportunity, in the name of the government, I will re-occupied this position," he said.
Otherwise, "it is also necessary to rethink our North vision in relation to climate change", he said when he talked about the north-west transition that would open all year round as a result of ice management.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that it becomes a duty to seize the territory.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the original nations, and the Inuite?
The Prime Minister said that the Quaébian government would be very thoughtful to them and that the project would be useful to them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pequist MEP from Ungava) have already launched negotiations with about thirty communities.
He opened an interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which he has an important position of Julie Boulet (Transport and natural resources).
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "the common vision will be set out".
Indeed, the development of the North should take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visi" as a continuous follow-up to the vision of liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"As liberals before us, we have changed our minds to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
Such was, in fact, one of the ongoing topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a big cocktail elevating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's accession to the forehead of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to convert Beauharnois’ headquarters to the Adélard-Godboutov dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Quebec, through Lesage, who conducted a peaceful revolution and nationalization of water electricity, to the Bourussu created by James' bay, our side managed to shape the future," Jean Charest said.
At the press conference he appealed to further authority, this time conservative, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, premiered between 1957 and 1963.
When the line came to Eastmain1a-Ruper’s dam hydroelectric power plant, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I only say it between us, but I plan to be in the process," said his member base, creating considerable applause.
The same prime minister, who said in April, will not be elected in 2008, and certainly not in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of launching elections in the autumn of this year, allowing him a law.
However, he stressed that his programme was loaded, especially the mission of the federal council in China and the Québec-New York summit.
The weekend convention gave the liberals the platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "to amend the constitution" which went very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal Party Québek) calls for a special recognition of Québek's "specificity" in the Constitution.
He also wishes that Québec appoint part of the members of the Canadian Radio and Television Council, who would have the right of veto in the event of decisions taken in Québek.
On the opposition side, the North Plan was accepted skeptically in its main features.
Head of PQ (Parti Québekois) Pauline Marois again pulled out the Politician development of the north of Québek which Landry’s government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, it became a failure to fill this policy.
If she would stick to her, "we would continue today", noted Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) François Mercure.
The ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in government.
"However, we wish it not a mere theatre," explains Sébastien Proulx, a leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning today from the holiday.
Letters - Disappointed Country
He was Vic Toews, an excellent "justice" (OIronia) artist in Harper's cabinet, who allowed himself to say about Louis Arbor last summer that he represents a shame for Canada.
This is how a woman who has waged an unscrupulous fight for justice and who deserves all our admirers, speaks much of the Prime Minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper's very own.
We have before us a government that, as one of all the participating Western countries, has not moved back to its nation's homeland closed down in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
The government, which does not even consider that, at the time of the actions that were exposed to it, Omar Khadr was a juvenile adolescent.
The only government, which although Canada signed a Women's Convention, denied its word and lets rot under the human conditions of a child soldier.
The only one relying on a parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Let us remind you that UNICEF, Amnesty international, and in particular the Association of Canadian lawyers, are defending Omar Khadra's repatriation in order to find a fair process in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes before torture: it does not care that this young man is psychologically destroyed at the same time, no doubt, after so many years of torment.
We don't realize it, but we are just witnessing the fury erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', the words that Harper's making out so much of, and which from his mouth sounds so empty.
The time has come when there is no morale: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him badly, to arrest him according to the libov's boss until now of the minority government (as it will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that proclaims virtue, the law and the Order: they cannot see that this government has renounced what created the reputation and seriousness of our country.
The shame is, Mr. Toews, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - The Orwell discussions of Barrick Gold
In his 17th September edition, Le Devoir printed Patrick J. Garver's letter, the executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With the Orwell logic, it confirms that the world’s largest gold producer has begun to prosecute three authors and a poor little publisher for insulting honors in order to call for a "transparate public debate" and calls for six million.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of prosecution for an insult to honor, but the law.
It is not surprising that Garver completely ignores this fundamental distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to lead a public debate, bring about a misty of anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the process occurs, the authors and publishers of the Noir Canada book (Black Canada) will be forced to spend valuable sums in order to be prepared to fight and fight in a very unbalanced fight with the army of lawyers supported by nearly a bottomless pocket of the mining company.
The tactics in these unbalanced fears, however, often consist in ruining the defendants for the purpose of prosecuting the proceedings which will cling to the mouth of the counterparty and also hang out anyone who dares to give this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have presented her view of the whole matter with public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, there is a debate in Canada under normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas and not in the wounds of the baton.
In other words, the media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole of the matter was not enough than opening their books, documentation and real debate.
However, barrick Gold seems to have no trust in public opinion and smash rejects petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can call for a "public debate" and also reject the views of the public?
It seems that this word in the vice president's world refers only to fat-paid lawyers, and not to all Canadians; it is a very narrow concept of this term.
In democracy, the Nazis also have the right to apologize.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so mainly because he rejects brutal ways of mining society.
The public is ready to hear and assess Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in the context of what many view as a prosecution in which the defendant should be blocked by the mouth (in the context of its prosecution of "public debate" Barrick, by the way, just gave an official call to Noir Canada authors to officially announce that they are to stop using this term...).
If we ignore the surreal Garver speech, the pursuit of the initial Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university freedom of research and the search for truth, which is essential for every democratic society.
In total, he denys the right to quote credible resources and to debate the facts and interpretations which constitute the basis for intellectual activity itself.
If it is in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world without presenting ourselves with repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could create it if it followed the scientific standards used by the Noir Canada authors.
He has the right to answer.
The international environment to which we belong can manage debate and disagreements recently and the settlement of conflicts.
The excessive complaint by Barrick Gold clearly shows that despite what they are saying, it does not taste any less to lead a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world as well as for a public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures such as this type of unauthorized complaint to limit.
Operations to rescue Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
Bush's administration and leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, came to agreement yesterday on the largest rescue plan since the great crisis of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan, as with the $700 billion, the financial crisis, which has been clouding Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both Chambers of Congress.
In particular, it assumes: better control of elected representatives over its applications, new mechanisms to ensure payment of paid public money, new measures to capture the amount of houses seized due to non-payments and also the right to monitor the wages paid to the managers of the rescue companies.
The US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi, and representatives of the Republicans at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight after the end of the two-day negotiations marathon.
"We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"It was all done so that the real economy and common Americans were safe from the crisis currently on Wall Street," explained the Democrat.
"This is a crucial point: if we don't do this, trauma, chaos and the disruption of American everyday life will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, negotiations have taken place at the highest turn from fear of the effect that there should be another failure to set up investors.
The time limit determined was to open the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the U.S. President were invited to negotiate later, and they both expressed themselves in favour of the agreement, but they did not forget to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that it was necessary to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has agreed to supplement the agreement on certain measures, in particular to allow owners to maintain their residence and measures to be taken on the wages of the state of work saved companies.
"If we ask taxpayers to take special measures for the irresponsibleness of some people, there is nothing to congratulate on.
These measures are, however, necessary," explained on the waves of television.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was questioned by another station, whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see details, but I hope so."
"The rough features I've read, [show] it's about something that we all have to spend and what can be done further.
Choose inactivity is simply unacceptable," he said.
The aim of the 700 milliliard plan is to purchase, for money, the payers, the questionable claims and the risk and non-sale assets of the US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis driven by a bubble in the real estate market, which led first to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then moved to further, extended forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and in the settlement of banks and financial institutions.
The failure of the first draft agreement last week is made by Republican Members.
Since the Democrats have come to believe that, for some "toxic" assets of companies having difficulties, the government will only guarantee, but it does not buy them, it is convinced that the unconditional situation is blessed.
In order to bring the opposite views of Congress closer, measures have been adopted to determine that the government will be able to introduce new charges which would help it get its deposit back if, as a result of the programme, it will have to take over the losses for five years.
The new plan calculates the first deposit of 250 billion, to which it will be possible to add another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The addition of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help Washington will receive shares in protected companies, which will pay him dividends in the event of profit, and which will be able to sell again when it's over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the arrangements for the seizure of property associated with the loans to which the plan relates, as well as to set limits for the amount of assessment and compensation paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The leaders of the plan would like to vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain that their plan will be green.
Yesterday, voices both in the Republic and in the democratic camp continued to be raised against this project.
"It's absolutely obvious Washington can't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, member of the House's Financial Commission.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But it is not a solution to make money on payers."
The Democratic representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen called the "sceptics committee", presents the whole matter differently, but the same conclusion occurs.
"Four hundred respected professors of economics, among them three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us: we ask Congress to be too hasty and carefully researched which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe was once again confirmed that this crisis was a global crisis.
At the end of the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced a partial nationalisation of Fortis bank group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg has become necessary after the French bank, BNP Paribas, has announced that it is going away from buying its competitors, which is at the expense of collapse since it lost EUR 2 billion (EUR 2,9 billion) as a result of the crisis of risk loans to buy real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the 20 largest European banks and among the ten largest insurers.
"We will not lose this money," said the Dutch Minister of Finance Woter Boss yesterday.
"In return we get electoral right in the bank and influence.
And that's what the compatriots and household can appreciate in today's uncertain times."
On the other hand, the Channel La Manche so far seems to have begun the British government nationalised another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, more than 41 billion ($75 billion) of which were loans to buy real estate.
According to its notification yesterday, the Spanish Bank will buy out branches and accounts of its clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British Government must nationalize since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially involved icons
His beauty with azure eyes has long represented his coffin, according to other weaknesses.
Has this American actor been stoned with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The stamina, sensitivity, and unscrupulous talents that were his own have also given him away from the force category that yields true stars.
But what a long tracker it was!
Paul Newman died on Friday in 83 years at his ranch in Connecticut due to lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of America's cinematography.
Less spectacular than Brando, who was similar and long had been his rival on film canvas, Newman was a more careful actor, truly fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and disintegrating dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was a Hungarian.
One of the famous faces of the American dream was born from these European roots.
Without an excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in him the whole country fell in love with self made mana, a warrior in the Pacific War, wounded in battle, who studied acting in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s, then attended New York Actor's Studio and celebrated the triumph in the theatre, on television and weight in the movie.
The same man, who fought for civil rights, was also a car racer, who was placed as the second at the 24 hour race in Le Mans in 1979, and at the same time a sexual symbol, yet since 1958 he created a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward.
It also leaves a mere place of this hidden, discreet, socially involved stars, allergic to the habit of own show-business, which will always remain mysterious to some extent.
A fine man, in the most noble sense.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused a dizziness to film lovers while his great roles are competing on black canvas memories.
After that, more than half a century, the constantly transforming American seventh art.
In memory, the charming cowboys of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid are reinvented, a young man who refuses his conspicuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a hot roof, adaptation of Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From a less ancient past (1990) we recall his sensitive Mr Bridge, restless in the advanced age of marriage, which did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have come into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, threatened, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In your hate mark) Robert Wise, a role designed for James Dean, taken over after his death, which in 1956 Newman reported in true knowledge.
Sympathic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting (Rating), Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
The bitter and vengeful pool player in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same figure as the one at The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, bringing him the only Oscar in 1987 from seven nominations.
This face passing ages, it was him.
And him again.
In his line of work, there are various ages competing together.
Young people first of all know it because of the cult Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) of Reggie Dunlop's role as a non-traditional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudson, Coen Brothers.
He then completed his career as a godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends, which relatively soon left the craft, Newman stayed in the business for a long time, even though he judged Hollywood with his gold pieces, captivities and retreats.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "for a live challenge of underplay", judging by the fact that in his performance he too pushed too much on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a tray, she was not always as tender to professions.
However, the first lovers played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps and desperates, whose falling and rioting reflected in his perfect features.
As director of Newman, he revealed few familiar aspects of his shy sensitivity.
His movie Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (by the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played, provides a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
His son Scott, whom he lost because of his overdose, was dedicated in 1984 to Harry and Son, a work full of shame and sorrow.
In the favor of honors received yesterday from Newman, his great friend and former co-warrant Robert Redford (played together in the Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: "His presence was my life and this country better."
The greatness, the love of life, such are the main qualities of the dead actor.
If we forget his legendary career, there is also a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, an independent film, a opponent of Hollywood's bankruptcy.
His likeness was used to seeing wine vinegar, sauce, biscuits and other foods on bottles of wine, which may have seemed quite inconvenient to us, although at first it was a gag.
However, profits from sales went to his Foundation account for heavy childhood.
Newman was, rather than having the glory around him, engaged in society until the last moment.
He left his five daughters a letter containing the following sentences: "Always, and until the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor for me to be here."
And for us it was an honor to follow the path of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & spol. invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, he will begin trial proceedings against János Zuschlagov and his companions.
Politics and his associates are, in addition to other crimes, including forgery, accused of fraud committed in the long term and systematically by a criminal organisation that caused extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutor's office, they used money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and often submitted fiscal invoices.
Money from the state and the government - including some 65 million forints - was part of the Fiatal Balldal Treasury office, part of which were the pockets of individuals.
The method that the investigating authority had also informed was that the money obtained in public competition had never been collected on the basis of invoices for which it had not been effectively re-evaluated and the undertakings received by the associations had never been met.
According to the prosecution, a large part of the invoice was fake.
The forms for these invoices came from the Yazsefvárosian market, the round stamp was produced in Kiskunnhalasi.
The name on which the companies are to make invoices is to run has, inter alia, decided to cross the northern bank of Balaton, on which Istvána Ladose János Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, his first name was to see the boarding house and restaurants.
In them he applied for consumption accounts, according to which they were then produced invoices presented in the public competitions recorded among other things by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively by the Municipal Authority.
The invoices were mostly presented by István Lados with his companion Andrs îrim, who, according to our information, most frequently wrote the reports needed to obtain the subsidy.
Lados watched a beerhouse during his "student trip".
According to the two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its associates in 2003, the following food service facilities were provided for the ninety-member group of Biztos Pont.
However, so many people would suddenly not fit in according to the company leader’s claim.
As was the case with formal and content errors of invoices issued in summer 2002 by the Foundation named Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért.
The guest house in Badacsonytomyji had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet a hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, the press publishers with a rich imagination exceeded this even when they submitted to documents from a company devoted to the same hospitality - Pigal s. o., in which accounting according to the information provided to the state representation of documents appearing in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even set up.
Head of the company Győző Farkas for hvg.hu said that when he was summoned to the D.A. and showed him invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number was in the wrong place."
As he added, in addition to formality, the fact that they accommodated a hundred people according to the invoice is that they have only 11 rooms with no capacity.
In addition, dietary food was also mentioned in the invoice, and their restaurant has been out of service for a long time.
Even the hot invoice producers did not testify that the search for Budapest’s travel agency organized only foreign travels, and the cash payment invoice, which also did not match the company’s billing practice, reported it as a service to broker Hungary’s travel.
In addition, as occurred during the investigation, VAT was also stated in the document, although the organisation of travels to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
On four documents exposed to the Jobb Jövőrért, Hotel Révfülöp did not agree, among other things, to VAT. The company’s activities were not covered by the above 25 %, but 15 % VAT, except that the hotel’s employees had only printed invoices, however, the invoice produced was written by hand.
In addition, they rejected the invoice's "exporters" by stating, in one company, how it came out due to the investigation of the state representation, as the business of road transport of goods which the company originally did not carry out on investment advice.
The fact that the invoices issued by Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and the XXI associations are invoiced. The Szzadi Kulturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont false, in addition it was also established due to formal deviations - non-responsible invoice format and false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or Sport Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that they would issue invoices.
For example, counterfeiters did not notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregiázíchza was at a time (2001) when a group from the Fiatatal Varosert, was in liquidation, which is why according to our information, the company's liquidization commissioner also denied that the paper would issue it.
The invoices were displayed consciously
The second group of billings consists of those who knew they were supposed to set up a fictional invoice.
The Estély Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for approximately four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of the Financial Balledal - Ifjú Szocilistak organization.
Collab s. r. o. forced one of the accused Ludovic Györfi to issue a fiscal account under appeal.
Zuschlag and his associates also cooperated with Biogate s. o., currently in liquidation, which supplied Jobb Jövőrt and Atlasz and Vörösfenyő with invoices worth approximately five million forints, for which there was no real economic activity.
Neither the movement of money, because the invoices created were subsequently ruined, which the organisation had forgotten to mention in their documents.
The other group of billing companies is those that had ties to the defendants.
For example, Iván Kubatov was appointed representative of the Ukrainian director Delta Trió s. r. o., involved in the trading of fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not available.
In October, November and December 2005 the company issued several invoices for the sale of computing equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment s. o. company which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
A member of this company was a man from Romania, whom he was supposed to hand over letters in the years 2002-2005 concerning Iván Kubatov.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he, on behalf of the company, issued invoices to Atlas, Hoppá and Együttt Foundation and Harmadik Évezredért himself accepted their counter-reference.
At the request of Ivána Kubatova, the company Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
However, neither of the companies actually worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
Yet, the companies were in favour of him, because at the request of the co-founded lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their loading list, he issued invoices to the Atlas and Y-Generocó associations connected to Zuschlag on behalf of the company.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The state representation considered that Kubatov had lost 10% of the amounts on invoices and VAT.
In order to set out fiscal invoices, this time to tender for Biztos Pont, a man also used Szi-Beri k.t.
In January 2006 Y-Generacíó and Szövetség and Modern Magyarszágért submitted proposals for the public competition of the Mihálye Táncsicse Foundation (TMA), a public service organization of socialist parties.
They obtained 500 thousand forints, but did not spend the amounts on the targets set in the proposals.
To avoid this, TMA submitted five fiscal invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found at home search in the office of Arpda Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the presentation of the part of the defendants, it is likely to describe the course of the invoice production, as it has already done at the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if he decides to reveal everything himself to the principal accused János Zuschlag.
His testimony is not yet very detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will lay it out widely, he has not done so yet.
The question is whether it's in his interest - in exchange for a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, maybe the socialists made a deal with him, and Zus will take it on.
In fact, he could have been offended so far because his application to mitigate the conditions of his detention, namely to place in house arrest, remained unheard at all times.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have committed much more harm than they have not yet paid, can walk freely or at least wait for the end of their conduct, he does not have this possibility.
Psychology of Trusting: why spend more money?
In the auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, to overpower the goods.
Neurological and Economic Basis of this familiar - and seemingly irrational - behavior managed to reveal to researchers from the field of neurology and economics of New York University.
According to their study published in Science Magazine, people do not want to stay in the eBay auction competition, so they prefer to pay too much price.
Research using the experimental auction tried to map this "game" scheme in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers planted, the second group participated in a playful auction, with active magnetic resonance (fMRI) methods examined active areas of the brain of test subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but when playing on auction, which is an important element to bridge the other side, the whole, which is located under the brain's bark, began to work intensively while playing.
This brain area plays, in addition to many other functions, a role in the "sebed-change" mechanism of the nervous system.
It is therefore possible, according to researchers, to explain the effort to avoid a sharp reaction of the striata.
In support of their theory, members of the research team have conducted financial cross-cutting investigations from among economists.
On different terms, three groups were auctioning against one partner.
The control group was simply informed about the real value of the product and they made bets.
In addition, members of the other group were promised that if they come out of the game winning, they'll get 15 more dollars for the reward.
The third group received 15 dollars on the contrary before the auction, but in the case of losses its members also lost this money.
So the difference between the two groups involved all of them in the fact that one was highlighted by the victory and the second loss.
However, the members of the group playing "against the fall" were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "wine" group, which confirms the hypothesis of the neurological.
"These results cannot be derived from any preexisting economic theory.
For they have explained to date the phenomena observed in auctions with joy from victory and the avoidance of risk.
Until the neurological imaging methods helped us solve the conflict between the two theories, so that we have now reached the third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of New York University.
Hepatitis: When to seek a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and this chronic liver disease is then reported among the main causes of death.
The number of home cases of hepatitis is estimated at 100 thousand, but only 7 thousand of them are treated, and the reason why sick people often do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the cumulative name of infectious liver damage caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, symptoms of inflammation of the liver and gallbladder, but the origins of the disease and the diseases they have caused are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the origins of diseases, spread two main ways of: hepatitis type A and E digestion (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (sperma, vaginal secret, saliva).
Travellers should in any case protect themselves by vaccination against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against virus type C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the use of infected food, usually associated with nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, urges to vomiting.
Then, on the skin and eye whites, a gallbladder, light stools, and light urine can be formed, and treatment can take two to three weeks.
Each year, millions of people around the world die of serious disease, liver cancer and hepatic cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only every tenth infected medication is treated.
Also, hepatitis C may have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to hepatic cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected with their disease don't even know the originator of the disease destroys the liver cells in sick, and so the first symptoms will occur in many cases up to 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to in-depth prevention, to make regular depreciations.
In three groups this disease occurs more often than on average: among people who have undergone blood transfusions before 1991, between drug users and tattoo users.
The expected global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million is currently expected.
Since the disease can prove a routine laboratory examination, a person should be contacted by a physician if he has recorded any sign of unknown origin.
In early detection, the disease is healable, the virus can be removed from the body and thus prevented from being infected and prevented from developing cancer.
30 September is the world's day of hepatitis, which was organised worldwide for the first time by the organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by these viruses, the causes and importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Who believes in God doesn't hurt so much?
According to recent research, faith works in God as some analgesic that could make death easier for Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment, examining the way in man influences faith in the god of feeling pain, informed the British daily Telegraph.
Within the time of the bizarre survey, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists to electrical shocks, while all observed the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to the techniques of a detailed examination of the human brain, it turned out that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that was responsible for controlling the pain.
Research is the first of a series of research, attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
A fully tested test was carried out by hand-to- left-hand test subject to a sparking instrument that gave out electrical shocks.
Researchers asked participants to closely observe two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary, originating in the 17th century and the Lady of the Countess Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of Our Lady would cause a certain state of piety for believers, while Da Vinci’s image was chosen because it was not very different from the first time and acted as a comforting impression.
Test subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner, and during that time they got in four consecutive parts of 20 electroshocks, while they followed the picture separately with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics indicated that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as if "delivered" of them and "speaked, filled them with peace".
They felt 12 percent less pain when they had Leonard's work before them when they watched the painting with religious themes.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who has also participated in research, believes that such an effect can be achieved with any powerful image even in atheists, only the right photography needs to be found.
"We need to find a painting that will feel very positive from the position of mother or father," the psychologist said.
The English bishop Tom Wright welcomed research results.
"Practicing faith should change, and in many cases will change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a matter of what effect on regulating the pain of believers should have shown them some madone by Leonard or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would a look at the quality of Miss Maria be able to achieve even better results?
You're what you're going to share
Google can declare its tenth birthday that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their head; they know where they were on vacation, what professional examinations are and what they are interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses is still not enough.
However, as regards skeptics, doing parallel with Orwell's dark vision, these are not the very very essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently expressed his voice for the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to collect even more personal data on users, which is necessary for Google's founders to stick to their original purpose, which said, "Let's set up all the information in the world!"
According to the announced Googlu representative, the company is only in the beginning after ten years of global work so that it can work with all information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt answered that he would like Google to answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what job would it really be good for me?" - on such seemingly simple questions, however, software won't be able to answer until they know enough information about users.
Not all Internet users know that during the internet search, search words and words from which IP addresses were sought and on which pages were moved.
Thanks to Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, keep up the history of their surfing, see back what they were looking for and click on, which will then generate findings adapted much more directly to us - on the same logics it will also base the Recommendations service, through which the system will be offered to us on the basis of previously mentioned and preserved preferences to offer products and services.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm looking at? - People are asking when they look at Google's data monopoly for fear.
In most cases, the range of potential power represented by the company is more serious, and counter-reaction does not cause awareness of the guilt in Internet users, fear of being punished, desire for freedom, or even a rebellion against power.
However, it is confirmed that all the terms sought are not only captured but, in justified cases, may also be issued by a third party, in such legal cases, the personal rights of internet users will not prevent anything.
The most famous example of the last time was probably coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from the community websites of Orkut, set up through it.
However, Internet users who are worried about personality rights could still breathe in May when the company’s hand in hand with the EFF’s electronic rights organisation successfully proved its truth in dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced in the future to provide any classified information to the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought nearly 50 000 web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it received in response to the reinforcement of the passed year ago by the Law on the Protection of Children, however it failed to get lists of searchable entries of individual users, respectively full lists of websites and key words covering two months.)
The view on Google is so wide-ranging: it is being beaten by those who are afraid to provide their personal data, because it feels that their intimate sphere and private life will be caused by starting to use Google services, exposed to harm, and who are facing it with a revolution, which belongs to transnational companies with conservative image.
And so far, the American geek culture and its wild oddédé, gathering around each other excited computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees a new generation by a large-scale, "corporation, what is now going on", unlike his Microsoft rival, considered because of Windows as the conqueror of the world, however they both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require identification code from its users and does not want money for them for its application; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs, works as much more accessible, more juvenile, "coolier", than the practice of the official software giant.
However, it may also be due to the fact that geeks precisely understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personal rights, which brought about just one of the most inclined key words of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is not anything but cooperation, that we deliberately leave behind our tracks and use the communication channels that we have at our disposal, and although their range is the same for everyone else, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can run a profile right on several community pages from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm applications, recording the music they listen to, then all of this can connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, except for that, he can write a blog on which his latest photo gallery will automatically appear on Flickr or Picase.
At the same time, we can read about a lot of experimental cases, from which it invites: a friend in the morning looking at the flood of photos of joint friends easily finds out who her famous friend spent the evening with, or she can throw out her worker only because of his sincere opinion on leadership on her blog: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely reviewed today.
The person who lives online is made up of what shows himself, so we could define the basics behind the behavior of today's youth.
And who wants to hide something, or at least avoid the googlian monopoly, has the option (starting, for example, the Scash, which uses the Google search system, but does not deliberately leave any traces).
A small number of people, for example, do not register on community websites to be found. Online Googlu application from text editor to photoeditor and a news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which will not produce the best possible profile.
Public opinion does not secretly expect Google to show teeth.
The business has a value of $156 billion more than IBM (140 billion), Intel (140 billion) or Coca Cola (110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising space threatens investment in advertising agencies and services introduced at a faster pace, they seriously depress Microsoft's life, but also numerous other software designers.
However, critical observers also find counterpoints that are disturbing by the impression: for example, the chief leadership has completely rejected the protests of employees after double the fee for corporate school, any frequent daily diet of employees was too expensive according to the company's management, but all of this is lost in addition to the fact that Google was still bowing down to the Chinese government in 2006 and, in the sense of their agreement, filter out every find that adds to the good taste, respectively, to the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company is that it never advertises new services, only when it can be used again, but it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years can bend the world in new places: while some believe that the Google project focused on scanning and archiving books and magazines acquires such proportions that the company will soon have something to do with the US Supreme Court, others are scared of its health system, because we can build up our own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google builds up a genetic database, then can serve as a good starting material for the following generation of sci-fi writers, the famous novel of Cory Doctor "ScWD" describes the Orwell Reminiscences of the future, in which man can be easily approached only with the help of Google data.
The double killer of Ozd helped to remove the traces of two minors
Two youths interviewed the police on a double homicide case in Ózd, according to a reasonable suspicion, helped to eliminate the crime, said on Tuesday spokesperson of the Chief Police Directorate of Borsod.
Persons with suspected activity have suffered and are currently being charged with helping the crime.
Both minors, according to MTI, two girls are being hunted for freedom.
The assistance of the crime shall be punishable by the release of liberty for up to 5 years.
Suspected of double homicide in Ózduz, 23 years old male here, was taken to provisional custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a criminal offence scheduled for multiple murders for human consumption.
During the investigation it turned out that a 23-year-old young man owed a 53-year-old man a greater amount.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so his creditor lured his last Wednesday into one facility in Odz, where he killed the first man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was pre-prepared to commit a crime, indicating that he killed a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
The gun and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for buying a hundred percent share of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party even though the Czech authorities had already ruled out the Russian stock exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is a state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As Czech economic daily E15 writes, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount offered to the participants for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech papers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Vienna Stock Exchange, and Deutsche Börse have been offered, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that in the future this would lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange estimates stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold out.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance's investment bank with about 25 % share followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r. with 13.5 percent.
About the financial crisis from the perspective of the European leaves
In their Tuesday comments dedicated to the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European lists already resemble the second September 11th.
We can thank the U.S. President for the global financial disaster, raise the charges of Roman La Repubblica. The President was not even able or able to sew his own party to support that rapidly paid draft law, the aim of which is to remedy this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about the second September 11th.
Some of the Madrid press also see the guilty man in Washington.
In the opinion of the daily El Mundo, the global economy has led to the collapse of the lack of political leadership.
The danger of collapse of the US financial system is constantly growing, for which the world will ultimately pay.
While Bush's plan was not perfect, after the Congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political instrument to solve the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just when one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be forgotten, points out the female daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states may so far place a life-saving circle on top of financial institutions, and taxpayers can save them from the crash.
However, if another bank is to collapse as cubes, there will be no more money, no more improvisation.
In the long-term perspective, the Member States of the European Union need to move over their national selfishness and unite control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, money institutions received more than 100 billion euros, reminding the Vienna Der Standard, according to which they are concerned that, like Americans, they will have to go deep into the pocket and European taxpayers, increasingly real.
The European Union has been dealing with a crisis that has not yet been seriously addressed as the people of the old continent.
Rescuers need not have EUR stamilliards immediately, but it would be good if they fixed themselves firmly in which case it is reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money in order to avoid any more harm.
Smart car immitates years of noose
What would possibly be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions if not imitation detectors of obstacles occurring in the world of nature?
Like a bee.
The default strategic idea of a surprising project, presented at the CEATEC Japanese Fair, revealed to engineers from the company Nissan Čmelczeczów. It was about how to build a new generation of systems that prevent collisions.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan developed a biomimetic robotic management system of the BR23C type, a robotised miniiauto, which is equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate objective of helping to create a system that can eliminate all precipitation.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our security packaging," explained Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General of the brand for the field of technological PR and R & D.
An important role is played by composite eyes that enable bees to see in all directions at a visual angle of more than 300 degrees.
In order to copy the function of the complex eye, engineers reached the idea of a laser remote.
It identifies obstacles within up to 2 metres from BR23C in a 180-degree field, calculates their distance and sends the onboard microprocessor a signal that immediately transforms into an operation to prevent precipitation.
The obstacle is captured during a fraction of a second, then the robotized car starts to imitate the motions of the bees and turn the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision immediately changing the direction.
Unlike any existing system, this evasive maneuver is being conducted in an absolutely instinctive way.
"If not, the robot car could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and design of the robot car.
They must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology is compatible with the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety packaging, which is currently considered inevitable within.
The whole process has to reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than an eye stroke.
But unlike the bees, this movement cannot be directed upward, downward or angled, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction of which the wheels can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees, only the possibility of turning, acceleration and slowing was applied in the case of a robot car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have longer life than lithium-ion variants.
According to Andoa, an instinctive, intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process, the less storage of data.
This mechanism must process and respond only to several incoming signals per second.
There is no need for them to be preserved and reacted with intuitive logic, based on data from previous maneuvers, therefore he is constantly using only a memory of several few kilobytes.
He doesn't need a memory of a giga- or megabayt capacity.
This is the first step towards developing a technology for immediate avoidance, which, according to the Nissan estimate, could reach serially produced cars within 10 years.
Another possibility of using it may constitute a combination of a unit with satellite GPS navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the final target on the path of the lying obstacle.
Damn dear child already has a name.
The economic rescue package Act worth $700 billion to be divided into several instalments, which aims to buy out negative bank loans, already has a written form.
Half the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended on Saturday after midnight of American Eastern Time, representatives of Congress reached an agreement within days of a debate on a rescue package worth a total of $700 billion, the Reuters said.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the House of Representatives, according to which only the writing of the agreement remains.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The Minister of Finance, Henry Paulson, stated on the outcome of the compromise: "The programme will work and be effective, but further steps need to be taken."
The written appearance of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 o’clock in Washington’s time (now on Monday at two o’clock in Central European time), but no special increase in storms caused any.
The draft legal standard, which hears in the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act to be established, will be voted first on Monday by the Chamber of Representatives, then the Senate will be lined up.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then the report on the agreement was also welcomed in the White House.
"With the progress achieved at night, we are satisfied and we value both parties' efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," said the White House spokesperson Tony Fratto.
In fact, the programme differs from the original draft of Bush administration, in which it was meant to be a total of $700 billion for the purchase of quality securities secured by mortgages.
It is now possible to spend at the first time half of $700 billion in the first round, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after things are decided by Congress on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will buy the securities secured by mortgages that are assessed as ineffective, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special congregation, the member of which will also be the chairman of the federal reserve bank.
The second half of $700 billion will depend on the further decision of Congress.
The Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the Act: it may at the same time buy out bad loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, and other "food" loans.
The purchase may take place both directly and directly within the auction, by the competent representatives of the Ministry.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in the insurance scheme, in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with guarantees for a reason of concern, for which companies will pay the price corresponding to the amount of the damage expected.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system, totalling up to $700 billion, whether it is a large-scale purchase of bad funds, insurance or the prevention of a systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to implement the law immediately as soon as it is signed," he added.
The banks that got into trouble waiting for state aid may, on the contrary, count on the government to reduce their distance - which in the overseas slang is simply called "gold parachute".
In addition, these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The limitation basically means that if the Ministry is to purchase within the auction, a tax mark will be imposed on gold parachutes if the bank's fallen head of the bank is not sent straight to retirement.
In the event of direct buy-back of bad loans, the government will aggressively step up in order to ensure that the money for management is not exceeded.
It is necessary to add that the existing agreement on fallings does not change, the restriction concerns only new contracts, which should be another incentive to participate in the programme.
"One is the first case in American history, when legal restrictions on the remuneration of Directors will apply," said Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the State will have the right to acquire a share in banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since, as soon as the economy and, together with it, the protected bank are able to stand on its feet, they can also make money on this transaction.
The draft plan includes that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal setting out how the expected losses of the financial sector can be recovered from taxpayers.
Of course, there were also voices on both sides in connection with the doubt plan.
"This is not what American citizens have asked us, because the taxpayers' dollars will not protect us," said the Republican Congressman of California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Kaptur states that exactly those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street insisted on adopting the provision.
Industry prices continued to grow

Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing industry also slightly increased by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The biggest price increase took place in August 2008 in the fur sector and the footwear industry (2.8 percent), mainly due to an inter-monthly price increase in the cotton and sedation industry by 4.6 percent, respectively, of footwear production by 2.5 percent.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical materials caused a significant monthly price increase in the chemical and product production sector (1.6 percent).
The price reduction occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 percent), the production of electrical machines and apparatus (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum - in the woodworking sector (0.1 percent).
Prices in the field of paper production and publishing and tirskáren activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the processing industry, we measured a price increase of between 0,2 and 0,9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution industry, which has a heavy weight in domestic sales, the price increased by 0,3 percent in August, mainly by the continued effect of the officially determined increase in gas prices from 1 July.
In the twelfth month comparison of domestic sales in the manufacturing industry, prices increased most in the oil processing industry (32.4 percent).
In the co-operation industry it was possible to observe 13,2 %, in the area of the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products with a decisive weight, then 11 % increase in prices.
Price reductions occurred in textile and textile products manufacturing (2.5 percent) and electrical machines and appliances (0.3 percent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9,1 percent.
Overall, prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and distribution industry exceeded the prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.

Next year without a visa to the United States?
According to Kingy Göncz, there is a great hope that the Americko-Maďar Treaty on visa free contact would enter into force on 12 January, the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her view, "It is almost all that matters now, if an electronic road authorisation system, respectively, is built behind the sea in a timely manner."
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system would not be allowed to enter, but tourists would have to register before leaving.
The Hungarian diplomat's teacher has been continuing the negotiations in Washington since today.
He will meet with the Foreign Minister Condoleezou Rice, who will hand over the Central Cross with the Star of the Order for the merits of the Republic of Hungary and will hold talks with advisers for foreign policy of the presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for the bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, Presidential candidates of both the great American parties, agreed on Sunday to guarantee their support for the government package to save the bank worth $700 billion, but they are also politicians who demand the demos of the Minister of Finance.
After a multi-day marathon of Congress and Administration negotiations, early morning was announced on Sunday: a basic agreement on bank rescue was concluded.
The financial package, which aims to transform the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
As Obama, McCain is well referred to as the more appropriate candidate of both candidates who would have raised the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the freshest surveys at the same time as they got to the top of the economic question, Obama gained a certain advantage again and McCain’s head start started, which was secured after the Republican nomination of Sarah Palin for the post of Vice President.
Obama expressed the hope of a 700 billion package bill in Detroit at the election meeting on Sunday.
He stressed that the proposal contained passages relating to consumer protection, which it also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly... to your places, to your savings, to the whole industrial sector, to the stability of the entire economy risking danger," said the 35 thousand crowd.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about economics outdated.
McCain, in an interview provided by the ABC TV station, said: "All this will be a bit to say... but nothing is simply not a way."
As the Republican Senator stated, the draft includes the setting up of a committee supervising the Minister of Finance and a restriction on the stand-alone authority he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no more important role in dealings, he himself was in contrast with the minister in daily contact.
On Sunday, President Nancy Pelosi, said that the House of Representatives of the House will vote on the bill, perhaps on Monday.
Overview of the German Language Area
The right camp is intact, only the voters within it became more confident - so it analyses the weak outcome of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent red and black coalitions.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the left-wing German news magazine Franz Walter is discussing in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution eats its father" the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, the CSU era began a lot earlier than its office took over the sad duo Beckstein-Huber.
For decades, Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria - and these modern citizens are now turning away from them.
The period is a problem of all Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The debate was not quite surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday it ended a process that could have been assumed for almost exactly 10 years: an undisputed hegemony of one state-party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in elections to Bundestag in 2005, which is still mentioned so often in Stoiber's period.
This is due to the modernisation that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and which is devouring its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have been very mistaken at a pace. Self-arrangement, educational results, German settlement from the east and north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without the result of the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization is linked to the growth of possibilities, which also has visible political consequences.
The right camp is intact, but the voters within it became more self-aware, more critical, more headless.
It is also obvious that in recent weeks, the CSUs have given up the most of their classic civil spheres; people in free professions, professionals, seniors and higher education.
The support of the CSU has already been below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diapresse.com)
The June Vienna daily deals with the confused interpolitical situation arising from the Austrian elections in its article entitled "Who with whom? Presidents are held?"
The SPÖ wishes to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP announces the mixing of SPÖ into its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears to be open to all negotiations, the greens do not yet wish to speak in coalitions.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the chairmen did not let their cards look too much.
The President of SPÖ Werner Faymann confirmed that he wanted to deal with ÖVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is certainly possible - in some federal countries and in social partnership there is.
The question of whether he could imagine coalitions and Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As expressed, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted for each fall.
Repeating this direction is not an option.
Molterer responded cautiously to red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere with the internal affairs of ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses opposition or enters the coalition, it is still absolutely open, these questions need to be discussed inside ÖVP.
The President of BZÖ Jörg Haider appeared again open in all directions.
"To prevent oro-black coalition, we are prepared to take on government responsibility," Haider said.
Apples: You need to break the enchanted circle of poverty and Segregation
In Paris today the European Summit of Equality, which is hosting France, the current President of the European Union.
Liva Járóková, MEP of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the professional negotiations in her message addressed to the plenary, has turned attention to the segregation in education, as this is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children and, moreover, also, the most serious obstacle to their application.
On behalf of the French Presidency, Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the conference.
To negotiate, they sit between invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil associations acting in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the Euro MPs press office, Fidesz Jaróková pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in recruiting workforces, Roma are primarily forced out of the European labour market to blame their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma have no secondary education and, as a result of the poor quality of basic education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher level of education."
In addition, I note that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investments in early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member of Parliament, it is necessary to establish this link in the widest circles - between both Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner the Romani student starts school, the greater the chance to become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"Roma is the right of their European Union citizenship to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the removal of their inexpensive quality and separate education," said Lízia Járóková.
According to the Member State, the coherence of the European Union is needed, with a focus on the aim and negotiations, to speed up immediately the processes of deegregating schools, and this is of paramount importance to ensure that existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations are respected.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, Segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to provide the Roma children with the opportunities given by democratic space so that citizens can participate in the future of Europe," Járóková requested.
Everyone is in the sign of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities' guaranteed the objective of the European Summit of Equality, organised every year since last year in Berlin, to ensure a single forum to help achieve the goals of equality and to eliminate discrimination, set at European and national level.
CSU: Temporary Grace
The fate of the serving dua Huber-Beckstein shall be decided at the end of October.
Despite the shameful election debate, the debate on personal issues has not yet been the tops of the Bavarian CSU.
The President of the party, Erwin Huber, and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein, may still remain at their place, the question is when this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, who suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes, will decide the last October weekend of the extraordinary congress of the party.
In any case, members of a highly criticized dua have heard that they will not be invulnerable at all times.
They tried to calm down the angry members of the fraction and base, who, due to the loss of absolute majority, demanded the day after the 'Bavor Cunami' to produce personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber standing at the top of her career - received a Christian-social union of 60.7 percent, now, a year after the puck against Stoiber, but her strength was only 43.4 percent.
CSU has been in Bavaria producing 18 percent of German GDP "self" over 46 years.
While conservatives continue to have a key role for the Hungarian economy in the southern Federal Land, they will be forced to coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of reorganization inside the party is that a member of a narrow expert team, who will launch polls on possible coalitions of Munich government with liberal FDP, and with the right-oriented group of Free voters, will also be Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible Huber successor.
It is the irony of fate that Gabriel Pauli, who was used by the duo Huber-Beckstein to perform a puck, came to the candidate of the Free voters, then made an unlovable short trial with an ambitious municipal policy.
The leaders of the CSU now focus all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transitional period, the active role of Stoiber will also be played, who has so far done the threads of the background, the former prime minister of the Earth, and the former chairman of the CSU, called on September 28, the most difficult day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber scoffed several bitter remarks on the address of the CDU, according to him, they would have earned much more support from the sister side.
The other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for both the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become a Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in national success in 2005, somehow will not stand up together.
According to Merkel, which, because of the fiasco, was hard to hide from her disappointment, would not have a negative impact on the Berlin High Coalition position.
Which is, of course, relative: treating the CSU in the morning will not be easier, and the social democrat crisis continues.
SPD reached 18.6 percent of the weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko:position - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, not a single opposition MP came to the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained by Russian observers of prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) of illegality at the time of counting the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise elections.
Although the 110 members of the 10 million-millionth country legislative council has been lacking in opposition for a good ten years, the opposition associated with the United Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday's elections really hoped that Lukashenko, who had, on the basis of a change in the Constitution in the elections with the debate process in 2006 and the fourth, restored its presidential mandate, will now "adopted" to appear in Parliament, to several opposition Members.
ODS has also abandoned the boycott before it has been considered.
In the background of the opposition expectations, it was that in Russia, more and more dependent Belarus - which, at the ease of the impact of the constantly murdering Russian gas imports, took the credit and contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, the owners of gas pipelines passing through the countries, were given to Russia - wished to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political establishment, rated as anti-democratic Lukashenko, and other highly political parties, did not receive an entry permit.
The release earlier pointed out that the OBSE stressed positive shifts in the evaluation of the electoral campaign and not shortcomings - for example, the ban on a third of the opposition candidates.
But Monday's lightning report had already had reservations for the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not essentially appear in the press, especially to the fact that the opposition cannot be present.
At the same time, only improvement can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released to freedom and Minsk is willing to go with Moscow even to minor confrontations when they continue to refuse to recognise from Georgia the stolen South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Belarus is forming a country in the country of Belarus, considers these two territories to be independent for a month now.
"We took two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that he began dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said our letter Alexander Millinevich.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to remain so, even though "the only member of the opposition has powered to put into a small parliament".
In view of the results of the opposition, protest actions are not planned, rather trying to deliver their message to voters about the necessity of economic reforms.
"With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, opposition lists we need to print in Russia, distribution puts obstacles to local authorities, but I see that change supports more and more people, even older people," said Milinkevič, referring to the fact that Lukashenko's regime, which considers it his greatest success to be the creation of social security, does not consider the right or officially most supported layer of pensioners.
"For the debt of the country and the growth of the trade deficit is only a matter of time when the social security of the 'inducing silence of the cemetery' collapses," says Milinkovič.
Unlike the opposition policy, Russian elections were assessed as democratic.
Head of Mission of the Community of Independent States Sergei Lebeděv of the Russian intelligence agency Ria Novosti said that "people do not believe words, but acts," so absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the matureness of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now breakfast before work"
It's the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace, which was introduced by a rotating door when the arrival and departure of the employees.
However, from now on, this new measure will start against the people bound by them, against the ones who are gonna inject themselves and then go to coffee at work.
The new anti-locus debate was presented today as Minister for Public Administration, Renata Brunetta, and Secretary General of the Presidential Council of Maura Masi.
"Burst door - says Brunetta – is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presentation and more services" explains the Minister.
"Now will open a new period of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism", points out Brunett.
We will complete the introduction in all buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view".
On the part of the staff there were no objections, says the Secretary General: "It was the joint procedure with the staff and the cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast at work time; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning."
During one conference at the Higher Education School for Public Administration
In Rome, the Minister will finally announce that during three months the absence of public workers for illness has decreased by 50%, which means 60,000 more people a year at work".
And it adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
" their pay dynamics – explains the Minister – doubled in the last 8-10 years due to private sector and is much higher than the inflation rate".
In the meantime, thousands of public staff have gathered to reject Brunett's Decree in accordance with the Codacons request.
"While the Minister for Public Administration today will introduce ciphers regarding lower absence of work for disease," writes consumer protection associations – the nation of 'pilentiles' – is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration who have gathered together to declare war on unfair standards contained in the decree."
At Tara, it will protest primarily against the exclusion of fees on a sick person who depends on activity; the extension of the time at which the sick can be checked in which time limits will be carried out, and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Job injuries, Napolitano: "Resolate prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 work accidents will occur, three people will die, and twenty-seven will remain permanent disabled.
Inail levels confirm that in 2007 we have approximately 1.200 deaths due to accidents.
These figures testify to the severity of a conviction that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice the death rate compared to the murders.
To reinvigorate the attention of institutions, social and information funds on this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating today in all Italian regions the 58th national day of the victim of accidents set out on the second Sunday in October.
"The alarming date extended by Anmile and the same tragic reports of these days confirm the importance of labour security", confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in the report sent to President Anmila, the National Association for the Frozen and Invalidity for work, Pietro Merccandel.
The head of the State expresses its continuing admiration of the continued joint efforts to ensure safety at work, to protect wounded workers, to help the families of the victims and to participate in public opinion."
"The naturality has been raised by the angry 'dness', frankly shared in the face of the tragedy, which in its scope trigger a start in the media and participation of public opinion, but the everyday reality once again offers us dramatic cases, even repetitive in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives put forward in the field of education are of particular importance, so that young people who face the world of work gain clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its disturbing social severity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The president of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed on his part "as the death result of the accident creates an absolutely critical social state, as insults the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make convincing efforts towards the necessary termination of this situation."
"In terms of labour impact data, it seems that some positive turnover appears, but it does not deny that the number of deaths due to accidents is as alarming as it is", said President Anmila Pietro Merchandelli.
"We wouldn't want this "reduction effort" to lead to less attention, because right now, when the attention stops, there will be a tragedy.
"We believe that in general too little is being done to stop the accident problem and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion, to emphasise Merccandeli – to increase control and inspection, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers, immediately from school age".
"There is still a need for further effort - he added – in terms of communication and public opinion.
But more sense of responsibility is needed for employers' responsibility to the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon."
In the end, Mercandelli stated that it was a progressive degeneration of the right level of compensation for the working victims and a "contribution of supportive care" to which the system has reached in recent years."
"The aim of this is to give the worker back the insurance guarantee - he added – because the fate of those who harm themselves must not depend on spontaneousity or giving time to the legislator."
Players of Mp3 accused, present hearing at risk
Listening for a longer time with loud music and using portable music devices as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to the European Commission's publication today, which in one official report extended in Brussels quotes the opinion of the European Commission's Committee on Health Risks which have recently arisen and been identified (Csseri) Eu.
"From this scientific point of view, we read notes that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years by means of portable music instruments, more than an hour per week and maintain a device for high volume, risk the permanent loss of hearing skills."
"It worries me that so many young people who use portable music devices and mobile phones at high sound levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an incorrigible way", admits Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings, the Head continues – there is a clear risk and there is a need to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to stimulate the consumer and publish this information.
We need to continue to review the existing control systems in the light of this scientific findings, so that they are fully effective and that they keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Knowledges – concluded by executive official Eu – confirm that it is necessary to worry, and now the European Commission will examine together with other members and parties who have raised the problem, what measures would be possible to eventually implement and thus better protect children and young people from exposure to noise, the originator of which are portable musical instruments and similar equipment".
There is now a safety European standard, which limits noise level of portable music instruments to 100 dB, but raises concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by excessive exposure of similar noise forms.
It is very possible to limit these damage by looking for solutions as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure.
In his belief, the Scientific Committee of Eu states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, exceed the currently valid limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risk a permanent loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should include 5-10% of users of such devices and their amount can be estimated between 2.5 and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alejandro will leave the Commission free course for the future of the capital
Today we start, we close in March, we'll have the sum in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to workers of the "Commission for the Future of the City of Rome" who met in his new mansion this morning behind the Caracall spas.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and another 49 members of the committee will draw up a hand for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will assess the analysis and projects so that they can present in June a strategic plan for Rome with the "official result" of Campidoglia and its councilman Gianni Alimann.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas – it wants to emphasise Alemanno – it will have to make proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually apply the political decision-makers left by Giunta e General Council.
It is not an exchange of functions, but it is only about trying to have a place to process a big project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then dissolved, because this institution must have an accurate time limit.
In June – he announces the mayor – we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome".
To him who accuses the Commission of unnecessaryness since his opinion will not be binding, Almanno will say: "All depends on the work which the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of quality, as will the proposals of the Attali Commission, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Policy is being paid too often on daily issues and on the urgency that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to emphasise that "this Commission is neither a useless business nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, the Roman citizens will not stand up for the euro and will serve to think and involve the best intelligence the capital has."
For Alemann, essentially, "it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither definitive nor immobilizing, in order to allow our city to rise authenticly at the level that it needs and think with a united spirit for its future."
The future, which explains the mayor of Rome's "will not be limited to the current municipal border, but will look much further" not only in the hope of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of the capital but also "the role that Rome can and must exercise as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
One famous American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who deciphered the economy of the US and maintained relations (as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam".
The attacks against Obama grow right when the election date approaches.
One Miami lady wrote on the web: "This man is full of ambitions.
Obama has a hardness: he thinks he will reach the highest post of the nation, which has all had two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these attacks do not say much," they are attacks of clearly racial origin and do not answer the question of voters: will they be a good president? And then we have surveys; they all say that Obama will win and with a great lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the slaughter of the south of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the election booth we know well who will give his voice to the American patriot.
There will be a page on American mentality, which remains high until the last moment.
Say what you want, we'll take care of it ourselves, who to strangle, whether Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: If Obama was to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been spoken before, it seems almost certain the success of a black candidate.
But despite all these considerations for Democrats, George Bush's main weapon is.
They asked 1500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent responded: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and sent him home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have saved lives and Americans have not been forced to pack up.
And yet Iraq has become for most of Bush's weaknesses.
Who will join Georgie W will have to do a huge task.
The U.S. economic collapses were felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers, and many blame the internet, "killer" press.
The EPW Research Center asked five hundred journalists for their profession and provided for the future.
Well, today almost all the pessimistic journalists are today about their future.
However, they did not openly say that they have less concern about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to be.
The problem is the money for American journalists, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis in 2008 is the crisis of the destroyed economic model.
Besides, cuts made in newsrooms, in a room where editors work to put together newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists in question, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalistism to change substantially as the general public understands it.
The American journalist is making a clear, but complex pessimism.
Six of the ten press journalists and executive seniors are convinced that the newspaper is on a national scale misguided path.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
It's been printed against Broadcast.
It's hard for journalists to see where the website is going.
Most publishers take their way to the Internet, which many look at as "killer" print.
The "economic pressure" highlighted by journalists increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists who were asked admitted that they were evading technology in the hope that for their newspaper "doing something good".
The biggest gap in American journalistism is among those driving newsrooms – that means leaders – and reporters working for them.
56% of national leaders are sure that their reporters share their values while at local level they fall to 23%.
This has something to do with "security of work".
Leaders who think they lose their job within three years are 47% at national level.
With regard to journalists, they're at 30%.
As for "certain work" related to staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still in daily order.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In such a huge nation as Usa, with three hundred millions of people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, tv and Internet employers often offer what they want, and so the question is to take or leave them.
Leaders receive almost always huge wages and the editor can make $100,000 a month out of salary and insurance.
As regards allowed, the arguments are complicated: a number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after a third year to reach fifteen days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick over a year.
It's just a climate issue.
UNIPOL: SOUND IN THE OLD, DANILO COPPOL SUBJECT TO GROUP
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of Rome, Carmelo Rinauda, decided to reject the submission of a businessman with the realities of Daniel Coppola, who asked for him to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the counter-procurement sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During his own cost process he received last week's release from home prison, which was converted into forced permanent stay in Grottaferrata.
His attorneys, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a real estate entrepreneur be allowed to change his place of stay from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this movement (by whom Pm) would allow him to influence his company and to get to the evidence that they are accusing him.
Elites in danger
This phenomenon was demonstrated several days ago when Komora voted against the rescue plan to provide $700 billion to the White House: a large part of the Americans were more interested and interested in the punishment of Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by last night's New York Times, which inform us that the current crisis divides the Republican side, increasingly divided between its old soul East Coast, milder, meeting federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which is rather conservative, hostile to the Washington world of finance, strong in the middle and south.
A soul who arrogantly showed up with a vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, this very quoted thing is just an example of changes, major changes that have already shown the current economic earthquake: not only in the United States, but in the whole of the West and perhaps not just here.
As in Usa, in Europe this crisis seems to be acting as an accelerant of phenomena that have been incubating for a long time in the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the reformation, exceptional recovery of the market, the double category of State power in relation to a certain renationalisation of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis in the banking of financial institutions, which obviously have strong ties abroad, but in which the budgets of people and families living in a single country are mainly included in a single country.
This has also created a political problem for those driving him: that means how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families, including voters.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be substantially out of play or having nothing to add: clear proof has given the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot decide for one common policy line.
So everyone is waiting to intervene with the government of each individual state, rescue plans, recovery of the market, new rules and mainly distribution of funds: when we get to pressure, only the states have economic resources, the amount of financial resources, to try to put everything in order.
And it also has its own means and powers to use them: two sources of enormous value, under certain circumstances that perhaps no market and no international organisation will ever be able to have to have to do so.
This new empheze, which the crisis imposes on a state-national element, is, in fact, in complete consistency with the growing importance that attempts the latest economic progress to bring about a single factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of the site, the ever sophisticated technologies, essential, while we believed that global finances had already been destined to rule the world, out of nowhere we realized that our future would have to deal with such few non-material things as water, grain, oil.
All things that would have been said may move from one place to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to a bordered area, to the territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler has much more cards in his sleeve than whoever is not and who has the bad luck to live in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I'm getting to the second news, but it's a break.
Who talks about territories, the state, the government, inevitably talking about politics, namely leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two controversial phenomena appear to be formed.
On the one hand, knowing that it is objectively needed by authoritative leadership, an application for someone who could take the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discreditation towards existing leadership, especially economic, which appeared to be equally unattractive and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: discredit, impatience, incompetence and absence, which try to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems that it is increasing in broad masses of belief, rather than being the same as the ideas of yet popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that elites have already exceeded their time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership only feeds one branch on the ground, but the strong movement to remove ruling classes and traditional political arrangements is reflected in the sudden elections» or in the unexpected changes in collective moods in the last and most recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the fall of the Labourists in the UK, towards the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps has something to do with the victory of the right in Italy).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremony, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have more and more problems understand, so represent, which, not from today, are formed in the deep layers of Western companies and that the economic crisis is strengthening again, expanding, potentially overflowing.
Before this, it would be exaggerated to speak of permanent mass rebellion».
But I'm sure we can't say it means having our eyes open.
Super glue to walk through walls
Overcoming the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk through walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centres, and now the team of four institutes has very close to it.
Scientists have managed to keep the stokilogram body glued to a vertical wall using a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science published discoveries of some of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology and Air Force Research.
The material that a team of researchers invented is the development of materials already existing, which use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf pipe.
“The complex of glues can be seen as a series of pipes consisting of a set pile of spaghetti”, explains Zhongshan Lin Wang from the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by gecko legs, covered by microscopic peels that allow the animals to provide a perfect helmet.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, showed that the new glue is ten times stronger than the legs of these laps and at the same time" will simply bounce from the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Engineering of Dayton University.
WHAT ABOUT ZDECH? -"This material could be useful as a visual glue» will add Liming Dai.
Like Spiderman, perhaps, but researchers think of much less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because the dwarf carbon pipes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could apply to air space engineering.
For now, no super heroes.
OTHER RESEARCH – Also University in Berkley, California, is researching a new glue.
In one article of the magazine American Chemical Society, California scientists presented glue moulded from micro fibers as hair, which clean themselves from dust by moving to the surface to keep it perfect.
Medicines: never with juice
Watch out for the sodium, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some life-saving medicines, their use is changing by increasing or reducing their effectiveness with serious health consequences.
To David Bailey, the professor of Western Ontario University in London stressed the risks of juices both prepared and fresh in combination with the use of some medicines, to the currently ongoing 263. National meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia causes new alarms: one glass of nerves, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, to cancel their beneficial effects and to put patients' health at risk.
The Grep juice has already been accused of increasing to the toxic level of effects of certain anti-arrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
BEARS IN RIZIK– The Italian medical agency itself announced this in the information bulletin two years ago and extruded doctors and patients in order not to appreciate the dangers arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they take medicines, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NEJEN GRAPEFRUT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that reduce drugs.
Long list of effects with grapefruit and other juices.
From here on, Michele Carruba, Director of the Faculty of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan:"A number of such discoveries are reported immediately to various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for drugs.
So always read the illustrative tickets of drugs you get and if you find something vague, don't worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification» highlighted an expert for Ansa.
Nobel for Paul Krugman's economy
Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokeňan who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics in terms of foreign, economic and political steps of Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks in September 2001, the days that Enron, Krugman predicted in one comment published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of the consequences of the history of the United States, more important than the first.
The prediction that caused the polemics was lacking, and which for years had been read out to him, but proved to be accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked, with what speed collapses such as Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from the public interest, Krugman declared at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is "a great deal of significance", but also a popularist who has "very aggressive style, particularly critical against Bush's excesses of liberalist administration".
Open Office, we have the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft»
It is the day of issue of Open Office.org 3.0, the open source package of personal production, which is directed towards becoming more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to a more famous Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work of voluntary workers controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows the general public with various news: to welcome the screen and to revised and improved window opening, another far more significant, as compatibility for Apple Mac OS X and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version ISO.
Also put them on cooperation with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open a document as well as a new Microsoft file extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
There are interesting features of some models such as what allows to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility to transfer PDF component into the graphic design model and preserve the original look of the site.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrids" documents that look like typical Adobe graphics and have the properties of a table processor or text program.
Cooperation is an element that has gained many improvements within application programs: it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts in changes, in the text program each co-worker is assigned a single color to comments to make it clearer to identify in the revision phase.
Some companies also work to transfer some Open Office functions to Web (on the cloud) and in the following weeks they should change the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded to http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, it has been added to the English version, which has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also the installation cd can be sent home or at the workplace at the request.
And if the issue of freedom can be a drive to spread in households, it is the business area of the Open Office a package of lots of stakes and can already count on the various projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And neither does the training, consultation and assist services that are ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that aims for Excel replacement; Impress for presentations similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, after all, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that by today we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of a new version it is possible that this figure can be overcome.
Also the results of Kohl are positive, it is the fourth case of doping
New positive case at the last Tour de France: It's Rakušan Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classed and winner of the top top shirt.
The report quoted the pages of L'Equipe's diary.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive for Ceru, Epo of the third generation, after Italians Riccardo and Leonard Piepol and the Germans Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The results of the blood samples Kohl fall into those that have been performed in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabra labs.
If the control analysis confirms the positiveness of Ceru, Rakušan will lose third place on Tour and have to face the two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl's positiveness at the third generation confirms the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already informed about the outcome of the Austrian government.
The 26-year-old Rakušan was placed on the stage winners behind Spain by Carlos Sastr and American Cadel Evans, he also won the shot T-shirt of the best vrchar.
IMIGRANTI:NEW THE YORK TIMES IS ITALIED OF RASIST?
Italy "as a country of migrants, only in the last house has transformed into the preferred target of immigrants" adopted with opposition.
The New York Times, which dedicated this article to the debate on racism in Italy, began in the case of young Abdul William Guibre originating in Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan because he stole a box of biscuits.
This case makes it possible to define what the New York Times defines as the North Paradox: Northern areas are also those that register "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant thinking in the country and the strongest support of the North League".
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NTY quotes the intensity cases of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
Also, the new legislation required by the Legou, which seeks to hinder immigration and facilitate the smoothification of illegal immigrants, is quoted as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The tendency highlighted by both the pope and the president of the Republic: "Georgio Napolitano, after he met Benedette XVI in Quirinale, asked that the state and the church work together at the slaughter of racism".
Students with expensive rents - up to €900 per room
The rental market for university students doesn't know the crisis.
According to the latest studies by Sunia, the tenant unions, a single room can be rented by a student in Milan up to EUR 900, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"Jev has already achieved such proportions that the entire layers of students have lost their right to study because of the total price too high that their families would have had to endure – explains the head office for Sunia, Laura Mariani – in this city, the large demand from students has deformed the market in such a way that it has stimulated the price increase that has spread to residences".
In most cases, rental offers contain several breaks: contracts free of charge, unregistered, without a limited hire, with the associated loans.
For Sunji, an exceptional intervention is needed to regulate prices thanks to the tax revision.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in Brianza, there is a need for a single bed of about €450, per single room is valid from the minimum price 650 (Bande Nere zone) over the average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fier) up to the maximum 900 (in Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed is on average EUR 350/400, one room of about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones near the university, 250/280 Euro per bed in a double room is required, from 370 to 500 in a single bed.
In Rome in central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) want about 600 euros per single room, 450 beds in double bed.
Values are a little lower (550 Euro per single unit) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: EUR 300 per bed and 450 per single room area of Prenestin, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples, 300/450 Euros are required, per room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want EUR 250/350 in bed, at least 350 per single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is rented for students from countries outside the European Union, one more anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of approximately 25-30% of the fee they want for foreign students compared to Italian students.
Good-bye to the old cinema of Paradise, the city is breaking historic halls
The Kinematographic historical halls are closing in favour of Multiplex.
"A town without a movie is like a blind person, like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giusepp Tornator successfully records what is happening in large Italian city centers, but also rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multivalves in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of monosalms in the central zones of cities, is one of events that seem to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the characteristics of real cultural crime.
There are often historical sites that are charged with memories," it is like we lose a friend, a friend, who we shared a piece of road and a lot of emotions», the director of the new Paradise cinema, a movie that won Tornator Oscar 20 years ago and a great prize of the jury in Cannes, who spoke about the poetry of one village cinema and sorrow due to the way of life that probably lost the cinema forever.
The values gained by Anec, the main association of operators, are clear: during the last five years the doors of the traditional tip closed, and the highest account paid mostly for halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, about 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, by 6 less in Torín, by 5 in Palerm.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna in the first place with a loss of 82 cinema halls followed by Toscank (44) and Lombardia (41).
And by proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the arrival of a multiplex, these three Italian regions, which have registered the highest number of new cinemas: 195 canvases more in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
“Italian procedure has evolved unreasonably”, claims Paolo Protti, President Anec,” it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the already existing ones survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let's not mention the lack of funding for the benefit of operators: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is disgraced that the government does not respect existing laws.
In support of the sector, between 16 and 18 million euro per year would be required.’
An interesting case is the bolognian case, the first Italian city to be concerned with the closures, which decided to find the starting point by signing the protokull between municipalities and Anec, the first such type in Italy for the protection and promotion of small cinemas both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
The planned standards include the steps of tax relief for operators and the benefits for audiences in terms of mobility: the audience will be able to enter the zone with limited transport and will have special prices to stop and to some parks.
«I like this initiative» says Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope other cities follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, in order to be able to stand against the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of the sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the conclusion of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adulthood, was a spark that convinced me to establish the New Cinema Paradise, which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I am passing before already closed Rialt or Quirinal in Nazionale street, where I have shared so much emotion that I may not have to look at the inscriptions blackly with dust, I will turn on the other side».
The link between politics and the Mafia 'ndrangheta' group, Mayor of Gioie Tauro in Prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to modify the election of the City Office according to the interest of the Mafian group Piromalli".
The accusations brought against the Mayor and Vice Mayor Gioie Tauro Giorgi gave Torrone e Rosari Schiavon, and Mayor Rosarna Carl Martelli, trapped this morning because of external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are difficult.
In the irons also Gioacchin Piromalli, an old middleman between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, named boss, who has already been accused of committing the crimes of the mafia, sentenced to the payment of EUR 10 million.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards as well as common sense," writes state representatives when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay counsel to Piromalli.
"So the Mafia Group would allow – the Czech Judges – officially join the city authorities and make it easier to control and manage public administration."
The president of the Kalabrian Regional Commission of Agazio Loiero does not hide that "the secret agreements between local institutions and organised criminal sub-divisions are much in his country: "There are areas where the focus of the mafia is stronger than in others, where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndrangeths, heroes who are still undisciplined'.
The prisons from this morning follow after the prison last July, which the police showed that the Piromalli Group was given a final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the City Council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was also the expected link between organised crime and local administration - were local politicians deprived of office in municipal administration.
Giorgio Da Torrone, the chairman of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of dissolution was elected the head of the coalition of the right center after the closer election in May.
He screamed for scandal when Prefectura ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called for responsibility to the Deputy Minister of Interior Marc Minniti and accused him that he had planted everything for political reasons, but judges in the Arrest Order signed this morning explained that the Mafia group had come even so far that she had asked for a change in the project of the A3 motorway.
From further interviews directed against Dal Torrrion, written by public prosecutors, "the willingness to move business demands, representatives of some larger groups very close, as is generally known, Piromalli and adapt the elections to the administration of public interest to the Mafia Group".
When energy comes from the waves, they enter the game with the greats.
It is an endless bearing that covers over 70% of the Earth’s surface and is now beginning to appear to be a large global energy company.
The waves, currents, tides, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the eyes of colosses such as Chevron, which now tries to draw hands on these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than 100 years and in the 1970s, in the context of the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went aside, but now the organic organization and the new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new impetus.
World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 declared that around 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of wave waves of the sea.
This amount would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centres.
Besides, there are currents and tides and tides.
Giants are attacking.
The company, which was based on marine energy, was Enersis, which agreed to build facilities in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on sea energy, there are more and more companies that rely on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – he has spoken to a spokesperson of one company that is connected to the United States oil colossal in the economic daily Wall Street Journal newspaper – and thinks about the possibility to work with us."
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for launching a project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
This signal cannot be underestimated, especially if we consider that the oil continues to grow in Alaska, and President Bush recently came up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, they follow the trace of marine energy and Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the totals invested so far, even though they are not well known, they show an increasing interest according to observers.
Technology, you need to work out the key.
Experts are talking about technology that's still at first, because they don't know what impact the marine energy will have on the environment.
Meanwhile, equipment in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensiones and it does not seem to cause major ecosystem problems.
However, more energy-producing technologies need to be used with a greater impact on the Proliferation.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses the system of fear that are connected to one another.
The force of the wave that moves with the fights up and down is changed by means of cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these fights.
The pressure melts the turbine that adds energy to the generator.
Energy's getting hit by underwater cables.
So far, there are four devices of this type in the project phase that are waiting for federal approval, and part of the energy could serve for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is already producing energy for the shopping centre and parking lot using six bird turbines in the New York East River.
The movement of water during the tide and the tide causes rotation of turbines, which this turning motion is a live generator.
Verdant stated that they had a long list of clients who were waiting for the necessary authorisation due to the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, along the tide and along the tide.
Special interest at this point deserves the potential of influx and discharge, says at the Institute for Electric Research.
Although this is an independent factor, the tide and the tide are more predictable than the wind, the sun or the waves, and thus as reliable as the energy source.
Just into the energy of the tide and tide of states like New York, Maine and Alaska, and with other coastal states already invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and predicted investment of up to $35 million for 2009.
