Civil Rights Movement has issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Privilege of Coloring People (NAACP) published a warning for colored people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the discriminatory principles of the state and racist attacks.
"NAACP's travel advice for Missouri, with effect from August 28, 2017, calls on African passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to ensure increased attention as a result of a series of contested racially motivated incidents that are currently taking place throughout the country," says the Association.
NAAACP stated that this step was taken on the basis of the current laws of the State of Missouri, which made it difficult to defend racistly motivated acts before the court, as well as the conduct of criminal proceedings which disproportionately target minorities.
‘There is a violation of civil rights.
People are only stopped by police officers because of their skin color, are attacked or killed," said Kansas City Star President NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We still suffer the greatest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind, which the organisation has issued for the United States.
Among the incidents the organization quoted were racially motivated doses directed towards the students of black skins at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, the black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances at the beginning of this year after gas came across the state and the police thrown him into custody without charges of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to the recent statement from the State Supreme State of Missouri, which states that black skin drivers have a 75% higher chance of stopping the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to draw attention to people and warn their families, friends and co-workers before what might happen in Missouri," says Chapel.
"People must be prepared - they should carry money with them to pay bail or alert their relatives that they are planning to travel through the state."
According to the current figures of the FBI programme, hundreds of hate crimes occurred in Missouri in 2015, which makes the state 16th place among all states.
Travel alert is also responsible for the new Code of Missouri, which makes it difficult for companies to sue for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after states have approved an immigration law that allows state officials to hold people on the basis of a violation of this Act, which according to ACLU has improved racial profile.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but recently the Advisory Group has resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family isn't restless after 12 years!
The murdered is Sally Anne Bowman's model.
The girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by the chef Mark Dixi directly in the restaurant where she worked, and he planted stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex with each other, and then they killed her.
The killer was sitting in a nearby cafe and watching a thorough crime scene search job.
Dixie, former chef, was sentenced to 34 years in 2008 for the murder and rape of Sally's model.
He only admitted juvenile assault in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl dead on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie said Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had a fatal night fight.
The killer said, "He was really upset, and after his attack the girl started screaming."
"She finally attracted attention to the taxi driver," he said lying.
A girl, according to his statement, was to defend herself, as she could, in vain.
Lewis was supposed to knock her off the street.
Dixie's version was proved as a lie and accused him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his hornyness and his taste in a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light a marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was with his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol, and taking cocaine, he said that to Dexie himself.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put her hand over her mouth," she added the Mirror Linda.
And after 12 years, the family faces further attacks from vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people on freedom who dig up these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," said the Mirror mother of the late girl Linda about the disappearance of the urn with ash.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
The design vibrator costs tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are neither pruded nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague boutique Intimity.
In it you will find design and luxurious erotic aids.
Including the Czech designer Anna Mareš.
It started inconveniently, approximately 12 years ago.
Martin and his friends went on a cycling trip after Moravia.
One of them didn't just bring a bicycle, but also a box full of unobstructed observable vibrators.
"The different tailors and dolphins and all that was green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with a German designer erotic driver Fun Factory, which was an interest in Martin, and so he offered to help out with marketing.
When the companion left to serve another profession, he replaced him.
Today, in the Benedict Street of Prague, the Intimity, where it sells erotic aids in the way luxury handbags or shoes are normally offered.
And why wouldn't he?
It is also about design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, you think?
Come on, don't be such a puritan!
At the very moment, the Fun Factory celebration, which was proposed by the well-known designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the Intimity bust.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone here used to.
No hidden window windows, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exposed more like perfumery.
Martin and his business partner, Zdenek Šebelko, began to consider how to accept the Prague trade where it should be and what should be called.
The name Intimity liked both.
"It is ultimately related to intimacy and it is also, it can be said, tender," he says.
It followed the purchase of the internet domain and the search for suitable space, which went parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
Finally, it won the variant, which spread the shop into a garden of pleasure and bedroom, which is the bed.
Dagmar Štěpán from the FormaFatal studio made it to us.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem perfectly perfect, because he's not on the main street, but because of that, he was sitting with the name Intimity.
He's intimate.
He's in the alley next to the main one, so no customers are tempting," praises Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a business that would be different, with brandy goods, in an environment where women, which are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of the fact that they even entered such a trade.
When I walked into the Intimity's boutique half an hour ago, the streets broke empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I'd go to a store with erotic aids.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the clean elegance of the interior that I knew from fashion boutiques.
Even though there's only a woman's maid in the store, it doesn't mean that women don't get sick of asking for help, doesn't mean that a man's leg wouldn't be here.
Men come here to buy gifts for their friends.
"Mans can't usually estimate the right size and choose more," Martin smiles over a lot of mistakes.
These are the prejudices, the familiar clichés that women need some big aids, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith will choose maybe an unnecessary big vibrator.
Similarly, men choose mostly black underwear, while women generally tend to be pink.
The absolute best seller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
The expression in my face must be clear that I don't know which beats because Martin immediately explains how it works.
That's such a heartless clitoris stimulator.
Pere has become an adolescence in me, and the need to learn with admiration about what a serious tone tones is to give me interpretation.
It's like it's not getting mixed up.
And it doesn't actually feel bad.
It's worth a good price and has perfect user preferences.
We didn't think he'd be so well-accepted.
It's some kind of last revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the shape of a sea horse.
He has taken care of the fact that women have become more interested in the design of such products.
The other was a vibrator for we-Vibe pairs.
He completely degraded taboos that may persist in some men, and that in erotic aids he sees competition.
"There are various variations happening," continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
That's a favorite category.
By means of a love connection, a woman can have a vibration control in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibration.
On the contrary, a certain discharge is the category of pay-side vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women, they seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they only use it externally.
While in Western Europe, especially with younger customers, he's very popular.
What about men?
It's hard to say if a similar concept worked solely for men.
I think it's gonna have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin considers.
"And we have aids for them, but to a limited extent."The most is sold mainly by a Masturbator, in this case by the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn't look like anatomical resemblance of the vagina, but "slept like a shower gel or like an egg or a futuristic object.
They focus a lot on functionality and experience while using it.
It's completely different in Japan.
It makes me wonder.
I thought the Japanese would suffer a lot on erotic aid.
"That's the Internet reality," explained to me.
The daily one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with the use of women.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary they are taboo for women." Only for the interesting reasons - what the Japanese brand Tenga, represented in the Intimity boutique, sells worldwide, is still about half of what is sold in Japan only.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs aren't anything stupid.
On the contrary, we are indeed a noble nation.
Unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical store client is between 35 and 50 years and "has some experience, however, with sexual life, but with some assistance.
It will come for something nicer, better quality, to complete a partner life or for itself."To return, Martin Roz and his business partner, Zdenek Šebelka, are taking care of each product to make sure that it is perfectly functional.
Also, we don't want to get into the specials of Bonds and latex, because we don't have room for it, but it's not working out here.
Such things could discourage those we're trying to target.
Which are people who have always had the shame to go to sex shop because they were afraid to look at something like that.
Many of the products exposed on the cheeks are truly kissy.
It is also provided by the selection of renowned brands.
Some of them even gained design prices, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first prize was the said sea horse, and it triggered a change in the whole sector.
It began to run away from cheap materials and on the contrary to work with healthy non-hazardous, it began to produce other designs, different colors...
The nice thing is, behind some of them, is the Czech, but popular designer Anna Marešová.
I must say that I was quite surprised to see how many people here are buying those design things from Anna Mareš, although they are more expensive.
There are customers who go straight for Venushina's ball from Anna Mareš.
She did a really huge work by representing exactly what we are trying to present in both the Czech and foreign countries - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with the story.
Anna's story started out as a schoolwork.
Now it's a finished product that's also produced by us.
I wanted to have a process of production under control, and I also wanted to know what materials are made of and how Whoop.de.doo products are produced.
Because it's not a big deal, but a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a big series.
I may be going a little against the current, but it seems important to keep our development in the Czech Republic.
It could happen that we will not be able to produce anything in a few years," explains later Anna, who agrees with Martin that our company is increasingly opener.
The negative or refusal attitude does not apply.
I'm told that people are embarrassed.
"But even then they'll smile for you." Currently Anna Mareš has a vibrator on her offer, which you can get your personal message out of, and this year she's also planning her own lubricant gel.
In the next year, vibration eggs and other news should be taken.
The Border of Healthy Sex
I'm interested in where there's a line of what's right.
Is there anything that Martin Roz doesn't sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
Which one comes normal, another may seem totally abnormal, so we're defining a range of branding manufacturers.
None of them go into extremes.
Before we say good-bye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they got?
Right now, a week ago, an e-mail came in, in which some lady demanded a masturbation aid for her friend with 20 inches long.
Well, we had to write that down, unfortunately, we don't have anything like that.
It is still a question whether anyone has made fun of us," Martin points me to his suspicious view.
And that happens from time to time...
Roan for Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancer!
His friend Karel Štědý is struggling with serious illness.
The best friend of Karl Gotta fights diseases that steals people all memories.
"Yes, it's sadly true," confirmed the sad information by the singer himself.
I know about my illness, and I can handle it in the light of circumstances.
"I'm taking drugs that are supposed to slow the phenomena of the disease," he added with his thanks for the support.

He was able to return to work for the tennis court and ski slopes.
"From an astrologer I have been foretold to be here by 90," said Karel Lightning.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the song, so that I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
He is fighting the same disease now at the Institute and Actress Květa Fial.
Do you have a Alzheimer's patient in your family?
Look at how to treat him.
The Chinese Parliament has abolished an intervention ban, the law will judge the ÚS.
In Chile, the absolute prohibition on artificial interruptions of pregnancy is still pending, therefore, must not be done for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in Parliament for more than two years," said Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has 10 members and should, at the end of August, be given a new President, who, according to the AFP, is close to the opposition.
The law cancels an absolute ban on interference, initiated by President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on 19 July.
The rightful opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because it believed that it violates the right of an unborn child to live.
Members of the vote on the bill's proposal were postponed last month until the Joint Parliamentary Commission analysed it.
On the Wednesday, Members approved the proposal and that was what the Senate had done to them.
According to the new legislative regulation, there should be no criminal artificial interruption of pregnancy in three cases: if a woman is at risk of her life if a child does not have a chance of survival or if a pregnancy arises from rape.
Similar exceptions existed according to the Spanish letter El País in Chile since 1931, i.e. before women had been given electoral right in 1949.
The absolute ban on intervention in 1989 was introduced by the right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the President's office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where the absolute prohibition of intervention applies.
Others are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, there are now about 20 women in prison who are serving up to thirty-year prison sentences for interruptions of pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion that the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The object of Trump's White House is now the Svoboda statue
An unfamiliar sign of change of the regime is a statue critic.
The Americans could talk about it as well as everyone else - see carefully the instigated removal of Saddam Husajn statues at the Findados Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key advocates of Trump's regime, certainly knew what was going on when, in a passionate debate with reporter CNN Jim Acosta on the subject of presidential proposals on the drastic restriction of legal immigrants, he went out with a symbolic axe on Socha Freedom.
It's nice to say that Miller didn't attack a statue like that.
For that, he would be lynched by a crowd of shipowners and Socha Svoboda imitators.
However, he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903 a poster was placed on the podostek with the famous poem Emma Lazaras, up to 17 years after completion of the monument.
Miller told Acosta: “I don’t want to go into history here, but the statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
The poem that has been placed on the sub-assembly and which you refer is not part of it."
Miller's right, but as he said, this isn't about history.
It is especially the striking words of Emma Lazaras, who are resonating today – not only are immigrants invited, but the poorest of the poorest: “Let me be the one to go down, who is the poor, who can barely breathe freely, who can see the poor worm in the midst of the cities.”
And in modern times, we can watch these “poor worms” on our screens better than ever.
Miller wasn't trying to criticize poetry, and he wanted to make it clear that these people were not welcome in the US.
This conflict with the meaning of the statue is part of an extensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict of the meaning of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends who, after her death, sought to establish a poster with poems on the base of statues, knew quite well that they were letting themselves into a high political game.
The statue was supposed to express a connection to the French and American republican government by representing a classic topic, a female incarnation of freedom.
Emma Lazara changed this meaning: her poem does not include a female figure abstract but has its own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother of exiles.
The merger of poems with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way Emma Lazaraus changed the meaning of statues, right-wingists have long been trying to reverse that meaning.
A well-known commentator Rush Liaugh - Jan Baptizer in the events of Trump’s taking to power - in 2010 argued that Svoboda does not actually invite anyone into the country, but represents the early neo-constructionism, bringing the American flame to the remaining world: “The statue of Freedom is moving forward.
He's taking out a toll of freedom from the United States and offering it to the rest of the world.
The West is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States."
It's a very important thing to say, "Grazaugh" is a prodigy.
The meaning of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from a view of a exhausted and bloody passenger, who often after a long and scary cruise across the ocean comes with hope in the heart to the new country.
It is literally about looking at the world through the eyes of people looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue of hope expresses its need.
And, of course, that's the perspective Miller and Trump won't recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to cause hatred, which is their only source of power.
Athlettic World Championship 2017: Neil Black is a praise for Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when the British team had only two Scottish members.
The head of the UK's athletic Federation Neil Black said that a strong sketch of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be a “level contribution to the team”.
A record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for MS in London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that in Scotland something special is happening, and British athletes could learn from the Scottishs.
"We are trying to understand and adapt - we will work on it," Black said.
“I spoke to the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athletes: has something to do with what they've done.
People in the streets think so, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at the race at 5000 m while Eilidh Doyle was elected as team captain.
“ Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," said Black.
“ Some of the athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of a room with great pride and motivation.
The passion and unscrupulous feelings that Eilidh spoke to were unrepeatable."
A silver medalist Commonwealth, who will compete in the run through obstacles to 400 m on his fifth World Championship, said that he is “unbelievable” that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The runner in the middle line of Muir has only set five British and two European records in the last year.
The MS will participate in the run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who runs the track at 1500 m. This season won British team races and Annual Games.
Doyle remembers her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of Lee McConnell team.
The team captain has led them to be very proud of the fact that not only a large number of colleagues have come to the team but, in many cases, they will also attack their participation in the finals and medals.
“It was a great honor to me, but knowing that I was chosen by the team's members was pleased to do so” she added.
“ Obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that got on the team.
It shows where I've moved.
They're athletes who are going to think at the front of the stage.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I have only pointed out that we can be proud of this year's Championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and enjoy the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race, and I'm gonna enjoy an incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't look back for a public function unless you can handle voters' criticisms
Our country's father knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the papers did not take long to criticize him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending his political views.
Yes, this criticism didn't leave him cold.
But he wasn't trying to silence critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said: “The freedom of speech can be taken away from us, and we will be led like sheep to slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs work to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted at least 450 people who freely showed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, the U.S. Union for Civil Liberties sued him for the above actions.
The governor's employees rejected the action as a reasonable reason, and many views of the type of ‘who cares’ appeared on the internet.
"It's only Facebook," said many users.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, this is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It may boast the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not annoying.
As it is seen, its state manages with certainty its own and strictly adheres to the principles.
Turns out he's also skillful in using Facebook as the main means of connection with his voters - except for the first photo with a bare head after receiving chemotherapy.
Blocking people who close to the governor's side - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by his employees paid out of taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for the Washington Post Hogano spokesperson Amelia Chasse, the governor defended the blocking of comments from the position of the moderation of contributions.
However, using image of internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
Washington Post reported several real people who were deleted from contributions.
And that is exactly what they are - real people who speak to their elected leaders; a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comment by appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
An attorney from Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramaniová, Md. asked about hateful crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
“I politely noted that I am disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other current reports” wrote in the section commenting on the daily commentary of Washington Post.
"I do not like the idea that as soon as a number of people comment on the same subject, some people are referred to as promoting so-called collective efforts, instead of being recognized as a larger group of citizens involved."
What the governor's staff called "a concentrated spam interest" would probably call others "the defense".
Modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage contributions by blocking criticisms or delete negative comments.
It's much more comfortable than in the past, when the same procedure would require that employees be sent to the streets where they would collect and burn all the copies with criticism or arrest or silence the Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public agent to be criticized for dishonoring Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing an action by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
President Loudoun County Board of Supervisors has violated the first amendment in Alexandria, according to district judge James C. Cacherise, where she has prevented one of the voters' access to her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also received visits from ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In the days of Washington, the low price of the insured had practically the same effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily press was multiplied and its position as leader questioned many anonymous writers.
And even in those times Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under the alias "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to the newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by people in the context of the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were collected in his office that criticized his opinion on the Treaty of Amita, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he didn't shut them up.
Freedom of speech, disapproval and intimidation lie in the very foundations of our nation.
And the true leader must accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
In the Czech Republic, they use more of their tariff than at home.
The most often move in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season is Croatia.
On holiday, however, they have more time to poke on the web, and under umbrella most of them do not have the opportunity to join Wi-Fi.
Beach, bath, and smart phone in hand.
This looks typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of the local operators at home prices.
This results from fresh O2 statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data within the pashalal than at home.
Therefore, it is not surprising that during the winter, the minimum of our guests, during this summer season, data consumption has increased even 50 times.
Italy was then placed in the second place in the data consumption ladder.
Most of the minutes of the Czechs are called from Germany, where many of them go in labor and during the summer.
Croatia, according to the data of the Association of Czech Travel Offices, visited 800 000 Czechs annually, is our most popular holiday destination.
But people here have exchanged a book for sharing experiences with a mobile phone.
Record was this year's July 7th.
"There would be tens of millions of photos in the data transferred," said the details of the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslar.
Although Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users move in neighbouring countries.
Austria is firstly followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is up to the fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria for a walking and active holiday, which we do not have so much time to hack on the Internet.
"In addition, Austria is heading to the Adriatic," Cieslar explained.
While an operator recorded data after the release of roaming charges for high year-on-year growth, phone calls are much lower.
The number of minutes released in roaming has increased compared to last year to doubles.
Here Germany dominates with a huge lead in front of other countries.
"The roaming service uses corporate customers on the labour routes," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in her home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
The former Ronan Rafferty golfer will hope for the next three days in a cool atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th year Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finale according to Paul Eales. This year, he will perform the role of the Ambassador tournament as founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched Renaissance Club slowly grow in front of my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
“ Players will be able to love the first-class quality playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He's a keen advocate for this game and he's proud of his accomplishments.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
English Eagles will first defend the master's title despite winning the European Tour and European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I have a good feeling about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I had no chance to defend my victory at Extremadura Open, because a year after my victory the tournament was canceled.
The return to this part of the earth is magical.
It's a lovely golf spot.
I remember last year, when Sharon and my wife were going to win real power.
It was a beautiful time I won't forget."
Gary Orr is returning home to join the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from this year's country.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play home," said Orr about Helensburgh.
“You want to be successful and you feel a lot of pressure.
I really liked playing again, and I think I'm doing fine.
I am satisfied with the results of the past."
The three players will also join the former Masters Ian Woosnam winner and Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former captain of Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

The poor and death in the land of Indonesia of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, it's rarely used by a gentleman.
In its wooden hut located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in Papua, a woman usually throws sweet potatoes in the province of Indonesia - in the language of local “nota” - right into the fire.
After half an hour, take out the potato and taste it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on a muddish land - the cottage is not equipped with furniture - where he does his daily work, such as washing laundry in crowded water from nearby marshmallows.
The bucket in the room without the roof sucks the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no field of education was assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Work in late hours poses a danger: most men from the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In the village there are also soldiers.
“In the afternoon after 5:00, no one will be allowed to roam around the village,” says Bardin.
It is a rare view of everyday life in Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public uplift before the occupied army.
The current movement protesting the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the government of Jakart, which controlled the whole region, except for foreign journalists or civil rights overseers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua - an independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is so distant and devastated city, where you will reach after 90 minutes of flight from the capital of Jayapura Province to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach that takes a ride.
Gross traffic in this place isn't working.
The town consists of 19 000 inhabitants consisting of wooden cottages covered with bamboo fences, roofs of woold sheets in shades of grey and rusty colors.
There were very few Indonesians looking at this place, the author of journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the local Christians, they worshiped God named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing these dresses,” says Bardin, pointing to his colored, hand-worked turban, dark shirt and bright dress.
"We used to carry only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population live below the poverty line and here children's mortality and grammar is one of the worst in all of Asia.
At the same time, however, it is an Indonesian land of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world of Grassberg, which owns Freeport McMoran from American Phoeenix, is only 60 miles from Panai - rocky province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport brought gold and copper worth 3.1 billion dollars.
In addition, Papua supports wood mining at an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, this wealth is a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the mighty Indonesian army.
The investigation conducted in 2005 by the New York Times shows that Freeport paid local military officials and units some $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including the amount of $10,000 for one officer.
The popes who cry after self-rights threaten this gold goose and are therefore severely oppressed.
More than 500 000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, according to human rights activists, and thousands of others have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
The mass murders in the Papua Tribal Area during the 70th century have been compared to the genocide, as the Asian Human Rights Commission stated.
In the last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
In Will Lose Everythinging, a report by the Brisbane archcidiaze of 2016, describes the cruelty that occurred last year, as an out-of-court execution, torture - according to another report, the particularly popular rape and execution by electric current - and brutal suppression of peaceful protestors.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims, because incidents occur every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher of the Human Rights Watch organization.
The whole situation has aggravated the fact that Papuan resources are attracted to Indonesia by colonists.
Of 3.5 million inhabitants of this province, 83% report to Christianity, but demographics change with the tide of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatry and Sulawes.
Java canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado or blend vegetables with peanut sauce.
Locals are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants began selling chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuars," explains Abeth You, a 40-year-old who was born in Panai and moved to Jayapura Province for work in the capital.
“The original inhabitants of Papua - Mama-mama - have lost their jobs.”
In the context of his presidential campaign in 2014, the Indonesian President Yoko Widododo promised to address the inequality and violations of rights.
The former emperor has secured and en route to the President's Palace of the 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very few have changed in Papua, and local people feel hurt.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with hope to hear our calls for justice," said You.
The fact is that only two months after the October inauguration of Jake experienced great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles came out of the spring of the night.
Two of the surprised kids told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers touched the tone and later returned to four other soldiers, said the local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers were under pressure following a group of children, killing them with arms, putting in the hands of victims and witnesses of events.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so strongly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearest building of the electoral committee and then things got off the hook the next day.
Some 1000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football field outside the local police station and military headquarters and demanded justice.
They came up with ritual hunting gaps and made a dance vita - where the bird's song - the Papuan Mee Pago is running round and resembling.
Several Protestants started throwing stones at the building.
At least three times, when the crowd tries to resist, you have the permission to shoot," said TIME in the official document, whose contents were never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of Enarothali Kego Koto, identified the dangers and invited the inhabitants to spread to their homes.
However, no one was allowed to look at his words.
“When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist,” said the week TIME on the porch of his fine painted wooden house.
Kayame doesn't know who the shooter was yet, but according to his word, a bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"All around was a lot of people, and a lot of shots were fired," he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times according to his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
"I was going to the body to make sure it was really him," said TIME with a sad voice from Yohanes, who uses only one name as many Indonesians.
"I saw him dead... kissed him."
Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told the journalists that his officers only “supplied” the station that was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us to die," said Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's a question of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed, and many were faced with injuries.
The report on homicides went through both the media and the media on the following day.
Three weeks later, Jok had presented a passionate speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding for the families of the victims and promised to deal with violence in Papua.
"I demand immediate resolution of this problem so that it can never repeat itself," he said.
The Minister of National Security Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an extra-judged mechanism to resolve the violence that occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, the excuses began.
“ Most violent acts occurred a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be a simple task," he said.
In an interview of 5 June for the TIME weekly held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that it was not planning to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, they said that “all cases will be brought before the court.”
The belief that the UN accused of “the crimes against humanity” on the basis of more than one thousand dead during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor – said that 11 cases of human rights violations have been settled so far in Papua, including the Panai incident.
The families of the shooting victims in Paniai welcomed his claims of distrust.
“In the last three years I have been questioned four times, but I have not waited for anything,” Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid an army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many of the inhabitants of Paniai who were afraid to speak about the incident.
According to his words, he was beaten by members of the army after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After the body was buried, I started looking for the army," he said.
And the shooting doesn't stop yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
One person died and another 17 were injured, between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to provide assistance in the transport of a man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to the police statement, the villagers were throwing at their proper stones and the response was a warning shooting.
The locals, however, claim that the mobile brigade (Indian paralysitarian police) started shooting in the crowd and killing one person.
"The panic occurred, we were afraid of payback," said TIME 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
"I didn't leave the house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament was required to punish the police involved and download the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in central droughts.
Many of them joined the Movement for the liberation of Papua (OPM) - an army of rebels who protect the rights of the Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian policemen.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai, which belongs to not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Koja.
As a result of the attacks, the army has arrested and suspended thousands of inhabitants of Paniai in recent years, all under the pretext of "providing national sovereignty".
Some of them will never see again.
Paniai is known among the inhabitants of Papua as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Oil pours poverty into the fire.
The few rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is equally unattainable.
The local residents grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leaf vegetables.
There are women working on the fields; each one divides four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most harvests are intended for family needs, the rest sell on local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire has opened several routes, and new immigrants have started to flow to the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between the native Papuans and immigrants.
In general, so few jobs tend to provide more educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to get into business.
“You young people are moving out of the village because of a lack of job opportunities and money”, said John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Due to isolation, Papua province is hidden from the world.
The strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year two French journalists, French Escudio and Basel Longchamp, were released from Papua New Guinea, all because of the lack of cooperation with the authorities, despite the fact that they had received such a rare filming permit.
Phelim Kine, a representative of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised Jok in his election campaign to repeal strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development, but this never happened.
"The foreign journalists working in the most emerging areas of Papua and Western Papua are at great risk: visa recognition and inclusion on the black paper," he stated in his statement.
The lack of perpetuation reports from foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesia in Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific Nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of "a variety of and extended violence" in Papua, including the shooting in Panea.
These countries in the past have also supported OPM.
According to the journalists in Jakarta, Arrmanha Nasir, spokesperson of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, “The democratic system still applies, and the media are free, and it is difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations.”
Local people call after foreign governments participate.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands led by Kees Van Baarem's envoy, the local people visited Jayapura on May 4, according to the source that also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymously, the password “we want freedom”.
Another election is planned in Indonesia for 2019, but the popes say they won't vote for Jokik.
"Joku is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, Chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jok to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - except that they live in constant fear of the robbery army - are rolling in poverty, miserable education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Paniai, as well as the other Papuans, consider their vote "a debt" which must repay Jok.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite threats and intimidation of the families of the victims of the Panai shooting continue in the last symbolic act of rebellion: they bury the bodies of the victims on the property against the police and the military station.
Knowing that justice will never be done for enough, at least will not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"He was killed by a member of our family," said Yacobus with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy intercepted a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy has held a $1.46 million worth of cocaine in the Pacific yacht.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
During the intervention, a four-member crew of a ship was arrested, which apparently consists of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named as Afalina, came out of South America and the police pulled her to the port in Nouméa, the metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence service said that in cooperation with its international partners, it would seek to determine exactly where and where the drugs were headed and to reveal the 'liteva syndicate'.
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a great deal of drugs going to Australia," said its executive director Col Blanch.
Drugs were destroyed this week in Noumée.
Australia is an attractive destination for drug smugglers due to high street prices.
The country is also facing the problem of growing numbers of drug addicts.
The current raid is not the first ever.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large amounts of drugs from the United States to Australia, which tried to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean on a small plane.
The Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need a drink to be reminded.
The problem may be in senior homes, by solving doctors from Geriatric Clinics General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavla Mádla could be an infusion of a physiological solution that is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
But they only apply to medical devices.
The older one, the more water falls in his body.
"And it loses its sense of thirst, so the seniors generally accept less fluid and they dehydrate very quickly," said Mádlová.
Two liters should drink for sure.
"But getting so much fluid into an old man is a big problem," she added.
In senior homes, she thinks that no doctor is watching it.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually solved by infusions.
"I think that even there should be gradually introduced to receive subcutaneous infusion," she said.
It believes that the old people may be provided with up to two half-litre bottles of physiological solution.
A lack of fluid may cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration turns out to be a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day an old man says he can't get out of bed, talks confused," she added.
In case of neglect, it may cause up to a brain accident.
Blood is squeezing and squeezing the blood in the brain, and there is a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered in feathers, with a maximum cotton sheet.
The problem may also be one-time diapers.
"It is more medically demanding, but it would be ideal for the patient to sometimes discover and let the skin spread," said the doctor.
The Torch was burned in Dubai for the second time.
In Dubai, on Friday, one of the world’s largest residential skyscrapers appeared in flames. The firemen had to evacuate all the inhabitants 337 meters high and 79 patrol buildings.
In the last two years, this is the second fire of this height building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch (Pochodsen).
All the inhabitants of the building were evacuated, and there was no injury, and the cause of the fire is unknown.
“We slept and woke us up the alarm.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the inhabitants of the marble.
Dubai civilian defense said that firemen managed to get under control around 4 o'clock in the morning (0:00 GMT) while they continued to cool the building.
Government officials have added that they provide replacement accommodation for the disabled.
The incident could start a discussion again on the safety of materials used to cover high-rise buildings around the world.
From the results of the investigation, which began the management of the Torch marble after the fire in 2015, it appeared that the most damaged linings and external panels used for decoration or insulation were damaged.
The British police said that the system of isolation and lining of the London Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire during the June fire that killed almost 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one of the five passengers to the USA carry out prohibited items on board the aircraft
The passenger survey showed that more than 20 percent of them were consciously or unconsciously declared prohibited items through the control post of the U.S. Government Transport Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers entered the aircraft board with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to be delayed found that they traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
From the results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charter Inc. - and to which more than 1000 questions were answered - it appeared that younger passengers were more likely to breach the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they attempted to travel consciously with the object that was prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand busy hours compared to less than 15 percent of the members of the generation X.
The most common objects that have escaped the attention of TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly reported a sharp course, while 2.2 percent of the women asked and 3.7 percent of the men in question also admitted that they deliberately put on board aircraft banned by drugs.
The company stated that it carried out research between passengers around the world to see how many of them randomly produced illegal items through airport control and how much so agreed.
It is no surprise that most people who have carried illegal objects - whether consciously or unknowingly - travels very often.
As the company emphasised, TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what liquids and what amount they can carry on the plane.
It is not surprising, therefore, that TSA has confiscated the highest amount of currently banned fluids.
Some time, people thought that TSA would deal with books in the same way as smuggled goods.
The transport of liquids is permitted within domestic flights, not international.
EPA Chief Scott Pruitt on the postponement of the planned directives to reduce Obama's emissions
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by 15 states, her boss Scott Pruitt called off his earlier decision to postpone implementation of the plan of former Obama administration to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt has presented changes in his plan, responding more quickly than previous governments have responded to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge raised against his previous position in a federal appeal court.
This is due to the last term, which was set at 1 October, when States should start to comply with the 2015 regulation to reduce the amount of ground ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that the agreement would postpone one year and arrange a more detailed study of the plan in order to avoid “excessing local decisions or threatening economic growth”.
Pruitt, who had served as a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations prior to joining the role of EPA's boss, Donald Trump.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt repeatedly moved or dismissed regulations designed by the chemical and fossil industry.
Sudden Wednesday's turnover is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the U.S. federal appeal court in Washington decided that the enforcer of the EPA exceeded its authority in order to delay the integration of Obama's plan of administration, which required the oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a declaration issued on Wednesday evening Pruitt proposed his version of the ozone standards and strengthened the EPA’s commitment to cooperation with States through complex processes and the fulfilment of new standards within the time frame.
“EPA’s prior administration often did not fulfil deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, in agreement with the settlement and further setting of plans," Pruitt said, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen actions on EPA.
“We do not believe in the regulation of court disputes and we take seriously the execution of the term.
We never joke about our status and the authority that follows it."
The EPA declaration states, however, that Pruitt may use "delayability and all other legally available authorities" at a certain point in order to ensure that the regulation "will be based on sound policy and the most accessible information".
The Republicans at the convention are pushing for a more broad transcript of ozone rules.
The budget of the White House approved last month aims to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measures still haven't passed by the senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, headed by the Coalition of the State, who was suing EPA this week, said that a group would not allow in legal pressure.
"In the opinion of the EPA - following our court over - is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6,7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground ozone occurs when the common harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
The advocates of public health and environmentalists are ingesting Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
"It is worrying what pressure must be developed to change the thinking of responsible persons and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Centre of Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to struggle with the ideological pulling of Trump's administration, which seeks to assist the polluters and special interests."
A cop with acid, yet he's not dangerous according to court.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute, you're home with your family and you're laughing, the other you suddenly change your whole life from scratch.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it at all.
Similar fate met Andrease Christopherose from Great Britain, whose face blinded with acid an unknown attacker, who was eventually released from guilt.
The Reuters website has reported.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at Christophers'.
Andreas picked up to open it up.
He thought there was probably a courier outside the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents to his family that day.
Instead, there was a cruel surprise waiting for him.
The man he's never seen in his life, he's right after the opening without warning, licked the acid with the words, "That's for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The dress fell on me like nothing, and I felt only amazing pain on my skin," Andreas said.
His family quickly brought him to the hospital, but his close friends learned a terrible report - according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would suffer from an infection that threatened to penetrate his wound.
His wound was very serious.
Ninety percent of the patients were hit with a face that the doctors tried to put together using the skin from other parts of the patient's body.
For Christopher, a large complications became a loss of eye bags.
It's probably the saddest thing I've ever seen.
"You cannot hide from an unexpected light, you cannot close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today Christophers has twelve operations that are far from the last.
The injuries that will sustain victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical surgery and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after severe and long-term treatment, the tissue victims are scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Some people don't recover and fight deformation and deformation throughout their lives," said Professor Peter Dowulski, spokesperson of the British Association of Plastic and aesthetic surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain that an unknown man must have been confused with someone.
Because the perpetrator believed that a man who sexually abused his close person was being avenged.
The police have properly investigated the case and subsequently tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict on the amazement of Christopher’s family changed substantially.
"The three judges finally concluded that punishment should be abolished, as man is not considered to be a threat to the public," Christophers said.
Over the last few years, the number of assaults with corrosive substances has increased significantly.
The local Home Office has expressed its view on the issue in order to set new guidelines for state officials on the classification of žiravin.
These should be included in dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks are not an option to surrender.
They demand that the UK Government impose more stringent and longer penalties on the removal of freedom by people who attack their surroundings with acid or other nutrients.
They also require strict controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in various shops, as these are different cleaning devices.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai was burned in the night by the famous clouds The Torch, which belongs to the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Danish civilian defense, the residents of the 1980s were able to evacuate on time and no one was injured.
According to the Dublin spokesperson, the fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, fire broke out in the highest heels and spread down with falling hot wrecks.
We slept.
We were awakened by the alarm, people shouted.
"We walked down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes to get to the 50th floor," said George's tenant's events.
Another one of the CNN witnesses estimated that the flames were about 40 flats.
The fire destroyed at least two cars on the ground when they were caught burning parts of the building.
About two hours later, according to the Civil Defense Communication, fire managed to get under control.
The cause of his creation is not known yet.
According to witnesses in the nearby buildings, the current fell out.
The vast fire damaged the Dublin skycraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Neither did anyone at that time, for the people were able to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became the highest residential building in the world with its 352 metres.
It was prepared for the record immediately next year by another Dublin skycrap.
The culturalist had 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, a varied collection of illicit means occurred in the 23-year-old Ipoppolita sample - from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson’s disease drugs or anorexia.
Paradoxically, this wild mix didn't help him, it ended fourth.
Now, a culturalist threatens a four-year distance and criminal prosecution.
Record was 11.
Last year, the Italian ragista David Vasta was positively tested for 11 doping substances, which was until then a record amount for caught athletes.
The three-legged player began to take steroids a year before the cultural breakdown.
Luka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She was passionate about being a lover!
Solda Luka Vondráčková got up in the territory of the Czech Republic, she's in one wheel.
And he's also paying attention wherever he comes.
Last time she fell into her arms, her former lover Michal Long, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older and longed for his family.
Lucii was only 19 years old at that time, and she definitely didn't want to hang her career on a nail.
So they went apart, but kept their friends to this day.
Which was also proven at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for a long time.
They were both so sweet in blue.
First, they didn't notice each other, but then they got close, and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes when her belly fell.
Then they hugged and asked the photographers willingly.
But their meeting wasn't a coincidence, because they're going to play a love couple in the new Primy Exner series.
The Islamists have been given life in Great Britain for preparing the assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of Islamist cells for life, called the Three Musketeers and planned a terrorist attack against the police and the military, according to the prosecutor's office.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted for similar acts, were arrested last August.
The authorities then thought they were about to attack immediately.
In one of the men's cars, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions, which in Arabic mean "infidels," and a gun mask.
It happened when MI5's secret service agent put the hearing device in the car.
"The recent assassinations showed what horror the defendants could have caused if they weren't stopped," said the D.A. of Sue Hemming.
Three convictions at the age of 28, 25 and 33 may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, 38 years old, can do so after 15 years in prison.
Men during the process in London reported that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car placed MI5 there.
The court also heard him, but then the defendant rejected the claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
They measured 38,3 °C in Hodonínsk.
Tuesday temperature record 37.3 degrees Celsius has only been on a spy for two days.
With 38,3 degrees Celsius, which was recorded in the Watch Tower in Hodoninsk, he overcame Thursday, which has so far become the warmest day of this year.
This was confirmed by Czech hydrometeorological institute workers.
On Tuesday, compared to Tuesday, there were not many heat records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, the records of 35 out of 145 meteorological stations have been overcome or settled for over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
Perhaps the Watchtower had been the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice, Břeclavku, Thursday 37.4th degree exceeded the original maximum of four-tenths and in Pohorickéch in Brno the current 37.1th degree exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as well as the Watchtower, came from 2013.
In the West, it was ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After Strážnice was the greatest heat in Dyjákice in Znojsk and Broda nad Dyja in Břeclav, where mercury reached 37,8 degrees, but the record did not complete.
On the other hand, for example, in the western and northwest Bohemias, according to the ČHMÚ website, the fourth highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The heats started to grow there until now later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually flow off according to ČHMÚ and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
At most Morava places, however, will remain high temperatures still on Fridays and in the south-east of Moravia even on Saturdays.
China misses tourists.
Beijing has lost billions because of visa policy.
China has been trying to apply its influence for decades without using force resources.
He spends $10 billion to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushes his entertainment industry to foreign markets and tries to attract Western tourists.
That's not going well for Beijing.
The state media are talking about a plan to make turism the driving force of economic transformation and modernisation.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent last year and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is caused, among other things, by the fact that despite all its global aspirations, China's foreigner is not welcome with open arms, it assesses the situation in the world's most popular economics professor from Christopher Balding University in an article for Bloomberg.
For example, China's visa policy is the case for everything.
Only 13 countries have visa-free contact with China, the citizens of the others have to deal with the visa in advance.
The Chinese authorities in the USA therefore have crowds comparable to the celebrations of the Chinese New Year.
The visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait long hours in line, you have to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
The Journal of Economics and Finance study showed that the need for a visa reduced the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited the mainland China, while Hong Kong, which shares less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and lives there, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when tourism uses its political objectives, such as in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China in spring reduced transport to South Korea during a break around the South Korean missile system, South Koreans paid her back, and China avoided.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent a year, while Japan recorded an increase of 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to recent U.S. Central Bank reports, the Fed might have left China about 190 billion dollars as a result of Chinese foreign travels, while China will receive about 35 billion dollars annually as a result of currency sales to tourists.
According to the official figures about the development of the balance of payments, China for last year had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism, which is equal to 44 percent of the entire Chinese surplus in goods trade.
The small number of tourists, therefore, of the country, who is anxious to prevent the outflow of capital, is behind a very painful blow.
However, the factors described above are only one expression of more general restraint against foreigners.
In many places, in China, practically no one heard of immigrants.
Even in 2013, less than a million foreigners lived throughout China.
There are more in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroad of immigration, has doubles.
A number of scientific work shows that immigrants tend to revive economic growth, business and innovation.
In China, however, you will not practically find them.
It will be politically difficult to solve these problems, but the step offered is the simplification of the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, in particular India and Vietnam, have been developing a great effort recently to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen zoo, they reproduced deadly poisonous plagues.
The Plzeň Kingdom poison can enjoy three rare, deadly, poisonous beaches.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine fresh Turkish winters.
This species lives in North Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
"The mercenary lengths are growing," wrote the spokesperson of the zoo Martin Vobrub.
The young people of the other two species, the mortals and the cobras of the red, will gain strength in the breeding background of the gardens.
We can't tell when people will see them.
"We wouldn't like to lose them," said the nurse Miroslav Dohled, saying it could take a year or two.
The Australian deaths came to the world of eight, they're descendants of a couple from a population in Sydney's surroundings.
"The individual that visitors may see in the exhibition belongs to the mortals from around Perth," Vobrub said, "the human care of the dead is necessary to winter 6 to 8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius.
100 percent success was accompanied by a dream of African spitting cobras in red.
A couple at the plenary zoo were hatched out of four eggs in total four babies.
"Incubation took 65 days," added Vobrub.
This kind of nature in nature at its victim sprays poison, within a distance of up to four meters.
He's heading for his eyes, he can cause a permanent blindness.
The babies of all three species are fed in the zoo by mouse toads.
In 40 days in the garden still expects a kiss from a dream of black moms, eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to the unsolicited transcription of the phone interview, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico because of paying behind the border wall.
Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with Mexican and Australia leaders.
In a telephone interview of 27 January with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nietem, Trump instructed him to stop speaking publicly that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed walls.
The American president told him that he publicly condemns the wall building, saying, "You can't talk in the press like that."
Trump promised in his campaign that he would build a wall along the southern borders and say he would pay Mexico for it.
The public also escaped the transcript of his first call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing the intense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. surveillance agreement on refugees heading to Australia was “murder” and“ stupid” and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came under President Obama’s rule - would look like “driving” after he proposed a ban on the entry of refugees into the US.
Trump terminated the call after Turnbull explained that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk told the D.A. again about Smolenko.
"He has nothing to fear," said the brother of the dead president, Chairman of the Government Party of Law and Justice PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński at Tusko's address.
"I have nothing to worry about, Kaczyński will not scare me," Tuksk said, and told the current leadership of the country that he was trying to abuse the justice of political opponents.
On leaving the U.S. Attorney's office he waited for Tusk according to TVN 24 crowd, which was chanting Donald Tusk! and wished politics for 100 years!.
Tusk thanked for his support and assured him that he had a clean conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczynski will fear me."
The prosecutors say nothing, but no doubt that justice has to serve as an instrument against rivals, oppositions or people who don't like, and I'm afraid that I belong to this group.
He was second time in the interrogation.
The outsider was questioned at the D.A.'s office for the second time, this time the interrogation was about to deal with the concerns of the victims of the Smolean disaster.
After all, the bodies in coffins came to be replaced.
The families have forbidden to open coffins, and there must have been some reason for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of scandal because they would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Continuing good relations at all costs, despite such terrible events, should serve to make Donald Tusk become someone very important in the EU," said Kaczynski on Catholic television Trwam.
He added that the potential for conflict with Russia would ruin Tuskov's chance to get the most important seat in the union, which, however, Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczyński also stated that he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it could happen differently with Donald Tusek, but she didn't realize it.
Tusk has undergone an eight-hour interview at the prosecutor's office on 19 April.
Even then, he didn't say as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his calls for questioning were considered to be part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the head of PiS Kaczynski discredit Tusk as a political opponent by connecting with various scandals.
The prosecutor's office in Poland is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who acts as a Attorney General.
The call for questioning was followed by the election of Tusk to the head of the European Council, which Kaczyński was working hard to prevent, among other things, from visiting Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tuskova's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová objected alone.
In this case, he left both Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Warsaw.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote on the composition of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections that took place in 2013.
It flows from a decree that regulates the addition of voting tickets to a foreign country.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs prepared its update; it is currently in a reminder procedure.
Four years ago, a Member of the Czech Republic voted abroad for 10,000 Czech citizens.
"Since the last amendment of the Decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry justifies its procedure.
"In some countries new representative offices have been established, some authorities have been closed, where appropriate a change in the level of representation," writes the material.
The notice shall contain two Annexes, of which the representative offices on which the paper voting cards are added are first indicated.
This group of authorities includes representations of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive the voting note in the print version.
They're just changing their list with order.
Four years ago, the Czech Republic could vote, for example, at the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today both embassys are closed.
The Czech Republic has also cancelled its representation in Bamaku and Japanese Kyoto.
He won't even vote for the general consulate in Donetsk.
This Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in the east of Ukraine.
They are on the list of embassys in Nairobi, Senegal's capital of Dakar and Zambian Lusace.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has extended its representation of the Consulate General in Iraq Irbíl and Čcheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province of S'chuan.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs have had the opportunity to choose Members in electoral rooms at representative offices or consulates so far four times.
Before each election of the State Election Commission, the country for which candidates are voted abroad shall be set at random.
It was the first time in 2002 when decisions were made between South Moravian candidates.
The following two elections were voted by the Czech Republic abroad among the Southern candidates.
In 2013, as well as this year, the Mediterranean Region was selected.
The number of Czechs voting in a foreign country is steadily increasing.
During the premiere 15 years ago, there were about 3800 people, in 2006, around 6700, four years later, 8222.
The early House elections took place four years ago at the embassy of 10.571 voters.
Masacre on the Moore's Ford Bridge: activists have reminded themselves of racist lynching
Ford Mercury, from 1948, drove past the surrounding inhabitants of Monroe, Georgia andcrical towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the car with the four passengers of the black skin and the white driver was able to reach the bridge, a group of white people with guns replaced it.
Group leader - male middle age in a striped suit - long hauled from a cigarette and looked at the front glass of the car.
Inside, the passengers were shaking with fear.
"We want this n--- Roger!" cried a man.
Bring him to me!
The silence breaks the sound of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction event that took place on July 22nd.
But when one of the men crosses the "Roger's" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, Moore's Ford's Bridge has been returning to a regular group of activists who reconstruct the fateful night of 1946, when two Black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray - were killed by the members of the Kukluxklan.
No one's been tried for murder yet.
“It is strange that in all these years only one person has not been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," Tyron Brooks, who helped restore the event.
"It's a stain on our history and burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of Georgia State and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic challenge for action. Every year, the community of Monroe recalls that justice has not been done for enough.
"We require judicial prosecution and the conclusion of the case, we want peace in mind and reconciliation, but, above all, justice," Brooks said.
"The recovery and reconciliation process cannot be initiated until then."
On July 27, 1946, the medical examiner is holding one of the bodies of the victim of lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI files received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts were to be involved.
However, no one has been prosecuted yet.
While suspects remain free for decades, civil rights supporters claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the citizens of the city.
In April 1946, black people in Georgia had the right to participate for the first time in elections scheduled for summer, based on the decision of the Supreme Court.
And right in the summer elections, according to the FBI, a black farmer named Roger Malcom had to stab the owners of Barnett Hester's land during the struggle - allegedly because of his wife.
Well, in the city, Brooks said Hester was in contact with Malcom's wife Dorothy, and he brought her to another state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the then important owner of Loy Harrison's white skin land for Malcoma bailed at $600.
Dorothy and his cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey brought him to prison.
Returning from prison, just before entering the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects replaced their journey.
"As it turned out, he planned murder and organized Harrison," the FBI brought out.
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local defenders of the law, who have not only participated in lynching, but also removed evidence and hidden the identity of witnesses."
Brooks referred to the whole matter more briefly.
"It was a massacre for electoral law," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the locals of the black skin: "You're going to get your hands on this if you register and vote."
Every year, an event reconstruction at Moore's Ford Bridge is organized by Cassandra Greene for almost ten years.
Her performance is graphic, tacit, and exacting, showing a deeply rooted racism that many would like to think was exterminated in modern America.
To follow this reconstruction is not easy and even more difficult is to reverse the sight, but Greene says it has its meaning.
“No one wants to talk about lynching, because in doing so we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each one of us,” Greene said.
“But we can't have a relationship unless you hear what I had to go through.”
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June and the first day about 30 actors - a dozen white boys, the rest of black - went into the room where Greene met them with a very carefully scheduled performance.
Wade Marbugh is doing the role of assistant director.
For many years, the leader of Kukluxklan played, but according to his word, the role is grueling.
“I feel bad about it because it contradicts who I am” said Marbaugh.
“I think it is very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to return to that age.”
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcom, but Barnett Hester, train their roles.
The presentation starts with a struggle - Malcom arguing with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my property, n-e!"
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
There's a struggle.
At that moment, everyone (or every actor of the black skin) will explode in laughter.
Greene's laughing at everyone's most.
"What's happened?" he's turning on Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," says Greene.
“I just don’t think white people called it "n-r' such a tone."
"Exactly," one of the actors will win the black skin.
"You must place more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; enemies will replace the feeling of getting closer.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to make sure it's taken up by four victims of the massacre.
Scene actors repeat.
Rascona puts emphasis on the correct words on N.
No one's laughing now.
The presentation ends violently and quickly.
The screams, the gunshots... and the eternal silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of actors and is drinking a grieving song by Billie Holiday "Strange Fruit".
With every word in the room, it feels sad.
In the background of all of this, about a dozen of the sightings wipe their sweat and tears out of his eyes.
In the audience there are practically the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple came up from New York Ithaca, many of the sightings from nearby.
Each one of them endures local wet climates for almost eight hours, and Brooks is in the crowd leading to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until this moment, the murder could have been seen with a distance, but now, standing in the same place as lynching, the atmosphere is scary.
The last words of the song invite Greene crowd to watch the body inspection.
The kids kneel to the victim's heads, follow false blood, and still bodies, and whisper something in their ear.
"They're not dead," the little boy is going to blow up.
He'll run a few minutes, and Greene will thank the audience.
Actors clean the rope and make tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaught, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascon, let's hug two of his friends and cry in their arms; eventually, he's touched by emotions.
"That's okay," whispers one of the women.
“We know you have the role to play.
But you had a reason for that."
Later that day, the audience will meet with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are in the middle of a while talking about a show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words to express her feeling from today's show.
“It is difficult to listen to the ugly words and to look at the horrific deeds... held by people who look like you and do it because they look like you” she said to rebuild.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still an up-to-date topic,” she added, “just called it police problems.”
On the other hand of the room there is Tyrone Brooks in the courtroom, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already started planning his performance for the following year.
“The reconstruction of these events is inspiring, because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think,” he said.
“ If we don’t learn from this, who knows... it might happen again.
The people who do not know and do not study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love the instructions to use.
A friend of mine says she only reads chicken instructions.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With the nostalgic memory of the past, where instructions to use whatever was rather a rarity phenomenon.
So, for example, my first turntable contained only one paper, on which the hieroglyphs were showing the involvement of some parts, all of them were secret marks.
When something went wrong inside of me after years, I offered that letter to a shaman who wasn't afraid to screw his back board.
He told me with a little bit what it was suitable for.
Yes, it was a used aid for chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He found the wire on the edge and allowed me to listen again to expensive vinyl plates.
New times brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where it simply stuck to the overcrowded hare, required about ten pictures.
Especially leading was a drawing with a description of how to put one part into another.
The set was two-piece and another procedure simply could not be possible.
On the contrary, it was necessary to make considerable efforts to break down certain plastic components.
My contempt of the instructions ended at my seat Leon self-movement.
The year 2003 still had such a book with instructions for minor repairs, including the exchange of light bulbs.
It was simple.
Three steps in total and the work was supposed to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the pattern forgot to mention that while the light bulb right went to replace really only in three steps.
1st separate cover.
2. Screw the cracked light bulb and screw up a new one.
3rd move the cover.
The left bulb had a problem in the form of a battery cover.
At first I thought that by moving the right upper limbs into the impact of the car, I would eat some rubber screws, which would be easy to remove, and then I would already follow points 1-3 of the energy-saving author of the service book.
I think it's the lava.
The cover didn't have any space, no space, no space for the slim handle of Cinderella, no matter how obsessive Slezana.
I've lost half an hour of my life without any success.
The state was still forced by my wife's entry into the garage, which he called for the knight and the words which from my mouth heard quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked without fail.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I skip the vulgar terms, only two published words remained.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why does it take you so long?" risked a sentence that could be her last in a long term.
I slowly explained the problem to her, and the main emphasis I put on the course of torture by the author of the instruction, where blessing with the burning iron on her hand, which the instructions she wrote, following her comfort, so that she could never write anything again, was just an introduction to a wide range of instructions by Kladiva on the witch, including his chamber burning on the top of the Losin castle.
"How about removing the box?" The woman meant putting out the battery.
This occurred in a clear despair, and then step 1-3 was just as easy and quick as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just discussing from the collapse state after checking out two state departments for drug control.
I know him as a colleague who has experienced even impossible in the field, and who can interpret wild stories with uninterrupted voice.
"Contend that I received a fine for not having completed the instructions for washing my hand," he told me with a weak voice.
Gradually, I raised the whole problem, which he touched that there was no graphic instructions over the sink in the patient's bathroom, how to wash his hands.
His argument as commission official that grown-up hands tend to be good, and that it does not require pictograms to overcome the usual activities of decent people, had no healing effect and cost him little money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple engulfing of soapy palms flowing with water is a primitive act at the level of cromanon, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, is doing this ceremony in ten steps.
So it must be said that it is necessary to let the tap out of the water.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end, it's a happy finding that a man washed his hands exactly as he ordered it from a U.S.O.
Finally, I must note that I have been inspired and prepared a detailed plan for action in the bathroom.
On the issue of defecation is a procedure of uniformity, there will not arise the problem of urination, given the difference between both sexes, two instructions will have to be put out.
The problem remains the pictograms, because creating a perfect procedure means even the exact drawing of all the anatomical details, which could wake up a certain insurrection with a bright visitor to the toilet, resisting the fact that it can finally learn that it had been a very wrong process throughout his life.
Pearson will release another 3,000 employees and reduce dividends in an effort to revive trade
On Friday, the British Pearson School stated that they would release another 3,000 employees and reduce the provisional dividend by 72 percent in response to the further restructuring programme to change the business model.
Another wave of redundancies, which, according to John Fallon's Executive Director at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, followed by the previous decision of the company to release 4000 employees in the framework of previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by further £300 million (394 million) in May in the third programme to reduce costs in order to increase the growing trade due to the sharp development of digital education.
The company, which agreed to sell its share in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann last month, stated that the outlook for this year remained unchanged after it reported a single percentage increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to GBP 2.05 billion.
Attack on the convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide explosion
A suicide bomber attacked an army convoy in the capital of Afghanistan Kabul. During the attack one NATO soldier died and several others were injured, reported official representatives.
Five soldiers and interpreters were injured, and NATO was expressed.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians died in Qarabagh City.
This month, Afghanistan hit a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday in an explosion in the Heratian mosque.
On Monday, a suicide attacker killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that the Tuesday explosion occurred after the patrol and the members of the Afghan army were attacked by a "local person with a submersible produced by an explosive device".
The statement also states that all the injuries of soldiers are out of danger to life and are located in the U.S. military hospital on the air base of Bagrám.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of Taliban and groups known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern for NATO's allies in the nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of which died in the capital city.
At the end of July, at least 30 people in the Shia District died of a bomb in the car.
The Taliban applied to the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people have killed a large explosion in the city center. It is the deadliest military attack in the country since the U.S. troops rejected the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence has already undermined the questionable situation in Afghanistan and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. soldiers who should help military troops and policemen in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks followed by the public's confidence in the government in recent weeks, its regulation and particularly in the reputation of President Ašraf Ghanín.
EPA re-evaluated its decision to suspend smoking rules in response to the action
The US Environmental Protection Agency has called off its decision to postpone Obama's Law of Administration, which has ordered the States to reduce emissions, only the day after the Agency has sued 15 States.
The EPA announced its decision on the accession of the ‘Ozon Standards 2015’ in Wednesday hours, in the words that the Agency’s commitment to cooperation with the States is being submitted.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and hear their views," said CEO Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the attempt of the EPA to set aside ozone standards - which measured actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and determined the limits to be met by October 2018.
The 15th group of most democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., brought action on Tuesday, justifying that EPA negotiations are illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trumpa seeks to prevent many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words in an attempt to kick economic growth.
However, the efforts of the new government have begun countermeasured by democrats and conservative groups that are concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA on its website states that the breathing of air with the ozone content “may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnar got hurt and the blood flowed!
Toto, with us quite a new singer, you may have already registered in June this year, when this almost unknown singer has organized a monstrosity event on Czech terms, on which he has hosted such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simon Krainová and many others, and the event has not been demonstrated by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, show up to the public and introduce his music video to Sara's song, whose baptism was just named personalities.
But few people already know that the filming itself of the video that took place in Russia was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big film with the stars of Russia's national ballet, and it didn't happen without a lot of trouble.
Sara's song is very emotional and based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene, the singer's son-in-law had a slap shot in the video clip.
At one point, however, he was struck so strongly and directly into the nose that young singers had to treat the physician.
"It was this morning, I didn't expect it, I immediately lost my nose blood," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers told themselves it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav did not catch up in time to react.
Fortunately, the injury was not as serious as to affect the continuation in the next filming.
We're bringing you a video of a young artist mentioned here, and you can also record the scene with a punch.
The unbleached version with blood, but it was not better to use.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers, who could inspire the most tense boxing match in the lightweight, first met at Tuesday's meeting.
Each of them was located in a separate room in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - an undefeated World Boxing Council champion - came down to the hall, where he welcomed Lomachenko, championed in the world Boxing Organization's dick.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-fold world champion, Adrien Broner, in a Saturday's Showtime fight, both boxers got on the list of five top boxers in a lightweight.
Garcia pulled his right hand and said: “How's it going, champion?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends her degree against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers ask for photographers and manager of Lomachka Egis Klimas adds that the potential fight of boxers would be a “perfect test”.
“I am a former champion in a dickweight” adds Garcia.
“I had to raise for a fight with Broner (67 kg) but I'm not that big.
On my 63 kg, I'm small.
I'd like to go back to the category of light weights.
The Lomachian has to re-attach to get to the ease of weight... then we can get stuck.
That's what fans want.
Why don't you let them do it."
Lomeck's in agreement.
"The box would be good for this game."
Klimas made a request to pay for the look-out - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should perform his debut in a light weight at the end of this year and next year to face up with Garcia (37-0, 30 knock-offs) who also expressed interest in the fight against the duel of Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will run on 23 September for a lightweight in the arena of Forum.
"The match should take place in the style of the payment for the sightings, that is what fans want," said Garcia, who later expressed his view that it is open to broadcast the match through a television station that comes with the best offer.
“We are the main attractions.
No one else will draw such attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said that he recognized Lomachenko as a “great boxer” and could participate in his Saturday fight.
But the Lomachian didn't give Garcia a gleaming round when he said the three Riverside divisions champion looked "very slow... I'm sorry, Mike, but you're talking about the knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said they felt a rising tension against each other's duel.
“You can’t just forget about this game.
There's no other game that takes so much attention.
And I will put great comfort in the fire," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great game."
Young couple 12 years ago disappeared without a trace.
Their car was just found at Volha's bottom.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
They had a large search, but without success.
And the police ended the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened to a couple.
After 12 years came the sad ending of the whole story.
The wreck of their car found a lay diver on the bottom of the river Volga in the town of Čeboxara in Čuvaska.
Only thanks to the evidence left in the car, a few police officers managed to identify.
The evidence would have survived the entire decade under water, without them it would take much longer to identify the identity found.
A couple were last spotted when Žirnov borrowed his car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous so far.
He reported his findings to the Cheboxarian police, which the following day pulled the car to the beach.
The investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a frozen road leading around the river.
However, the investigation shall continue, as soon as it has been completed, further details will be published.
Most recent results of the tests for establishing the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that more than 80 percent of people were asked as older than 18 years old, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forenz Medical Agency (Rüttsmedicinalverket) has started to carry out new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to better assess applicants when evaluating asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failure to determine the right age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency sent 6880 cases to be examined and the Military Medical Agency has now published a total of 2481 tests, conducted from mid March to July 31, 2017.
80 percent (2002) was assessed as over 18 years old, while in another 25 cases the Military Medical Agency considered that the question was “maybe over 18 years old”.
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the question was “maybe under 18 years old”.
The tests shall be taken only if the age of the contested person is disputed.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson, the forensic medical agency's results correspond to the previous month.
"Against the last month, statistics are held in occupied tracks and numbers are very similar," said The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that “the person concerned is 18 years of age or older”.
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 cases published and found that in 243 cases he stated that he would have 18 years this year.
Critics also received a medical method for determining age, which includes x-ray teeth of wisdom and MRI windows of knee joint, which subsequently assess dentists and x-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with the assessment of people's biological maturity to determine the age when he went through the teenager concerned.
“I had a reason to think about this, and I don’t think that these types of measurement for age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is in a sense very uncertain.
If we cannot determine age with accuracy, we should not pretend the opposite," he said for the Metro newspaper.
The forensic medical agency Agency Agenty's GÃ¶ransson advocated the decision by saying: “Evidently, it can be said that the risk of a child’s misrepresentation as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person concerned is just below the limit of 18 years, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all the questions asked."
Trump threatened President Mexico on the phone.
American President Donald Trump in January's phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peň Niet threatened to meet him, if he publicly says that his country will not pay for building a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that funding would somehow be arranged even if he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly with Austrian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It stems from the transcripts of the interviews that the American daily The Washington Post published on Thursday.
Trump made the building of a wall on the south border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
Right in the first interview with the Mexican president shortly after taking up the position of Trump Peña Nieta did not undiplomaticly scoundrel for his plan to build a wall.
The South neighbor has ruled out as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican President to publicly say that his government will never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump said repeatedly in an interview on January 27 and threatened by interruptions of contacts with the Mexican president if he continues to make retaliatory statements.
He said he's going to come up with some kind of financing, and it's going to work out well eventually.
"But if you're going to say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to meet you gentlemen anymore, because it's unacceptable to me," Trump said.
The wall has marked the least important thing we're talking about, but politically it may be the most important thing.
Effective order to build the Trump wall shortly after power took over.
Mexico refuses to build and finance a wall of 3200 kilometres, due to this, the relations of both countries have also been won.
At the end of March Trump said that the project would be paying for the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart at the July Summit G20 in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also announced Trump's phone interview with Austrian Prime Minister Turnbull on 28 January.
The White House chief of the conversation called it ridiculous.
This conclusion has led him to exchange views on the agreement that Australia will grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the acceptance of persons from emergency facilities in the Pacific.
Trump considered the deal a fool at first, but later he joined it.
"You can clearly say that this is not the agreement you have made, but you will have to stick to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost journalistic, for example when Trump appreciated as a good idea of Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump was joking.
Suddenly, the tone of the conversation is getting worse.
"I hate receiving these people," Trump said.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
"They will not be great people who will go to work for local milkers," he said.
He also noted in the interview that a fugitive could become an assassin in Boston in five years.
Trump led by the end of January, approximately one week after coming to the White House, telephone talks with a number of world statesmen, often even a few days ago.
The call with Turnbull ended up calling for the least pleasant of the day.
Before he finished it, he exclaimed that he had had a pleasant conversation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia earlier.
Rana's killer was executed before the crowd.
Her father was also watching.
The execution took place at the square in Yemen Sana.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose Ran Almatari as his victim, a little girl who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped a girl, took her father's home, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He subsequently raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl hit the whole country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first place of the thousand-headed crowd that met to become a witness to execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under the law of Sharia.
The victim's father told the media his feelings.
I feel reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's the new day of my life.
Even the other family members were present, together with the crowd, shouted the word "always of justice".
A rapper in the square brought in a police van that was taken out of.
The cops put him on his stomach.
One of the members turned his gun against him, and from the immediate vicinity he launched fire.
The present crowd celebrated every blow that was fired.
Mr Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice was executed in accordance with the rule of law of the country.
"Justice, Allah, and the law of Sharia have won," he added.
I was standing at the Sana City Square waiting to be executed by my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ran's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
Me and my wife Jami Leh are grateful that justice has been done.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered in the square would fall through hateful madness, the killer would fall down and lynched.
The execution was ordered by a court which is under the administration of Shiite Hútí.
Originally, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 whip wounds immediately after the arrest, but his act gave rise to such a defeat that the judge decided for the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27th.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched his house's basement, she found evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even the animal would be more merciful to the morning.
"Our family has no enemies and the injury that didn't match Ran's body was terrible," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her picture were hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer parents who suspected their son from a terrible act.
A girl's mother, Jamileh, must have been hospitalized after knowing that her daughter's body was found.
Rana used to play out with other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took the cars and drove around, but we were looking for nothing.
The residents of Yemen were disgruntled and began to gather themselves in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was held and to demand immediate punishment.
Deputy Ministry of Justice read the present crowd's investigation record to calm them down.
The accused apparently did not show regret over his actions.
Just before he was punished, the police read him a verdict, but the defendant looked at his executioner for years.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but on the Internet there were many records that the crowd had made.
The Governor of West Virginia announced a change of political party
On Thursday night, the Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced at President Trump's meeting that he was going to another party.
"Although you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," said Governor Justice.
"Today after long prayer and reflection, I tell you... today as residents of West Virginia, I say that I cannot continue to support you from the position of a democratic governor."
The representation of the sightings has erupted in joy.
"I will report tomorrow to the Republicans," he added.
"As a coach, I can tell you, it's time to jump into another match."
Trump had already promised people an important announcement to attend a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won the West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice was not supported by the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited great assets from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at USD 1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying: "The Governor Justice is another morning for a democratic party that puts obstacles in our way instead of taking up our country."
“For a democratic party with only 15 governors and controlled by least legislative authorities in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is the last drop for the already consumed party without the leader, who is in vain seeking to find positive and unifying reports," said RNC Ronna McDaniel, President in her statement for CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's “faith” excuse for the doping scandal
The former outstanding sportsman Sebastian Coe praised Russia's sincere apology for the Doping scandal on Thursday, but repeated that Russia's return to the sports world was not yet the right time.
Head of the Russian Athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place at the eve of the MS in athletes - that firing his country from the world of sport was right and that it was determined to fight the doping.
He apologized “all atlets who thus lost gold and silver medals.”
Despite his comments, IAAF members voted in favour of maintaining the ban which entered into force in November 2015, following the report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
"I think today we have seen very honest answers and presentations," said President IAAF Sebastian Coe to journalists.
"All members of the council and the congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia was wrong and was working with all the strength to correct and restore the proper function of the whole Federation."
Coe said that Russia was also pleased to adopt criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we proceeded to the next level, but the congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to preserve the punishment that was imposed on Russia," said Coe.
“In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate honest athletes from those disrespectful," he said.
On an athletic MS, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under neutral flag, which have fulfilled the strict IAAF rules.
IAF Run Andersen, head of crisis staff, said Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it was admitted back.
The tests for drug presence are still unsatisfactory and the exclusion of trainers continues to operate, he told the reporters in London after the end of the presentation of the IAAF Board.
The CzechTrad State Order got the company František Savova, whose state is pursuing.
The publication of the Young Front of František Savova was awarded by the public contract of the state transport agency CzechTrade.
Officials have given him 100 percent of the points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind the Czech state pursuing Savov for tax fraud and asking for his release to the Czech Republic.
The Agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrad published in April a public contract for four years providing editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
A total of CZK 30.8 million received the publisher of the Young Business Front František Savova.
The Czech police have already accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are chasing him on the run.
Savov fled to Great Britain and Czech Republic asked for his release.
In case he alerted the server Currently.cz.
According to the original CzechTrad criteria, the contract was to decide from 60 percent of the price offered and from the remaining 40 beauty competition, i.e. the quality of the project.
At the same time, it was the second criterion that helped Savov’s company significantly.
According to Dotyk.cz, 100 points were received in all sub-quality criteria.
This was the result of the shift before the next candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with an amount of 404 900 crowns a month, VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received 62 points from the assessors in all qualitative criteria.
The Tend also participated in the consultant BDO Advisory and the digital R-Media agency, which falls as well as the server News.cz under the publisher Economia.
The VLM issue has opposed the result of a series of objections to the fact that it is considered unfair and insufficiently justified.
Following their refusal, it decided to bring about competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the UNOHS.
He believes that CzechTrad was acting contrary to the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has taken a decision to select a public contract supplier on the basis of a fair subjective assessment, a clearly favoring participant of Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the plaintiff and other suppliers," writes the proposal for the opening of the procedure given at ÚOHS this week, which published the server on the current basis.
According to the Director-General and Chairman of the VLM Board, Michal Klíma appears to be unfaithful and 100% review of the Mladé front project for all of her members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such miraculous success to be unlikely and suspicious," Klíma said.
The CzechTraade has not yet expressed its view on the situation.
The CzechTrad Agency will not, in principle, comment on public contracts before closing them.
All information about you mentioned by the contract is in accordance with the law published in the Contractor's Profile and in the Public Contract Register.
"After the contract is completed, a complete written report will be published, but we cannot speak to the Agency during the duration of the contract," said Štěpán Longh.cz media representative of the agency.
The young front reacted with a statement that it considers extremely problematic that the publisher Economics hit the article in News.cz in the competition where he has his own business interests.
However, this fact has been mentioned in that Article.
In the counter, it could have helped her to provide BusinessInfo with editorial services in the past four years.
For the first time in 2013, the Ministry of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savova blames the police on tax evasion in connection with the excessive deduction of VAT of his companies, which caused the Czech State an alleged damage of up to CZK 770 million.
Czech Republic has been asking the UK to issue it since 2014.
According to Savov, he is responsible for his criminalisation, the leader of the movement of ANO Andrej Babiš, under whose influence Mafra's publishers fall.
The London Court of Last year Savov's appeal against the issue was rejected, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view last year, the case has not moved anywhere, from Great Britain we have not received any information in the case of legal power,," said Štěpánek Zenklová, spokesperson of the Prague City State Prosecutor.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Fronts, Savov was named at Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, which controlled the Kescobudov Brewery Samson, and in the Cyprus company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, which buys at risk of assets.
He should even control the shortfall of Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, who owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov has been associated with raising assets from the local Socialist Union of Youth.
The biker drove down the walkways and the park, ended up in cots.
The biker took attention to himself with careless ride along the streets, walkers and park trails in Úšovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to take her in the direction of Stanoviště.
"Policy men followed the city with increased caution when, on one of the side roads behind the Mariánské Lázněs, he couldn't control the proceedings and took the motorcycle into the field where he crashed," said police spokesperson Daniel Dvořák.
In the end, an ambulance helicopter had to be sent to the Pilsen hospital to transport the injured biker.
The police discovered that the motorbike driver's driving licence, the registration marks on the motorcycle were removed, his production number cut out and the production label itself removed.
It's so possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is further investigated.
"The breath test carried out was excluded on the basis of the presence of alcohol in the driver, but a positive result was detected on the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesperson said.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymara's move to Paris
The rules limiting the funding of European football clubs do not interfere with Neymar's record transfer from Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penance for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA organisations, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Liza Champions.
The rules of financial fair play (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 provide that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million only to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will pay a few dozen million dollars a year.
Several financial conditions followed by Neymar's transfer to France.
Since PSG is funded by a rich Catholic family that has richly sold energy, it can afford to bring Neymara to such a star football family.
Clubs can spend on buying players huge amounts, but on the other hand they have to demonstrate legal income sources, allowing them to cover the cost of business activities related to football.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after joining the seat of the Director of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs which, in pursuit of new reinforcements, are ultimately cheating and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refuse to provide them.
In 2011, the FFP rules redirected its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the trading model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spend the hot sum on players y to build a global brand - suddenly it was not that beneficial.
In the framework of the current three-year test period, ending in 2018, clubs may report losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Alexander Čeferin, is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
"FFP's rules still apply and we are committed to strengthening them in the future," said Andrea Traverso last week for the Associated Press, who oversees compliance with FFP rules.
Although PSG has paid the amount for the purchase of Neymar in a one-off payment, it may, for accounting purposes, distribute the amount for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be signed at EUR 44,4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of FFP’s highest sanctions hit PSG in 2014 together with Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi.
PSG took a fine of EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and the order to reduce the team of the Champions League to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of 25 players.
UEFA takes care of teams that can attempt to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through a club owners company.
Therefore, even if the Catalan company sponsors PSG as soon as the funding exceeds the standard market rate, the UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
The EUFA joined this measure in 2014, after deciding that the amount of funding given by Qatar Tourism Authority of the PSG team was too high.
Part of Neymar's revenue in PSG could be paid according to some of the reports from the MS Organising Commission in Football 2022 in Qatar.
However, PSG and MS 2022 in Qatar denied the fact that Neymat should become Ambassador to the MS in football and that such a maneuver would be easily revealed by UEFAY officials.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to the Tuesday expressed dedicated persons, UEFA did not initiate any investigation into PSG through Neymara.
The source of this report wanted to remain anonymous because it was not justified to comment on the situation with PSG, said The Associated Press.
The latest published accounts show that PSG concluded the year 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
Accounting accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymara's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and sales of uniforms.
The club promises a turnover increase of up to 30 percent from the contract signature.
The leaders of the Spanish League, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to destroy Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would violate FFP rules.
“It is a clear case of the “financial doping” club and the state," said La Ligy Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club by the Catarist Syndicat.
The manager of Arsenal Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnate, shares the same attitude as La Ligy about financing the club.
“This is the result of ownership that has changed the football world in the last 15 years,” Wenger heard on Thursday.
“As soon as the club owner becomes a club owner, everything is possible.
Compliance with financial fair play rules is very difficult because the state can have various interests in participating such players in its club."
Spartan reserve Russian: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand amateur footing fans.
Tomáš Rosický is going to the square.
Same scene as the Sunday game against the Bohemians.
Spartian observatorie bent against Crvene Take a game, invented several goals, but his teammates didn't go black.
The Summer team, pumped with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, ends after the initial two-fold in European Cups.
Was it hard with the match to do something else after Belgrade's goal?
After the inquisition of the goal, it was necessary to shoot four, which was hard for us.
At least we wanted to not lose, raise our confidence so that we could turn ourselves away from anything else.
We had a chance.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the game for so long?
The game is very well worked.
The combination of rivals was much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, we fired once in half.
That's very little, of course, when you have to win two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you need to push opponents more often into such positions.
Is there a problem with a large number of changes in the assembly?
Of course, it's one of the pains of a new manhood.
We only played three contest games and the lineup is still changing.
The point is, the coach can find an ideal 11-year-old who sits down.
Is it comforting for you that you've already played a part of two fights together?
It's still just a part of the game.
I don't know how my condition is going to evolve, and when can I play from the beginning?
Are you still optimistic about the changes that happened in Sparta?
We have to be, or else we can't.
It's the same as the injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
Fans came back in great numbers, but left in despair.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, just like with God.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show me something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can the season without a cup be at least an advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting ourselves, we're getting played, so that's not the advantage for us.
For an extreme tax evasion, a businessman has to sit down for ten years.
The Constitutional Court has rejected the complaint made by the businessman Jiří Toman, who is responsible for cutting taxes to a large extent serving ten years in prison.
The estimated damage is CZK 645 million.
Toman claimed in the complaint that justice had infringed his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
The Constitutional Judges, however, referred to the complaint as unjustified, found the ČTK from the court's database.
There is no further appeal court.
"It cannot, as fourth instance, assess the facts or legal doubts allegedly committed by general courts if they do not constitute infringements of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," states the resolution.
Toman was judged as escaped.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015 when the Supreme Court of Olomouc confirmed it.
At that time, Toman was in a performance bond in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, was also at the time of decision-making of the ÚS.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage suffered.
The main court has referred the case to it as an extreme tax evasion which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the World Servis Board between 2005 and 2008.
Škoda 645 million crowns were created only for the period from January to July 2008, the total spillage according to the expert exceeded a billion.
However, for procedural reasons it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the entire amount.
According to the prosecution, World Servis did not include all the invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT contributions and excise duties, at least tens of millions of crowns paid taxes in just hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with whom the company was trading have a relationship with the entrepreneurs of Radomír choose, whom justice was aimed at machinations with VAT in oil trade for 13 years in prison.
He also rejected his complaint before the time of the Constitutional Court.
The series “Léto Unliving” and “Comrade Detective” play on the nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic both for characters from the famous 80s; and for the dirty 90s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter put on MTV the comedy sketch "The State"); and of course also for modern times, in particular 2001 before the stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd opened up for bigger projects.
As a cultural artefact, it is a light parody and also the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of permanent memories.
But it looks like someone's breathing.
The “First Day of Camp” series worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humour (for example, the story about the formation of talking cans with vegetables, which H. Jon Benjamin had said).
Authors leaned away from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who played teen horny children - and couldn't pull from previous events.
Continued "This Years Late", in which adults play as much as an emotional plane and satira, is a place of sporadic nature, including a 90-year thriller parody as the "Ruka on a collebre" in the 1990s.
At one point, a character will find on a pile of Apple Powerbook harps, roller skates, and “the rest of the 1991 stuff”.
Many of the main stories lines are repeated.
Dobrordrený Coop (Mr. Showalter), now the writer, has still not moved over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr Showalter), who is excited by George H. W. Bush (very well occupied by Michael Ian Black).
As always, they are the best part of the Francis Islands many side stories.
Especially fun is to watch the young Rudd with long hair and character Matt Dillon from the movie Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now behind the old pepper.
The French could start moments of accidental madness, such as the most retractive series "Seven Up", until it reaches what I assume will be logical: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Late," when the group will be released in the final scene on the premiere of "Léta to Unliving."
In the meantime, "Comrade Detective" appeals to another kind of nostalgy: revivalism of the Cold War of the series "So Normal Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde: No regrets" and even the "GLOW" series, in which the icons of the East and West Wrestling scene are clashed.
The compositions of Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka's artists in Rhys Thomas' director act as a television production: drama of two Bucharest policemen from Romania's 80th century fighting for truth and atheism after the way Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - tough Gregor and idealistic Iosefa - play by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Ulici, which they recruited into the English language Channing Tatum (made producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as police watching chess on TV - parody on American football).
The series has borrowed its voice from many famous actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
The "Comrade Detective" is too focused on the impeccable propaganda drama, which includes the assassin with Reagan masks - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are not enough to get too angry and comedy moments.
With shorter tracers, propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US embassy, where two fat burgers gnaw at a large pile.
The message to the imaginary communist community is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The idea of Romanian creators was not wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes failed to cancel the IAAF start ban.
IAAF International Athletic Federation at London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian competitors due to the state supported doping program.
The vote at the stage of the world championship, which starts on Friday, was very clear as expected.
In order to extend the ban, 166 delegates were spoken, only 21 votes were against.
The main reason for rejection is that Russia is not able to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as the Head of the IAF Rune Andersen Special Investigation Group was expected before the Congress.
His group recommended that the prohibition continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspicious athletes have not yet been heard, and there are still trainers working in the country with a fucking reputation.
Even the Russian anti-doping agency RUSA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is fully operational.
RUSA may, however, already carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and British anti-doping agencies.
"Even though progress has been made, there is still still a lot of work to be done," said President of IAAF Sebastian Coe.
Russian athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost, among other things, the last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming MS, 19 Russians who have previously demonstrated that they have been tested beyond the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
At the championship they won't be able to start in national colors, and if they win, they won't play Russian anthem.
The Bank of England will pay interest rate to 0,25 %
According to the United Kingdom Bank, it is expected that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following insignificant economic growth and weakening inflation, which has led to speculation about sharp growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain "in the background" in relation to the maintenance of interest rates - despite the presiding of family budgets.
The political leaders of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the UK Bank voted six to two to maintain the interest rate of 0.25 %. The results of the vote for the increase in the interest rate supported the insignificant economic growth supported by a weak increase.
In its annual report on inflation, the Bank forecast growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction of family budgets would continue. The Bank expects inflation to increase to 3% in autumn.
The Bank also indicated that over the next few years there should be growth due to Brexit inflation and that rents should increase more on financial markets than expected.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of downloading part of the mom's package, which was the task of supporting the economy and which was put into practice one year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above mentioned above, the plan for timely financing, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks from next February, even though the Bank of England stated that it will now offer £15 billion less than the planned £15 billion.
Just before the decision was taken, the Bank stated: "MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (GDP) will, in short term, stand with pressure on real household income and consumption burden."
The Bank stated that it would need to drag money-policy bands to calm inflation more “to a higher extent” than to expect markets.
The markets currently predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the next increase in 2020.
However, the Bank noted that any increase would be "free" and "restricted".
The Bank reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year compared to 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May.
Expected growth in 2018 of 1,8 % remained unchanged.
After the publication of estimates, the pound dropped against the dollar and the euro.
The pound decreased by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and by 0.4% to 1.11.
The decision to maintain the current state came after a more disappointing increase buried the hope for further growth - GDP stopped to 0.3% in the second quartula compared to 0.2% of the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quartula, although, at the end of the year, it should be slightly increased by the bank.
The latest report on inflation is a slight consolation for households affected by rising inflation and poor pay increases.
The report further states that monetary policy can't stop income reductions in the coming years, but it is expected that wages will go up to the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also grow thanks to the great interest in British goods, thanks to the weak libra, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This decision came a year after the rate reduced to 0.025 % in August last year in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, resulting in a drop in the pound.
The Bank estimates that full harmonisation of prices and economies will last for at least four years.
Before the bank’s decision on the latest rates, many called for an increase in rates together with rising inflation, which was increasing pressure on households. Three political leaders demanded an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation last month fell back to 2,6 % of June 2,9 %, even though the bank said that the change had been expected and that inflation should rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the overrun relative to 2 % of the target was ‘total’ as a result of weak pounds.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage brokers, stated: “With regard to the recent fall of the swap rates, competition on the mortgage market will only rise as soon as creditors start competing for contracts with a view to a good view of the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who terminate the existing contract and remunerated mortgage - the option offered is free of charge, as well as the low rates which they obtain on the mill."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV to 10,000 patients
Patients will receive from September access to ‘transformative’ treatment for HIV prevention based on the decision of the Supreme Court on the financing of NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophyllaxis pill (PPP) that is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients up to 86 percent will be offered through the health service to some 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year, expressing that NHS had funding for PEP despite statements that the drug should finance local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was adopted by NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention” while National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as “a decisive moment”.
The clinics of sexual health in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Further clinics will be joined in October and until April 2018 they will be fully implemented throughout England.
Pre-posure prophylacis (PPP) is a HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that the PEP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV between patients at risk.
PrEP before sex means that in the patient’s body there are sufficient specific medicines to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
The patients tested include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics shall designate qualified participants who shall be subject to consent to participation in testing, including men, women, transsexual people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered in GPs in the UK can also sign up in their local sex health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The programme will come from taxpayers to £10 million and NHS England has signed a contract this week to distribute drugs after obtaining an international public contract.
The test period is proposed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PEP, its intention, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should be completed and fully exploited by constantly expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
He's another milestone in over thirty years' effort to stop one of the greatest challenges in human health.'
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: “We are witnessing the decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and in patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of a change in the English HIV epidemic.
The NSH will offer from September to patients exposed to a high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool, which is individually controlled and does not subject to the need to talk to a partner, leading to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We accept this declaration with pleasure.'
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust said: ‘The priority of number one must be the rapid deployment of tests throughout the country; we must ensure its availability to each patient.
We now have a PEP trial and we are on a good way to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV infection.'
Ms Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the PrEP test period is a welcome and long awaited change after months of suspension and retention by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this medicine can be part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The follow-up tests will lead us to a step closer to the full understanding of the PEP benefit.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible throughout the country and protect those who are exposed to HIV and, together, end the spread of HIV in society.'
High-foot life: interpatho and smart design have turned this little apartment into Earls Court in a spacious home
Joanne Leighová, a former banker with a passion for real estate, traded a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of Queen Anne's smart terrace - it is an excellent demonstration of modern design, which uses the maximum available space.
"I've lived with my ex-husband in a much bigger house in Knightsbridge before," Joanne said.
“I looked for something at a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same height of the ceiling.
I fell in love with him right away, and I was nosing on him the same day."
Since then, the apartment has passed 1000 square meters of complete renovation.
One-room apartment with complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add the fold space and the pre-set to take advantage of the high ceiling.
“I longed for high ceilings, big windows, and lots of light.
That's what I said," she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed design studios based in Notting Hill and used almost four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights to fit over two gaps - the challenge for architects was thus to create an intertwine on which to walk in adversity.
Erfan must have involved his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
“We had to organize both spaces so that we could walk uprightly.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but at the same time bend the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to construct two full rooms - and at the same time to add to dramaticness.
In the room looks at the beautiful living room old copper window frames in the design Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro mirror Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
Using mirrors plays an important role in dramaticity, space and lighting.
A short corridor is provided with mirrors on both sides and looks so much longer.
The mirror rail in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the front door there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors to store loads and greenhouses.
The advantage of the living room, which lends the entire apartment the impression of much larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if not used.
Glass kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution is a folding door.
“We had to solve the technical side,” says Erfan, about the tightened doors.
"The doorways are equipped with counterweight to be very easy."
Thanks to the smart use of the space and storage facilities, Joanne gained 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
“When it comes to it, what you sell is living space - or an appreciation of your property,” Erfan said.
"Real broker essentially calculates his price on the basis of the living area when he enters the apartment."
In this case, it managed to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials that lend the space a luxurious look.
"Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional connection with your home," Erfan added.
‘You do not love the power distributions in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts do not get."
As it turned out, quality design and increase of living space can turn the ordinary flat into an exceptional work.
And just like Joanne, you can decide to stay.
The United States is recognised.
The cultural and political gap between the blue states and the red is deepening.
California has declared a ban on travel of its citizens to the state of Tennessee and to seven other states.
The state of Tennessee paid her back and declared a rematch ban on his citizens' journey to California.
Of course, it is not a ban in the full sense that citizens of the United States can travel freely after all 50 states.
This is because California has forbidden to spend state money on the journeys of its citizens to eight other states, which are Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strong for LGBT and any expression of disapproval with the LGBT lifestyle considers it discrimination.
Tennessee, however, accepted a law of conscience, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with patient therapy from the LGBT community does not have an obligation to provide it, but has an obligation to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have again adopted laws according to which religious charities, which have received children from mothers after birth after adoption, do not have the obligation of these children to adopt the same-other couples.
Because of these laws, California's sole discretion prohibits the financing of its citizens' travels to eight states of the Union from its own resources.
In practice, this means that California's professors may not have travel to a scientific symposium, for example, in Texas, paid from their universities because they are co-financed by the State of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with financial support for their schools.
They must travel through to either federal grants, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the journeys of citizens from State A to State B, or private sponsoring.
The state of Tennessee has come to patience and its parliament has adopted a resolution that he also does not like California's policy of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits and tolerance for illegal immigrants, but still does not impose on California for it.
It supports them as a retribution for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union, which would order a similar ban on travel for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the fact, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is anti-consisting.
States have the right to adopt laws on the exclusive of conscience, as well as to decide what their money is and what they cannot do.
Second of all, what's wrong with your conscience?
If the butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why wouldn't he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why would he be forced to sell pork under sanctions when butchers offering pork are enough?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a fine, because he refused to make cake for a homosexual wedding.
But he also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him in peace and make the proper cakes not to settle for hundreds of bakers of others?
Thirdly, the beauty of the Federative System is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust domestic policies within the powers that are not federal, i.e. according to the preference of their citizens.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas, and seven other states are California too!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today many members of this community follow the rule of living and let live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists seek not tolerance against themselves and others, but about extreme intolerance towards others.
No one must ever display moral, religious or philosophical opposition to the LGBT lifestyle, and, if they do so, must be criminalised.
The minority of these activists is totalitarian.
They're new enemies of freedom.
In fifth, I don't know the situation in American history when the states, because of political issues, were so commended, except for one case.
Neither during the struggle for black people's civil rights, where North and West were on the side of integration and South on the side of the Segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 1950s of the 19th century, political bail was slavery, and the war against the North against the South came.
Of course, nothing like this is gonna happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the blue democratic states and the red republican states is deepening and the US is mentally remote.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critic got a greasy fine.
Russian opposition policies Alexey Navalnyj received a penalty of 300 thousand rubles for violation of the rules of the campaign against the presidential elections that will take place next year.
The court fined him for inviting people to attend illegal demonstrations.
In the last two months, he organised two major anti-government street protests and announced that in March next year, he wanted to apply for the post of the head of the state.
The head of Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but is generally expected to do so and to win again.
He said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He fined him for inviting people to demonstrate through videos placed on YouTube's website.
It's a total of three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them off the judge's salary," he was joking about Kremlin's critique.
The Russian electoral committee recently concluded that Navalnyi cannot attend the presidential elections because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
However, the aid that is considered to be a fighter against corruption considers the judgment to be politically motivated.
A total of 300 thousand rubles, including 25,000 rubles on Thursday, were also imposed by two members of the permanent electoral team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalnyj entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant personality at the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalny in all possible ways in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year sentence because he robbed Kirovles Forest.
In May, the verdict was confirmed by the appeal court.
The judgment is so powerful, which the insistent under Russian laws prevents the candidate.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the founding of their Italian family, drag over one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth over $500 million.
Former director Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides at the Toorak State, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who brought a dispute of common property and commercial property to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business already in 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly overtaken before the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna's own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, the first shop bought a family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
In this place the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain with 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company over $85 million.
The money was purchased by other properties and family portfolio De Lutis now includes offices, buildings in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments at Gold Coast and Mt Bullet and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one third of the assets of the company, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul's words, is a “significant driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two thirds of assets.
The court records say that Colin owns a property worth $316 million while Paul manages the property for $176 million.
For Paul, the problem has just become the distribution of assets and funds.
“Colin’s proposal sounded very much in my eyes for his benefit,” wrote Paul in a preliminary statement in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after a few failed attempts at reconciliation, the first meeting of the Supreme Court took place.
Now the brothers are also competing for who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to his statement, cut Colin off.
Colin resists the fact that this is not true and accuses Paul of mistreatment with certain properties.
In the previous location, Colin said that he believed in the seemingly solving of the conflict.
"My Italian background dictates that my family is the most important thing," he wrote.
The costs for the court stand rise. Hundreds of pages instead of direct statements, e-mails and reports from the company, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer flood the lawyers, including Allana Myers, QC and defence attorneys of both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought Brunswick’s depots in the 1970s.
For money acquired by stopping property they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “the last year of college, Paul was still a little, about 10 years old. ”
Anna De Lutis said that along with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to sons would take place.
“Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court” she wrote.
Another two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin said that Mark was compensated by $10 million in his departure and $26 million in part.
As Paul, Luke and Mark said, “they would not be satisfied with the conditions of their financial compensation.”
Colin has been holding back since then, despite the fact that he is a former member of the AFL Board, as Eddie McGuire, known for television personality and best friend Colin.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He only replied by means of a text message, in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute was dealt with before the court, “we do not deal with what to add.”
“It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the matter in court” he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of the statements at Colin Court, he said that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s requirements.
"Our father would be very unhappy if he had seen our current situation," he said, "he hoped for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hope was untouched.
"Our disputes will solve the trial early," Colin wrote.
The heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower babies.
The MHD drivers fax water and summer clothes.
At the school of Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now taking place, they go out only in the morning.
The school is after reconstruction and the planted trees do not yet provide a large shadow.
There's no swimming pool, but teachers shower their kids in the nebula.
The afternoon children remain in classes where the psalms and covered curtains are established.
Airs are trying to cool the air cleaner because they don't have air conditioning.
It is difficult for teachers and cooks as well.
"The temperature that is in the interior and exterior goes beyond the hygiene limits for the school, so we should not actually have open operation during this period," said Miloslav Makovičková.
In kindergarten, there is a glass corridor, where the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We wind up in the morning after 6 o'clock, windows close, and we have on the south side of the blinds we protect ourselves.
"But it won't be much," she added.
Better conditions are in the forest kindergarten Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where the children spend most of their time out there.
We have grown trees on the property, so we are beneath them.
"There's a beautiful fixture, there's a table underneath it, and there's things we do," wrote Barbor Komanová.
Teachers trying to go to the woods with their kids, where there's a bigger guy.
The children of the wet cap and on the program have different games with water.
"We have a hand pressure sprayer, which is used for flower sprays, and we use it to shower children," Kompana said.
Also the headmistress of kindergarten in Novoborská street on the Prague Proseku Jitka Vilimovská said that the teachers are trying to keep their children in the shade and take them with water.
"We have a relatively high garden, so they are there under the trees," she said.
Out this morning and then after 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a headgear.
Teachers also remind their children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, little chilled tea or diluted juice and have a drink with water in the garden.
Every day they also have vegetable salads and snacks always have fresh fruit and vegetables that parents sometimes bring to them.
"For today, one mother brought about a ten-mile melon for children," she added.
Drivers get water or summer uniform.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them in hot days with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms.
The drivers' cabs are trams and buses are also in most cases air-conditioned, said DPP spokesperson Aneta Řehková.
In addition to the cabins, some trams and passengers are air-conditioned.
Tram tracks high temperatures have not been seriously damaged yet.
A minor damage occurred in a loop in the Hostivar.
At current high temperatures, we are particularly concerned that drivers have sufficient drinks.
"Cold drinking water is available in all loops, shooting points and vehicles," said Řehková.
In wagons and in some places, employees have so-called sodobars, which produce chilled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use summer uniform to enhance the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," the speaker said.
The hot and dry weather of recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, the firemen in the whole Czech Republic destroyed 108, i.e. twice the daily average.
On Tuesday through the day when temperatures in the Czech Republic were climbing over 35 degrees Celsius, the fire department employed firemen mainly.
"They consider fires in the natural environment, as well as those associated with the harvest work," said Nicole Zaoral, spokesperson of firemen.
The relief of firemen did not bring the evening weather change, when the heat in many places was replaced by storms and tidal precipitation.
In relation to the storms, the firemen were driven to 236 hits.
It was mainly about removal of fallen trees and branches.
"The most affected in the Mediterranean region," continues Zaoralová.
But the fire department needed help in Stvolínky in Czechoslovakia, where they evacuated 60 people from the children's camp to safety because of the storm.
Throat temperatures have made work to Prague rescuers as well.
On Tuesday and night on Wednesday, ambulances were taken to ten cases of carbon dioxide poisoning with feed.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, warned the paramedics.
Carbon dioxide is a colourless gas with no odor, which is released in the case of imperfect combustion.
Signs of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and faintness.
In case of a suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infected room.
Trump's new Chief of Staff is planning to cut down President's media diet
Many tried it before him, and they always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, it'll be the first.
The Politico portal said that the White House's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information by President Trumpa - including news reports on television - in hope of keeping Trumpa on the surface.
Here's part of the report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“ When the new Chief of White House John F. Kelly met on the first day of office with employees, he outlined the key problem of Trump White House, which he intends to repair: the wrong information that comes to the President.
Kelly told the staff that he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or in speech - because the president can make a better decision on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have broken teeth on the control of Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now that he sits in the White House, his habit of watching television news is even stronger.
“If Trump was upset by honest reports as a candidate, it was useful to show him that he spoke about a lot of other media in a positive light, which was easier to convince," said the former campaign advisor for Politico Sam Nunberg in February.
Tara Palmeri from the Politico portal then wrote that “the key to keeping Trump's tweets on his arm - at least according to the words of six former organizers - is to ensure that Trump regularly follows the media that shouts for him.”
All right.
However, the idea that Trump's tendency to publish his views on Twitter was when "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something they don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more upsetting if someone didn't control them.
About the tweets that Trump never sent back, we will never, most likely never know.
If his employees managed to keep him at least several times in check, then their efforts did not go out.
However, no one has been able to stop Trump's regularly to raise controversial topics.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by subsidizing the materials - which they can but may not be reliable - which support their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the tendency of advisers to submit doubtful information to the head of the state.
This is an example of such information from the reporter Shane Goldmacher's pen:
“The current and former Trumpa officials say that the President has often responded very strongly to negative media reports, especially to information leak reports, and is seeking to find their origin.
This situation took place at the end of February, when someone planted a copy of the item from GotNews.com - Charles C. Johnson's provoktator website - that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the health of many leaks of information from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was always released from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not submit his claims with any evidence; or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later called them off.
Trump read the article and started asking Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary of the White House Rob Porter “was trying to implement the system for the administration and documentation of the information received by President Trump.”
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to enforce the same strategy.
Maybe he's a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsivity doesn't just disappear and his helpers are still competing for power.
These fixed factors of Kelly's mission will certainly make it harder.
Tourists are negotiating a raid and a return to “Milionary Quarter”
Several of the richest owners of home in the West Midland county are once again allowed to switch with determined tourists who negotiate with local authorities about the rights to regain the field for their residence.
The tourists parked 20 caravans in the field at the flourishing street in Solihull, which is known as the “millionaire neighborhood”.
When bringing horses, children, and army of caravans, tourists return after they were declared in May, neither did the moat which was dug up on the site under the regulations of the authorities in order to prevent their invasion.
A tactical group found gaps in defense and penetrated a field with caravans unprotected by a gap that served as a journey.
The inhabitants of the district have attacked the City Council of Solihull with the fact that ‘no one is able to solve the problem’.
One of the residents who wished to remain anonymously said to it: “They planted the place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones after other people.
The Management Board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All tourists were moved to another place, and now they're back.
Another one arrived last night, and there will be about more of them today.'
She added that : “Birmingham’s Board of Directors knows how to impose this problem. To protect the parks, he uses court orders.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I don't mean to pay any more taxes until the board of directors deal with tourists.'
Another anonymous citizen said to him: “It’s ridiculous, we’ve just watched the last away tourists and now they’re back.
And this time, there are even more, and this time, they brought horses.
Solihull spokesperson of Solihull said: “We are aware of an unauthorized stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the problem.
In order to collect as much evidence as possible, it is necessary for the local population to report any non-social or unlawful conduct of the police on heading 101.
We're going to get a general picture that we're going to bring to court.
The husband of the MEP hit a car in Brussels.
A government special brought him in.
The government special had delivered the wounded Róbert Žitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport, and on board the plane was under constant control of Slovak doctors.
The flight has been planned for a long time without complications.
Róbert Žitňanský reported that TV JOJ had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He's been hit by a car, and he's been in serious shape ever since.
After transporting to the country, he was transported to a specialised workplace of one of the bratislav hospitals.

Italians attach to the fight against the NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will avoid the arrival of emergency non-NGO ships arriving at the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean if the NGO does not sign new rules governing their operation.
"If NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to continue their operations," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in interview with Turin Daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after Italian authorities confiscated the ship's German rescue organization Jugend Rettet due to suspicion of trafficking in human beings, which significantly made illegal immigration easier.
The rescue organisation, which operates the first year, refused to comment on the whole matter because of the accusation by the Italian state prosecutor Ambroj Cartosios.
"For us it is and will always be the priority of the number one rescue of human lives, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in rescue zones at the moment," said the organization in the statement on social networks.
"All current charges can be commented only after the assembly of all information and assessment of the whole situation."
Italian authorities have been following Iuvent's ship Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of being transported by immigrants who have been handed over to them directly to traffickers with people, and repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place, according to the applicant's file, only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The meeting process was published by the Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of breaking the law and covering the Italian Coast Guard, who oversees rescue operations in this area - humanitarian enthusiasm rather than anything else.
The code of conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board a ship such as Iuventa to monitor activity.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have agreed to comply with the Code: Save The Children, Malta MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter organisation stated on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable as they do not constitute any "essential change or obstacle" in respect of rescue operations.
The adoption of the new Code of Conduct has, for example, rejected the organization of Doctors without Borders (MSF), which holds Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Minniti has heard that the sharp decline of immigrants in recent weeks, who are landing in Italy in rescue operations, suggests that the efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and to cooperate with local mayors bear fruit.
"We've been starting to see the light in the last days at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He also revealed plans for the next negotiations to take place this month with Libya's mayor on the subject of economic development initiative, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries leave in hope of achieving Europe.
Disgusting Mesaros: Silicon and cellulite were climbing from overalol!
The hot summer days are full of stuff, taking only the most necessary ones to cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesaros does it the other way around.
At the afternoon meeting at the Prague zoo, where it was actors, moderators, singers and all that had something to do with TV Prima, it was just fainting, her body covered into a mini overal.
And all she had was a couple of routine moves and a model to all showed her sills, but also her buttocks.
He overtaked it as many times as he did between the half, and he threw it so high that you had to fix it all the time.
The attention of gentlemen and present photographers was certainly not needed.
Michelle Carter sentenced to send text messages encouraging Conrad Roy's suicide
A woman from Massachussets was sentenced to taking liberty in the next two years for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will sit down for 15 months from the two-year sentence behind bars and then spend five years in parole.
Carter was convicted in June for the inadvertent killing of Conrad Roy, who married his own life on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s father said on Thursday at court: “The whole family is crushed.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision was taken.
She had been threatened with until 20 years of imprisonment, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and cream blouses, Carter stood to wipe out the judgment on the spot with tears in the eyes, with his hands spooked and eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the plaintiff told the judge.
“It ended his life to make her feel better.
She was unable to accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She had no regrets."
However, a lawyer named Carter said that they were “unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regretted.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “its age or their level of maturity or even mental illness had no significant impact on its conduct.”
The applicant read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “It will not run one day to grieve over the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and we will endure the great pain we will carry with us forever," he said.
Roy's sister, Camdin Roy, convinced her that she was “hunted ” by the fact that she would never participate in his brother's wedding and would never be the aunt of his children.
"The loss of man I have seen since my birth is the pain I will bear with myself for life," she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would involve a person who would help another person's suicide, so this case is based on a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in the car seat in 2014 poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the nation after Carter's text messages were published that stimulated suicide.
“It’s time to hang, jump out of the building or stab, I don’t care” wrote in the text messages which Carter sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on his family vacation.
A few minutes before his suicide, she wrote: "You must do it Conrad," and "just throw the generator and be free and happy".
Judge Moniz stated that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered any comments to be held in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who stood up on Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Ms. Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.”
Audi adjusts up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to a sharp response
Just a day before Audi's announcement, BMW's car manufacturer said he would offer customers an update of the software in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that society believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to the European cities - including Munich, which is based on BMW - which consider the ban or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would correct three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called for this decision as a withdrawal.
Europe's car manufacturers have promoted the large measure of the use of diesel automobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon dioxide emissions regulation.
However, nitrogen oxide, which emits diesel engines, is regarded as carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of automobiles for installing gas neutralising equipment issued by diesel engines, which makes car competitiveness less difficult.
While German car manufacturers are facing thorough inspections, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing accusations about spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which in their efforts to meet the emission limits installed software in their cars, which reduced the amount of emissions issued during the testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several higher representatives of Volkswagen were charged in the United States and others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, Germany would have arrested former thermodynamics manager of the automotive development department in Audi.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and therefore does not apply to extradition, so he can face a court trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi became involved in the criminal investigation of the German police in the matter of Car Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing the system, which was supposed to circumvent European emission limits - and so extended the charges that Audi is facing in the US.
The inclusion of Audi's car into the investigation may have an unbleached impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
An emergency plane landed on the beach.
A man and a girl perished.
The accident occurred on the beach Praia de São João in the Costa da Caparica area, approximately 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the SIC's witnesses said that the plane flew right before landing, right over the people that sunbathed on the beach.
Some people from the beach reportedly fled from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machines.
A 50-year-old male and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach by the local media.
"The plane hit them, and they were dead on the scene," described local chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not known yet.
There were two people aboard the plane, both of them removed alive from the accident, and the cops took them for questioning.
D11 or how to stop the freeway.
And are motorways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a puzzle.
It's out of date, even when it started building in 1978.
Even if it's out of date, it gets fixed all the time.
And it can't happen anymore, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, D11 castle highway.
The construction of the next section has stopped the Children Earth movement for at least a few months.
We Easterners get a highway in pieces, like when the salami cuts.
There's gonna be a wheel falling down, and then we'll just see when, and if we even get another one.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten driving time, and we want to get a truck heading to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
The endless currents of the truck are going right through the city of Jaroměl or Náchod, which is not like going around wisely.
But so far, the last part of our dreamy highway was operated in 2008, i.e. invincible nine years ago.
Not even a knock ever since.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of the unfinished section began to build recently to Hradec Králove and at other sections to Jaroměři began with archaeological research by building at the end of this year, you could hear the loud banging of spies in the eastern Bohemia.
I mean, no one ever believed it.
Last week, it turns out it's not gonna be up this year.
And maybe next year.
The movement of children of the Earth-Klub for sustainable transport from Brno has been decompositioned.
Children Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They attacked decisions on construction permits in the whole range.
In the decomposition, any binding opinions of all the authorities concerned shall be reviewed.
For example, the castle masteret, the Ministry of the Environment, as well as the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Office.
So so far we drive from D11 near the village with the eloquent name Pohřebačka.
So we're going down, we're just going up the highway, and suddenly we're standing on the side of the road, and we're preferred to go into the column after that.
The worst part is that you see similar stories throughout the Republic.
Scary, constantly blocked road to Benešov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their Funeral.
What do the children of the earth demand?
What is the essence of the problems of communication construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is it virtually incompatible in the current motorway network?

Levandule from Provence threatens climate change
Levandule has become a symbol of Provence in the south-east of France, but now they are threatened by climate change.
Levandulí remains due to dry climate and harmful insect, causing dismay on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert in the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The lavender growing in Provence is at risk, because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change that brings fewer precipitation in spring and autumn.
That's what's affecting the life of the lavender.
They also have their guilt on this, and the locusts that carry the micro-bacteria, which are in the dry climate."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil that is made of them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The cities of long and beautiful flowers grow smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
The quantity of oil obtained from these lavenders is clearly smaller."
Possible solutions may be more effective distribution of water and slowdown of water from the soil, but also spraying lavenders protected by clay and water, and breeding of more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of journalists highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the Riodace weekly regularly meet on Wednesdays to discuss the concerns that are taking place in the area of Sinaloa with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials and unscrupulous drug wars.
But today, in support of recent events, it is mainly due to its own safety.
They find it important to change their habits.
Two deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: to take their children with them to the office that someone attacked or left them at home in 2009.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutral and ally.
They ask journalists to give names to each word - no evidence is needed, it is enough to use imagination and prejudice.
Picking them for what - drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a list of criminals whose task is to cover crime.
The violence does not stop, and the bodies are growing up at mass across the country; journalists among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journals, there are at least 25 of them from President Enrique Pen Nieta's accession to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are protected under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven of them were killed this year in all seven states.
Among them are the co-founder of the Riodioce periodical, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His loss is delicious, although his presence is all-presenting - a large picture of Valdez with the inscription “Justice”, shown by the middle-viewer, hanging in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - age over 30 years, have a T-shirt with photos of Valdez with a smile on their face, glasses on their nose and Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists speak of mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to address the case of journalists, two suspects were sued by the Committee on the Protection of Journals.
Most of the thousands of murders that happen every year are linked to drug trade and organised crime, and the murderers of journalists get to court so exceptionally.
The reporters in Riodoce insist on informing about the violence that is happening in Sinaloe; even though they are destroyed by grief and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without any information on the infractions and without a sight of justice, a safety meeting is meaningless, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time for such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, we can't trust anyone."
On 15 May Valdez left the headquarters of Riodoce in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to take off several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently due to the name of the article - which can be translated as the Twelve River.
The shooters then got into his car, and close to the crime scene, they hacked him.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left a woman and two grown children behind.
The rumors seem to be spreading rapidly in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, it is up to suspicious silence.
Since last year's arrest, Guzman and his January edition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battles of the country, as the rival faction attempts to fill an empty place.
A few people were killed in the streets of Sinaloi every day, and the cemetery is full of experimented two-story mausoleia for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget about the moment that the word “direction” means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes that travel to the United States of America by drugs.
Navzdor, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodock still affects his friend not to protect him.
They believe that two doubts have contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels, which led the war with the sons of Joaquín Guzman.
He could have upset his sons; the suspects bought all the copies of the paper at the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper was seized, in which the same story was left.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and on his death he is seen as an important milestone in fighting Mexican criminals against journalists.
He lived so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed he would never change.
In Noroeste's periodical, he was practically vetted when he decided to sell his shares worth $50 in 2003 and to start with five colleagues in Riodoce.
In Sinaloe, “it was impossible to operate a newspaperhouse and not to mention drug trafficking," Bojorquez said.
Riodace gained a good reputation over time for brave and true intelligence; the newspapers began to succeed.
The reporters were happy to search for problems and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after the foundation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for a report on Latin America.
The same year Valdez won the International Freedom Award to the Press Committee on the Protection of journalists for his brave reporting on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez admitted openly that he was scared.
"I was afraid for my life," he said when he received the prize.
The drug trade in Sinaloae is a "time of life", said Valdez in October last year in an interview for Rompeviento TV.
“You must take the role of a journalist - or play the stupid one.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What were you doing face to face of death... why didn't you say what was going on?"
He was a good friend who loved giving advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all depended on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar across from the offices and sat at the same table.
They ask now: Has this routine caused his death?
His death in them also raised questions about her own assumptions - how to do her best to stay alive?
“They don’t like having their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas.”
"These things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
As a result, there are high levels of self-esteem and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something's wrong here, hands off.
The problem is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "it's the sense that can be fooled... and then it happened with Javier."
The old rules according to him, as according to others, in Sinaloae no longer apply - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to the toxic mix of speculative smuggling trails, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The country is constantly changing.
There are no mobile phones in the room where Riodace employees meet; a few days ago spyware was discovered, which was bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief from 40 degrees heat in the shadow of the nearby tree.
They were chosen by the State to protect the Riodoc office, located in a four-story building in Culicacan, the city of Culiacan.
The reporters are clinging to whether these cops aren't among the 50 percent of the law enforcement officers who are corrupt by the government.
It's been months since journalists last went to hot areas that basically control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the program this week.
The first is the murder of a brother of the former boxer Julio Césara Chávez in Sinaloe.
They are also lit up on suspicious government expenditure that took place in the home town of the Governor of the State.
There have recently been several kidnappings in one of Culiacan's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the U.S. Attorney's office.
Officially, no one announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were careful to write about what each resident of the city knows: that the restaurant is the favorite destination of drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist reported from public records that the restaurant was registered on behalf of which it was associated with a certain politician, who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlled by all levels of political scene almost throughout the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with corruption at high posts.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about the earlier incidents that occurred at the restaurant, including the incident in which one of the sons of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmana escaped the military intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would read on this subject in Valdez's column, which was the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly break the case," said Villarreal (46) who reads "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs to us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest against the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect them to become activists in the representation of the press.
The reporter, Miriam Ramirez, fell down several signs and went to demonstrate herself in front of the U.S. Attorney's office this morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michigan.
The authorities say it's Adamea based on DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is moving around the country. Many of them organize protests and die on sidewalks and buildings “SOS Print”.
The director of Bojorquez's daily visit to Washington, where he tries to gain international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, which took place the day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their murders for telling the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked for a transfer to another department of concern that her anger might endanger her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that myxical journalists were “beginning” organized crime, corrupt officials, and indifferent public.
In his last book "Narco-Journalis" wrote that journalists die not only of drug cartels, but also to order politicians and security forces that cooperate with organized crime.
Articulo 19 media supervisory group accused more than half of all attacks on journalists and public officials.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you," she added.
The murders are obviously working.
No one forgets the death of a blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with a note that apparently signed the Zetas cartel: “This is what I ended for my report.”
Next to the severed head, there was a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches decided to end their activities, such as El Norte, based on the northern border of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslava Breach.
The others are still continuing, just like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after they killed their director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez approached the public drug cartels on the opening page of “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, just like getting rid of the feeling that you're constantly being chased.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, such as in Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015, together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, each day represents a great risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be one poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is heading to hell, which is why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midnight and Riodoce's employees are sitting on the sidewalk outside the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when suddenly the phone starts ringing.
They find that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and policemen near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is moving, just like it promised many messages left in this area by the members of the syndicate.
The reporters publish this news from their mobile phone on the Riodace website.
There will be no one day and the title will change again.
The sound of police sirens point to another shooting.
Bojorquez throws a lety look at the police patrol to see if they're careful.
If they're scared, they don't show up.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middleman is an eloquent slogan for the entire Sinaloe - all Riodoce employees follow his steps.
"How could we think of leaving," said Bobovorquez, "when the same day that Javier was killed, one intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
The dinosaurs used the façade to avoid the enemies
At first sight, it looks like a statue, however scary.
Researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first finding of an amazing creature with the size of a rhinoceros whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called ‘Mona Lisa dinosaurs’ - found the Canadian miner.
The remains were maintained to such a high extent that experts could determine the red brown color of his scaly skin and said that dinosaur had a “problem past”.
The article in the Current Biology magazine stated that it was “the most highly preserved still found armored dinosaurs and one of the best dinosaurs in the world.”
The fossil is a new species of the Nodosauridae family. Dinosaurus lived in the Křída period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition shocked the researchers who described him in the words “reasonably remarkable.”
The armored white shark is still the best preserved fossil of its kind according to National Geographic.
It is behind the find of Shawn Funk, who exposed the fossil on March 21, 2011 when drilling down the Suncor Millenium near the Canadian Alberta.
He ran into something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from a huge piece of land with a weight of 1100 kg.
After the job is finished, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
“It’s time to make eyes easier and believe that they sleep,” said the head of the Job Caleb Brown and the natural scientist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
‘It will certainly be written into history as one of the most beautiful and seasoned kinds of dinosaurs - Mona Lisa dinosaurs.’
By studying his skin researchers found that this bulldog - despite being covered by armor and resembling walking tank - was likely to face a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavy armored dinosaur used red and white rubber to protect its predators and use a masking system that uses many of today's animals.
Experts claim that it enabled him to better blend with his surroundings and avoid enemies. Masking system suggests that he was the favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
News about 110 million years of old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspaper in May. Currently available to see the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name Borealopelta Markmitchel after the technique of the Museum Mark Mitchell, which, along with the team, spent more than 7,000 hours of careful discovery of fossils.
Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document the patterns and shape of the barrel and armor all over the body thanks to the amazingly preserved state of Fosil.
They discovered a method of masking commonly used by these animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the findings of researchers are surprising, because Borealoplet's size is far beyond the present animals using the same technique.
It is possible, therefore, that dinosaurs were so many predators that evolution gave the priority to masking before confrontation in survival.
Many present masking animals - including deer, collection and/or belting - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, indicating that nosodourus must have fought for his survival literally.
“Prevention of a huge and hard armored dinosaur reflects the dangers posed by predators during the wings,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic components contained in the hams also revealed that dinosaur skin probably had red brown discoloration.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for other knowledge of his life, including the preserved stomach contents, to track down his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea, where it sank on the bottom.
In Alberta, at that time, the climate was the same as in today's Florida and the rivers and oceans went far further into the inland than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in the fact that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and at the same time preserved in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,” said Brown.
‘For these reasons, the animal looks practically as much as in the time of the chalk.
You don't need to use your imagination to rebuild it; just make sure you get your eyes a little easier and it seems like you're just sleeping.'
In the wings of the Earth, the giant teropods, the carnivorous dinosaurs, who were moving on two legs.
Although king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could be the favorite of his equally horrific ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 11.5 metres long monster with a weight of over 6 tonnes.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in the Current Biology magazine believe that Borealophelt's body was flooded into the sea after it was mummified in the mud.
It is behind the find of Shawn Funk, who exposed the fossil on March 21st 2011 when drilling at the bottom of Suncor Millenium near Canadian Alberta.
According to the museum, this is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is also complete from the jaw to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 metres and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two hundred inches [50 cm] was removed from his shoulder.
The researchers believe that this herbivore has engulfed the territory of today's Canada until it ends in the river that flooded it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fosil remains of this kind are also preserved to the extent that armored canvas around the skull still covers the remaining skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “a view of the person that is being preserved can be compared to the prize of the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking find seems to me.
Fosil remains of this kind are also preserved to the extent that armored canvas around the skull still covers the remaining skin.
On his side lies his right foot with the fingers pointing upward.
I'll easily count the drawers on his feet.'
How did one activist know the answer to the question: “Who Streets?”
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaking all over the body.
The day after she arrived in New York, the native of St. Louis sat on the bed in Airbnb's room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
She hit some high school student's contribution.
"The police just shot a 18-year-old young man whose body is still lying on the street," it said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah kept retweeting her wall contributions.
Rapper of St. Louis published on Twitter his contributions on Michael Brown's death, an unarmed 18-year-old young man who was shot by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photograph of Brown's body, where he was lying helplessly on the street, where no one took it after four hours.
"This is crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She gave up her phone to go back to him the night she was watching tweets about the people who were gathering at Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held the sign "Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son" in his hand!
She followed live reports - one of the officers stood before a group of protesters, holding a clue in his hand and at the other end of a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, as she said, held a gun in his hand, aimed at the crowd and shouted: "I will kill you all animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrell said.
“ This is not the kind of murder we used to call normal.
I could feel goose bumps all over my body.
"I was angry and cried."
She immediately booked her return flight and traveled home the second day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson during the next three years describes the new document “Who Streets?” which will be published in the cinema on August 11th.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and opposition, strength and indifference told from the point of view of the people living in the community who go out into the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell dialogue with her daughter was introduced - dressed in flower drama and the same flower family - about the topic which they had discussed many times before - “on experience with black people”.
"Do you remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalls the interview.
"We're just going to Ferguson right now because the police killed a 18-year-old young man, and that's not right."
"It was not considered that I would not take it with me," Ferrell said later.
“ Today’s events are a culmination... that occurred in the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grew up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to know the difference between different layers of experience with black people and what we had to do to free ourselves.
Even though I am able to ensure the conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own, she does not differ in any way from another black child's wife.
I feel like if I could protect her from this experience, I'd just hurt her."
After arriving in Ferguson, she was the first stop of South Florissant Road across the street from the police department to become the base activists who were expecting the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his possible participation in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and his daughter met the local entrepreneur who prepared for the rest of the meal.
Together, they prepared food for the sachets and helped him spread it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, he slowly born a new type of activism.
"My activism turned upside down after 9 August," said Ferrellová and added that during her studies at the University of Missouri-St. Louis she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn Association and sought to introduce health care and food in the Black Communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with the co-director of the document during the evening demonstration, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrrar wanted to “document only” the ongoing events.
But Ferrell thought: “Do you work on a document or are you trying to find a story that could be used? ”
Such skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to make a difference in pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We have heard that the voices of people who are born and growing up in Ferguson are very often forgotten and we wanted to change this.”
Folayan has already established cooperation with co-director Damon Davis, who is a well-known local artist who deals with prisoners in death row.
His participation in the project was also visited by Ferrell and along with other six local residents, who followed the team “Who Streets?” in the years following the murder of Brown.
"In this document no one speaks for us, but it is our statement," Davis said.
“It was important to me - as these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented.”
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in order to show that the movement “is not about the savior leaders, but on the closerness of the community," said Folayan - proved to be the most open to the participation in filming.
The documentary “Who Streets?” describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face when she thought at the first moment when she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understand that I have to open up to this job and police the blacks."
Furthermore, Ferrell's story highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the wider aspect of Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to killing Teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves weirdos.
“The black eccentric women at the leading positions finally stand behind the preservation of the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on more fronts.
Black and Central Women must endure the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this expression and adds that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of middle black women.”
However, it insists that "this is not a mere and rational matter" and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of his opinions.
"It was the driving force and the energy source," she said.
“ that she just found herself in the front lines is not a coincidence, because life on these intersections in the skin of a black strange woman is dangerous.
You feel that energy attack in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the TV stations have cleared their positions, but the heavy racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year parole for blocking the highway at demonstrations.
Socially political atmosphere in the area called home described as "The Order."
Still, she does not stay in her efforts, to which she has been committed since she went off to Ferguson Street three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we have to lose is our chains."
There was a field burning in Cologne.
Ten firemen went to the scene, helped the helicopter.
Near České Brod in Kolínsk, between the villages of Wasna and Liblice, it burned since 14:00 a field of about 15 hectares.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, the fire department declared a third degree of fire alarm from four possible.
According to Ladislav Holomčík's spokesperson, fires from the air helped to fire a helicopter.
At 6 p.m., the fire was able to extinguish the fire, and the fire caused a damage of 700,000 crowns.
There were dozens of professional and voluntary firemen fighting with flames on the scene.
The fire was caused by a technical failure in the engine space of the combine harvester.
Hasit also helped a helicopter that made six shots of water.
"We handed over the place of intervention to the owners until 8:00 tomorrow," said Holomčík today.
A Becoming Resemblance: Artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning DNA
On the center of one of the rooms of New York Fridman Gallery is placed several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and snow - suspended from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them looks like the previous one fell out of the eye.
All 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the swabs from her oral cavity and the hair that Chelsea Manning sent her.
Manning's samples were sent from Fort Leavenworth prison, where she was serving her former analyst 35-year-old sentence for unauthorised publication of secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, launched on August 2nd, bears the name A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines his experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning - a transgender and pioneered dissident whose punishment reduced Obama three days before his departure from the post of President of the United States.
The algorithmic analysis of DNA Manning and the use of 30 portraits to illustrate what a human with this genotype would look like, created Dewey-Hagborg's brittle, if not an intellectual comment on the subjectivity of DNA - as well as on many ways that DNA can be interpreted - and the inseparable determination of these interpretations as well as identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, spoke of being considered a woman since youth. She was sentenced in 2013 on the basis of 20 charges, including violation of six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were kept by the staff of the prison. Only one black and white photograph of lower quality, on which Manning, visibly concerned, sat on the driver's seat in platinum blonde wig, with which it is now connected.
In 2015, a positive reaction to the Dewey-Hagborg 2012 project Stranger Visions continued.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic articles - such as cigarette and gum bats - to create a picture of possible forms of these people.
And right now, she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They wanted an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to supplement the article with a portrait," said Dewey-Hagborg on the occasion of the opening of a new exhibition.
Visitors and photography were not allowed, but they turned to Chelsea and asked if she was interested in DNA portrait.
The artist and her trapped muse were friends in two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic called Supported Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented the vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could take part in the exhibition in person.
Indeed, President Obama asked for the release of Manning for several days after the release of the comic book, which was a welcome change after several inlerable years in Kansas's military prison.
It is interesting, indeed, that the exhibition takes place at the time when Donald Trump runs a war with people who seek to publish government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to stimulate their tweets in areas to support.
In response to the question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that “all things are happening for a reason.”
Under a statement by an artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with his huge signature (the letter “i” in the surname is evicted by his heart) after the end of the “self-fascility, founded on sex, race, sexuality and culture”.
The sequence of her mitochondrial DNA is located on the opposite side - a set of letters C, G and A recorded with a pencil.
By classifying 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary artist), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least after a biological point, we all were.
“I hope people will take it from this that our genome does not matter who we are, and that genetic data are subjective and everyone can interpret them after," Dewey-Hagborgová said. Her vision is also her work Spurius Memories from 2007 on the video theme.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last version of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above graphic amendment.
It shows Manning, how he emerges from King Kong's United States Disiplinary Barracks with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as you are prevented from speaking, they win," she writes.
"Don't ever be quiet."
"This is a direct transcript from one of the letters," said the Finnish artist.
"When I think about it, it's giving me the creeps."
Manning's exhibition has not personally visited - which was foretold in comic - but when it does, it will be welcomed in the center of the room with their masks, its own genetic resemblances, sorted as a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including almost 160 cm high statues of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroup was recorded.
"In the past they were placed on walls, but this time I wanted them to hear the feeling of the crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg about portraits.
“I wanted to give the impression of mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and frees it.”
Professor of the Sevezpad University and staff of Oxford University looking for murder
These days, a national search for professor of the Sevezpadal University and staff of Oxford University, who are tried for suspicion of murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment, was reported by the police.
On Monday, an arrest warrant was issued for the murder of first-degree men named Wyndham Lath (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, reports the Cook County trial.
It says in the document that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several stab wounds.
The Chicago police said that the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
Police were informed about this fact by phone after their arrival at Grand Plaza Apartments they found a victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead and the detectives investigate the case as a murder, while the police are looking for both suspects, put the authorities in place.
He worked for years at the position of Professor of Microbiology and Imunology of the North West University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of the University of Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was forbidden to enter the school premises of the University.
"The whole issue is now being examined by the relevant authorities and the North West University fully cooperates with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
The University spokesperson and Somerville College stated in the statement sent by e-mail: “We were contacted by the British police and we were ready to assist the US police.”
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues have been shocked by the facts and wish to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of contact with the Chicago Police Department's public, said he was calling on the suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
"Police has information about the location of their stay and the attempt to investigate suspects is moving," Guglielmi said.
Gulelli added that local, regional and national authorities helped to investigate suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, which was alerted to the events to which it was supposed to take place in apartment no. 1008.
The police described the scene as being very violent.
Guglielmi stated that it is not clear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
He added that Lath and Warren were caught with security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The leadership of Grand Plaza gave a statement to all residents: “Police is currently working to build a time overview and profile of the victim and investigates various motives, including domestic violence.”
"In the early future, we will complete the WADA plan" - Vice-President of the Russian Government Mustko
Vice-President of the Russian Government Vitala Mutko stated that it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
‘At the moment, part of the new plan criteria has already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and testing in cooperation with the UK Antidoping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan was updated," said Mutka on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the website of the organisation.
According to Mutka, the Code does not contain anything that Russia should be concerned about.
“Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the above criteria calls after a public announcement of the outcome of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, on the alleged sponsorship of Russian athletes by the government.
On this topic, Mukko said: “We are investigating, because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
It was added to any measure.
But there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot admit something that never existed."
Mutk's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
In an interview for Russian RSport Smirnov, he admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but added: “On many occasions, we said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the message without any reservations," finished Smirnov.
WADA suspected RUSADU from carrying out doping checks within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation allowed planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit from the Moscow headquarters of the organisation in July, Director General WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was on the right path to renew its validity.
Police charge three people, one of them's juvenile.
The police charged three men with the establishment of a central fire for a rare wooden church in Třinci-Gutech in Frýdecko-Místeck.
One defendant is juvenile, all three are Czech nationalities.
They've been threatened for a criminal offence of death for up to 15 years in prison.
The journalists told Moravskoslezský police director Tomáš Kužel today.
He thought it was a deliberate crime.
"It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," Kužeel said.
He said the police would discuss possible arrests.
Further information by the Director cannot be published.
"Well, I can't tell you yet, because criminals and investigations and prosecutors are really working on things," Kožel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech dates back to the 16th century.
He was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
Mass damage will go from preliminary estimates to tens of millions of crowns, but historical loss is incomparable.
The weights of the fire began to reflect on the restoration of the church.
Most of the costs should cover the insurance policy, another cost is ready to share the Ministry of Culture and the city, also a public collection is being prepared and counted with the contribution of the owner of the monuments, i.e. local parishes.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrab also destroyed fire 15 years ago.
That's when the electrical failure caused it.
In his place was then a thorough copy.
The state counts with citizens defending the state.
They'll support their training.
With financial support for societies used in the defence of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the substantive intention of the law on the preparedness of citizens to defend the state is calculated.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been given the task of the government, promises from the government that it will manage to increase the physical efficiency of the Czechs and their ability, which could then be used by the State in crisis situations.
It comes out of a draft prepared by the Ministry.
If the law had been adopted in the future, the state would have spent hundreds of millions of crowns in support of the brandy.
The basic objective of the proposal is, according to his authors, to create an effective system that would help to increase the preparedness of the Czech citizens to defend the state, beyond the performance of the duties taken and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the State would financially or financially support the associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would allow them to increase their members' ability.
In return, he would receive data on people willing to come country during a crisis to help and their abilities or material equipment if needed.
There could also be accredited instructors, who would also help the association and other interested parties in training or training.
It is also counted with organizing beers with war veterans or people who have been heroic.
One of the possible variants assumes that a new office should be established in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and that the State would use their capacity once the status of the threat is declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual prosecution of previously apparent borders between the different types of threats," states the intention to refer to the dangers of the so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting as wide a range of abilities as possible, not just military.
"The primary aim is to create a very wide base that will allow each citizen to respond to a situation that threatens the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, protect himself, or contribute to the protection of others, and not to burden them with the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic," says the intention.
The adoption of the law would bring little financial claims.
According to the Ministry, their height will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Authority foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens for state defence up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost about CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that it would have to expand the scope of the Regional Military Command to employ further 42 soldiers.
The Ministry’s representatives have already stated that the law should also help to resolve the disapproval of some Czech politicians with the introduction of a directive of the European Union on weapons possession.
It would allow shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons that the Directive provides for.
Startups that help your company not to become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of satisfaction of the employees of her e-commerce startup, but she did not find a proper survey.
The answers were often inconclusive, inefficient, or even misleading.
And although she promised anonymity research, some employees expressed their distrust throughout the process.
"I looked for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of the e-commerce company of the hair care company Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, employing 75 people.
She therefore requested outside aid.
New startups from the human resources sector are constantly emerging in the market, helping companies to explore the satisfaction of employees.
By creating and licensing software with a specific intention of measuring employees' duties, companies can make quick votes, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offers anonymity of employees and a hot link to file complaints, and in some cases they also allow informants to bypass the superiors and contact directly the director.
“There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that follow your medical condition, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Glint startup, based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that Glint had gained greater awareness in three years of what her employees felt and how they felt.
In addition to quick surveys and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a thermal map of society and a comprehensive overview of groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-quality managers - which allows users to work on the axle.
Companies begin to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment - in case another Uber is made of them - which is rejected in the scandals after the former employee published a post on his blog describing the company's environment and harassment of employees who dared to speak openly.
For startups like Glint poses demand for corporate culture surveys, a lucrative business opportunity.
According to Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and consistency industry can exceed $ 118.8 billion by 2020.
The startup Converterent in Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, has seen a small increase in interest and activity in the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandal.
Among almost 600 clients of Convertentu include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber accepted under his wings.
Like Glint, Convertent allows companies to send customized “blend” surveys, collect confidential information in real time and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text line that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints shall be sent directly to the Governing Board.
"The Court of Justice has authorised regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the Convercent startup.
If the company is convicted of mistreatment with its employees or non-ethical behavior - and if the regulators do not proceed - it can face costly consequences due to customer boycott, exhaustion of employees or judicial proceedings, Quinlan added.
The network of Ruby Tuesday restaurants, which employs more than 25,000 people across 500 locations, uses the Convertercent to increase the awareness of employees on corporate principles and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate management.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to monitor the telephone number or email on the company's management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful solution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Deputy General Ruby Tuesday, according to which there was no previously reliable way of monitoring complaints from employees.
Now that the company uses Convercent, it is ensured that there are quick detection and resolution of problems that have never been brought to managers sitting in offices, a mile away from the real solution of complaints - including discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
“This is the case for a Dutch, overall view of the experience of employees,” said Vitrano, who runs a group of Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"We also protect shareholders from civil disputes by employees."
The companies stopped taking ethics, value and participation of employees at ease in 2002, after Arthur Andersen’s accounting company collapsed after Enron’s fall in the case of the abuse of employee ethical rights, said Quinlan.
But only when “the social media has lightened on the whole matter” the society has become aware that in the online world they cannot simply hide their skeletons in the closet.
“Two before people began using themselves to monitor technology ethics, they relyed on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Convertercent offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by courageous capital investors who supported both startups.
Converter chose, as part of his February campaign, from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital overall $10 million, and finally he took the capital of $47 million.
Glint won $10 million from Bessel Venture Partners in November and won $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, cultures and risky capital.
The growing number of research confirms that today’s employees expect more than ever from their workplace.
And on competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, they are not the main advantage of high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a society that strives for a positive mission.
“If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they seek the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, Vice President of the global benefit and employee benefits of LinkedIn, which uses Convertercent and Glint.
Investors make money if companies and companies prosper if they are satisfied with their employees.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure commitment and commitment of employees to the company, there is no wonder that there are many investors who support this effort.
Experts say it is important to have employee satisfaction data.
But the data itself are ineffective if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that as soon as a company asks for feedback from its employees, major changes can occur.
And if the change doesn't happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest of employees.
"As soon as you ask for 4000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of advice at the company Kotter International, who witnessed many companies that were too relying on the data itself.
“Because when things don’t go to the end, employees start asking themselves: ‘Did they hear me at all?
Is he interested in me?
And if not, then why should I care?"
Madison Reed, who is currently conducting a survey of employees every month, will be able to solve the problem by one day, said Errett.
After the assembly of feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganise several teams within the company and start communication training to solve the problem as a result.
Ruby Tuesday gets a very important view of his employees and hopes that from a long-term point of view, he will achieve high employment in the field known to be frequent redundancies.
"If you do not seek to create a transparent work environment, employees will not trust you," added Vitrano.
“And once you lose your employees, you lose your customers.
And the entire company is failing with the flow of customers."
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday is with 38.3 degrees recorded in The Watchtower in Hodoninsk still the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
He overcame Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37,3 degrees.
The Czech hydrometeorological institute staff informed about this.
On Thursday, compared to Tuesday, but there were not many heat records.
Vedra hit most of Moravia, in Bohemia was mostly clouded.
On Tuesday, the records were exceeded or settled to 35 out of 145 meteorological stations for over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
Perhaps today's Watchtower was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice in Břeclav, today’s 37.4th degree exceeded the original maximum of four-tenths and in Pohorickéch in Brno the current 37.1th degree exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as well as the Watchtower, came from 2013.
High temperatures today appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice was the greatest heat in Dyjákice in Znojsk and Broda nad Dyja in Břeclav, where mercury reached 37,8 degrees, but the record did not complete.
On the other hand, for example, in Western and northwest Bohemia, according to the ČHMÚ website, the highest temperatures today were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The heats started to grow there until now later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually flow off according to ČHMÚ and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
At most Morava places, however, will remain high temperatures still on Fridays and in the south-east of Moravia even on Saturdays.
We've got a lot of dirt going on here.
Billionaires don't get the same vote in elections as any single man in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not all of them are as different as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Penty Marek Dospiva's owner, along with other colleagues behind the water of Martin Burdou and Antonín Fryč, sponsors Robejškovy Realisty.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance and business in real estate by Pavel Sehnal, who is also his party to the President.
Ivo Valenta's convicted corruptionist and king of Czech gambling has taken over the Party of Private People.
The political movement of Agrofert, as Andreje Babiš failed to name off the cross-country mayor Jaroslav German, is a chapter for himself.
The Mayors have recently caught their billionaires.
It's the Dalibor Grandpa, the owner of the company's security device at Jablotron.
According to his own words, he enters into politics to do good.
Entré in the mayor's dressing room didn't really work out for his grandfather.
"I've never seen little targets," he said at the press conference.
That means my goal is to make the ANO movement gain 20 percent in the election.
Leckdo bit.
The child’s extension is rather pronounced.
Billionary Dalibor Grandpa is a man of solid opinions.
Although he intends to apply for votes by voters in the Mayors' dressing, Andreje Babiš continues to support.
The grandfather Babish supported in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a tributary speaker and does not control the promising rhetoric of political snakes," wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
But he certainly doesn't go into politics because he wants to get better personally.
Babish will remain a hero to me.
He's willing to step out of his world, which is under control, and to do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new strength, he learned from his admirer about Babish again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn how to work with Babish.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his mind and stands for his own regardless of what kind of uniform he is wearing.
Others can speculate whether Babish is sending his bee to the Mayors to build someone as immeasurable as this.
Others may ask whether, perhaps, the head of Jablotron did not partake of the evil in the shop and seek no other way to defend his rivals.
But the first grandfather's public appearance didn't just turn around Babis.
Grandpa promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayors.
And he says if they need more money, he'll send more.
A few years ago, it would hardly have been over who stopped saying so.
In fact, a court-appointed gauner, Zdeněk Bakala, before the 2010 elections, cast millions on all sides.
The political division of the security agency Vita Bárty, TOP 09 and the citizens' Democrats came together like this at nearly thirty million.
But today is another time.
The law prohibits any political party to give more than three million.
Now that Grandpa enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe you wouldn't have to ask yourself why politics has such a bad reputation.
He then crowned his first days in politics Grandpa with a proposal for tax benefits for families with study children.
People with higher education will come to our house for about 50 grand a month.
The basics of less than 20.
A man with fifty thousand is rich at this ratio.
The one with 20 poor.
In the vision of society, poor people pay fair taxes, and the rich enjoy the benefits of the social state in which they do not share.
A rich one is simply needed to help them not to deal with needy poverty.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisitions, and Babiš can hold hands.
The rest of us, thanks to our grandfather, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
Then there is a question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are members and members of their parties or citizens of the state do not have their employees and countries for their property.
And eventually, those who want to live well in a rich land for all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex must have dropped by 234 million.
Selling real estate sometimes isn't easy.
And it will often not help him with 11 bedrooms, a wonderful view of the sea, or the fact that the real estate is sold by President Donald Trump.
When selling the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down on the incredible 8 million pounds.
The web was informed by Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like any other.
But neither did the real estate company with the U.S. President open an extreme price list.
Donald Trump had to reduce the price of his Caribbean headquarters on the incredible 8 million pounds.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price fell to £13 million.
Even after the sale, the villa complex stands about 76 average flats in the centre of Prague.
And there's nothing to blame.
The charming 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
There is a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Tens of smokes are planted on the property.
From the terrace is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the fact that the connection to the president was insufficient to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought real estate in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about £15 million.
The property was to buy for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on St. Martin Island.
But with a new price, it goes to second place.
The property in the neighborhood was awarded £13.5 million.
The NCAA decided to end up with two trainings a day.
The 11th morning and players of UCLA US Football are coming up to the sideline of a new school course.
Some of them take off their dressings and reveal sweaty backs, the unwitting sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most of the members of the team these few minutes nothing takes a lunch break.
Players registered in the summer semester will leave for rooms after three hours of training to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting held next morning at 6:30.
“For these guys, the next three days will be a real pop,” said Coach Bruins Jim Mora a moment before he went overboard on Tuesday.
By removing two trainings on one day, the NCAA wants to lighten off the players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday when the final exam ends.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 19:15 - to lock themselves in to so-shined diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons, which Mora spent as a coach in Westwood, starts training camp Bruins a week earlier than last year and training is limited for the summer semester. He also has a decision to limit the number of trainings from two to one per day.
A total of eighteen trainings are scheduled until August 20, starting formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
The sea has been heard to support the decisions of the NCAA, although it added another item to the already charged player’s already.
“Thir or four days are the players under great stress and it is very exhausting for them," Mora said.
“But nobody gave up, everyone's trying, they're great.
I think Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy to look at the clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center, which was occupied by the players after harvesting the protective net behind the brand bar.
The Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are empty during the season, the problem might arise.
"The ground will watch security service," Mora added.
“ Security is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
It's a good deal with that material.
Fortunately, the hotel will be watching security as well as parking lot 8.
We use our means.
I believe everything will be fine.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans to control facts more thoroughly to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to control third parties and show the findings under original contributions in an attempt to combat the so-called "fake news", said the largest social network on Thursday.
The company, in its declaration on its website, writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible Hoaxes that will be sent to third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the survey under the original contributions.
Facebook was named one of the main sources of false messages, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced the election of the President of the United States last year.
The French voters are flooded with false reports about the May presidential elections and Germany is planning ahead of the bright choices to put fine on the social media network if it does not rapidly remove angry contributions.
Facebook on Thursday, in his next statement published in Germany, stated that he was going to launch testing the new control function of fake messages in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In order to display reports certified by third parties, people demand more content so that they are better informed and they can make the right choice about what they can share," said Sara Su, the Facebook product manager.
She added that Facebook continued testing the functions of "consolidating articles" and was also working on other changes in order to reduce the number of false messages.
Create graphic novels: story about A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotland Castle recently played a major role in the Squeeze music video and its refuge in it was also Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
Scottey, however, was a witness from his cozy place near the Bewl River in British Kent for 700 years to a stormy story that inspired the winged Jamie Rhodes of York County, known for its envy in historical documents - to create graphic novels.
“Look at the Scriptures of a man who is 300 years after death,” says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic amendment A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived in the Scotland Castle from the Middle Ages to the Eduardian period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes book inspired by archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stores (2014), a collection of inspired documents from the British Library - a project that was very emotional to him.
"I was taken by a fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for Jacobi," he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to read a candle.
When I smell a letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone so fascinated by old papers, the support from the National Trust and Arts Council England is the opportunity to stay almost four months in the castle almost as a dream. (To be told, stay has been a little longer).)
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian “new” castle, going through archives and studying many treasures and curiosites, such as the head of hyena on the wall and bottles that have been fired for centuries in the ditch.
He walked through the property and examined the ruins of the old castle, talked to the evil gardeners and occasionally with the artists who worked in illustrations to his book.
At night, he "slept the whiskey and wrote."
Scotney's loyal history is relatively unfamiliar, as National Trust has gained access to documents only after the last heir died in 2006, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the place ten years later, the employees began to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described in words, as if “the aristocrats of many centuries were throwing their hands in the words: “Let it go into the attic.”
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps depicting property: “You may think the dispute of land is boring,” said Rhodes, “but I ran into one case where two families were pulling over the shore.
Stop it, people!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge and burrow deeper into the English history, including the story called The Labourer, which follows the man who leaves the newly built castle to join the England Uprising in 1381.
"I found a record of rebellion in the castle of 1380, which was called Knightly Familyes of Kent and Sussex," said Rhodes.
“ An English Uprising actually started in this area and I thought that rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe he's finally connected."
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - such as The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest, who had been hiding Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about a smuggler from the 18th century named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the stone coffin (which was found several years after the discovery of the coffin).
Rhodes’s favorite family is Darrell’s: “I was intrigued by male generations - these men were always in debt and spent money on things they could not afford.
The different generations of the Darrell family were dealing with it by taking rich or old ladies - I imagine it was the handsome gentlemen who, with a giant butterfly, were the heads of their grandfathers."
With the end of the stay at the Castle of Friday Rhodes after other adventures.
He recently returned from his two-week chat in the Finnish wilderness, where he inspired his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotland.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said to myself: 'Now I'm going back to my real life.'
Washington changes the conditions for a green card
The media published President Donald Trump's words on the US's new immigration plan, which will also change when awarding green cards.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50 000 this year as a result of stricter rules to grant temporary visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules propose Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars for taxpayers of taxation, and we have a change in the rules for spending green cards on residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
A new application process prior to the English speaking applicants who are passing through funding and proving the skills that will be for the benefit of our country," Trump said, quoted media.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be careful
Just when it seemed that 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, there's news on the Internet about the technological development of sex robots.
Yes.
The sexual robots are currently really popular.
Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to look seriously at the rise of sex robots.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the warts and the appearance of the nails robot.
“The people are pulling out of them, but sales are growing and we must be prepared to see them more and more frequently," Sharkey said on the occasion of the publication of the report.
Modern sex aids change from inflatables to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm on the touch - of course an artificial intelligence that imitates human behavior.
The user can modify the robot to his - from the color of the eye and shape of the nipples to the look and color of the nails.
But the very disturbing fact is that many robots have their own "personality" to shame Stepford's panic.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved in a robotic woman with a silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his replacement wife various character traits, between them and their shyness.
And then there's a sexual robot woman named Roxxxy Gold from True Companion, who is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including "friendly Farrah", who is characterised by the shy nature and "divocal Wendy" with the "good" nature.
“Roxxxy Gold is set to suit your personality to the maximum possible extent," writes True Companion.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
It's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, chatty, or “in the mood”.
The rise of sex robots is alarming for a few reasons - among which there is no confusion for real interhuman relations. The disturbing are rather inferior female traits and violent assaults - e.g. friligal (the reads of resistive) Farrah.
The company True Companion likes Roxxxy to a men vibrator on its website.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why couldn’t a Roxxxy man have?” writes on a page.
However, sexual robots are not just a fetish or sexual tool.
Their creation and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - remove from the ideal or sexual equality towards the desire for undermining sex with the choice of supplement.
Of course, most men do not buy a robot woman and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sexual robots remain at the edge of the general interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set by modern times.
And most people aren't strange or violent until they're left behind with a free market.
It is no accident that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world enjoy their rights, and in the White House, the President, who often speaks very shamefully to the woman's address.
The most horrific aspect of the series The story of the maid is not what we see - the sown bodies and the eyes, as rather the reality of these visions.
The book value of the Service Story represents a step in the right direction, but now it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots have as much as possible to look like genuine women (including the peace of pornes).
Their creators construct them so that they are pleasant to touch and work at first sight as a real woman.
However, when it comes to their “personality, ” the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job or history, nothing that stimulates their independence or violates their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they're nice slaves.
It speaks of the 21st century: maids.
The NBA star on the green armpit.
Curry's fighting for cut in California.
St. Stephen Curry's star basketball player, despite the waste first launch between professional golfers, did not lose.
Double holder of the award for the most useful NBA player played at the Ellie Mae Classic tournament lower Web.com Tour in Hayward's California first round at 74 hours and will fight for cut.
The Golden State player, who won the second title with the team Warriors in NBA this season, started a lot nervously and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he was not as precise as under the basketball basket, yet he left ten professionals with a balance of four wounds over a few.
"It wasn't the perfect way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first launch," Curry said.
It was very nervous, to launch the first shot at the tournament, but it was all that I hoped for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 on the first round," he said.
If Curryma manages to break through the cut that will probably set two hits under pairs, he will become the first representative of another sport that can do it on Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of the beams, perhaps it will go," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has already played the celebrity and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
He's starting a tournament in Hayward for the first time, falling under PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic received a sponsor’s exception and preserved amateur status.
The Web.com Tour is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
That's why Mitt Romney is the embodiment of sanity.
The unmistakable mark of Trump's era is becoming political splits that divide American voters, and in a micro-scale, they also break down entire families.
In the period of Christmas and Thanksgiving, the U.S. newspaper moved with advice on how to consult with relatives who chose Trump.
We're probably just waiting for him to give us the nerve.
However, less attention is given to Trump’s ability to embellish the family.
I'm talking about it because I was visited in New York this week by my cousin, a poet and a fan of the left, who lives in Chicago, who paid me for a long time in our family for a Republican hulupa.
She reminded me that softness in the face of a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, the whole family is suddenly - including all the Republican siblings with whom she has been extinguishing about politics for many years - on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing; but I find it a significant risk in the wider context.
Trump strengthens the left but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we're talking about normalization and Trump, we're referring to the scary possibility that his sarcomas might lose one day on attractiveness.
However, there is an even more horrendous long-term scenario in which Trump “normalises” the right-wing Republicans, who, by resisting its standards, will suddenly be an incarnation of what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgics in the heart, I remember Mitta Romney and his version of the crazy act - dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (but we were aware of his tax confession) - both of which look like a very mild influence compared to Trump.
Once Trumpa is gone, it will be sufficient for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be a tremendous improvement.
We used my cousin's visits and we took the kids to Central Park on the largest biker that runs New York Park Department - for your three dollars you won't find better use, unless you need caffeine.
Horses are huge, the middle cylinder is covered by glass - clowns and animals are filming and looking at their own shoulders - a completely clouded view and tinky music reminds public transport.
Many clichés soon freeze: looking from high-rise buildings, panorama looks, instead of breathing at you with an atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your imagination.
Twenty years later, I still haven't moved over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't actually Swiss cheese - you don't read the theme pub Ye Old Swiss Cottage - but the London subway station.
However, the colossal in Central Park has a remarkable magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-old children are enjoying it, as well as two mature women.
If I could evaluate the heater, it would deserve maximum points, but no one's asking, luckily.
This week, I had a similar experience at the store when I was asked to evaluate my "interest" on a scale from one to five.
The coffee shop on the corner of my street is the same, with the difference that I can throw 15% of the tip for something I buy at my counter.
Not only does it slow down otherwise fast selling, but the waitress is thus forced to stick in favor of shopping if it is not necessary.
A woman in the store apologized to me with a smile when I was eager to evaluate my credit card transfer by five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from the prison to the hospital for chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius had to be transported to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cut wounds on his wrist, which, according to the prison, caused himself to fall in a cell after falling.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appealing against the original death sentence.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in early hours on Valentine's Day 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the doors of the toilet closet in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he mistook her with a thief.
The applicants announced their intention to reinstate, this time against the six-year sentence of the Pistorius, which, according to their word, is too mild.
The National Prosecuring Authority stated that it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and that the trial would take place this year.
In case of success, Pistorius is threatened to extend the sentence to 15 years.
In South Africa, the death penalty does not apply.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young man in the captivity of a reared panda, who shattered in the wilderness.
It's a huge success for the Panda rescue program.
The Centre is trying to expand the pedd genophonds kept in captivity.
The worker of the Čang Č-čung centre has told the agency New China that panda breeding is at great risk from related cross-bordering.
In captivity, there were only 471 pandas at the end of last year.
There are only 2,000 thousands of them living in the outdoors.
The attempt to let the Pandas captured with the wild are so the first step toward panda farming is to help protect this species.
The 15-year-old Cchao-cchao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda's mating period on 11 March.
With the surveillance device on her neck, scientists could observe every step of her life.
She met her chosen woman Cchao-cchao 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the panda male lasted a minute and a half and occurred successfully.
Even this can be considered a little miracle, because the lords of males are not considered to be the most successful lover of animal empires.
The males generally misjudge the time when the female is ready, plus they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The youth was born healthy and, even though Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, it weighed after birth 216 grams.
The mean weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulhars, was arrested on August 1st in the early hours of the Sithonian police.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continued.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said for bTV that Bulgarian tourists were released later.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules for free camping and impose strict fines on anyone who is caught at the place where the campsite is not allowed.
Checks will take place throughout the season.
The Ministry stated that the court may impose fines.
The ball is the first round of British Open in the 50th place.
Golfer Klára Pilková stands after the first round of Major British Open at the 50th place.
In Scotland's Kingsbarns, the race was hit by one blow under steam when it played three yards and twice the bogey.
The twenty-year-old Czech player thus has the hope that the famous major will first go through the cut.
Entry into the competition with a donation of $3.25 million came out best for the American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the field record of 64 wounds, i.e. eight under pairs.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands withdraw millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed 180 poultry for the incident.
According to Reuters, the Dutch Food Safety Authority announced that it was investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry, which meant that 80 percent of the eggs on the market were not valid.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of egg types identified according to specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substances in eggs is small, and for adults it is not a danger, but a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesperson Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where authorities joined the closing of breeding, have not been imported to the Czech Republic recently.
However, vets will collect sample samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on which the markets of insecticides appeared.
Belgium's eggs were last in April and the eggs from the Netherlands last in May, according to the veterinary administration on the Czech market.
Chicken meat from Belgium was last discovered in June in the Czech Republic.
However, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of medicines against fleas, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organization considers it slightly toxic.
Its high doses lead to nausea and dizziness.
Riga's beautiful, I'm gonna miss her, she says Gogman Sedloček, and she's looking for an engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
"I'll go back there one day," smiled with 27-year-old Sedloček, who could start the season in a zlínské dress.
It depends on whether he gets involved in the launch of a new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I were to evaluate it as a school, in three.
I didn't catch much for the first year, I had an experienced goalie in front of me.
I've learned my lesson.
I got caught in the next year.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought a new goalmate with whom I was dealing again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch all the time.
But during the initial ten games, we only got five points, so the trainers started to spin.
In the end, my colleague was getting more caught.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it next season.
How was life in Riza?
Beautiful.
It's small Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend in there.
We're together for the third year, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How difficult is the KHL for goalkeepers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are men like us or Slovan, who must change their game style against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, more fighting.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the field.
The difference is the Russians want to play empty.
The coin shoots, and even though they have half-empty goal, they prefer to record.
In the Czech Republic only shoots more.
Didn't you have a problem traveling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
She can sleep in peace.
The program is mostly done by playing like four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Lotys even see their club in KHL?
As a national team.
The whole Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball is a national sport.
It's all great.
Even though it didn't work, there were a lot of people.
Did Dinam’s activities in KHL help to say that Latvia has almost gone to the quarterfinals this year’s world championship?
KHL has been playing since 2008, and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since the same time, their results began at the world championship to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi fell in the quarterfinal with Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading for the Czech extraligion.
Roberts Bukarts settled in Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs before signing the contract.
What makes you think so many come here?
They're not bet players, they're really good.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Lotyš among them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still out of your league?
In early February, I knew I wouldn't go on to Riza.
In the fall, we began to look for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie budget, we didn't talk.
Then it was classic.
We had fun with different teams, which decided in the finals for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and waiting for something to appear.
Aren't you nervous about it?
I was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was gonna happen.
The current situation isn't the best, on the other hand, I'm home after some time.
I caught something in KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The only question is when and where I sign.
How real is the variant that you're going to start your new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
Let's see what's next month's worth.
Now I can just wait for the agent to set up.
Do you prefer a contest?
The last season wasn't so much for me to choose.
So I'm waiting on the phone.
The government flight at Let continues.
In January this year, I wrote about the camp in Lety u Orlík in an article with a proper householder?
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I would like to remind myself of the difficult passages of the article.
There have been talk about camp in Lety for many years.
For readers who do not exactly know what is going on, it will probably be best to look at e.g. the official cultural sites of the Pieční place Leta.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, they will learn that the camp stood two kilometres east of Leta, that from 8.8. 1940 served as a labor camp, from 1. 1942 he was a collection camp and from 2.8. 1942 he became a gypsy camp.
The further text describes the course of life in the camp, including the non-human conditions, until March 1943, when the first summer prisoners were included in Auschwitz transport.
On 4. 5. 1943, 370 people were transported by the largest transport to the extermination camp.
There were 420 of them.
A very sad story of the immense hardships of human beings that have caused them human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no dispute that these events need to be remembered constantly.
Nor is it disputed that this reminder should take place in the memorial in the place of experienceable suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During socialism, it was somewhat forgotten at the camp, and in the 1970s it was near and built on a part of the former camp.
History of the camp randomly discovered in 1992 the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 he was exposed to the memorial in Lety.
In the mid - 1990 ’ s, the government promised to buy back and destroy the country, but so far it has not happened.
In 1998, the memorial was declared cultural monument and since 2009 its administration under Lidice Memorial has fallen.
In July 2013, he invited the UN Human Rights Committee of the Czech Republic to close the case.
So much brief facts about the postwar fate of the camp.
Until last autumn, the government approved the ransom directly and decided to draw up an expert assessment to determine the price.
Then, according to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will buy it out.
According to Minister of Culture Herman, "some numbers exist, but I would probably dream of seeing them in the public."
Let's see what the expert report will bring.
According to some unofficial estimates, hundreds of millions may go, according to others, the price can reach a billion.
Either way, it won't be cheap.
And yet only a few hundred metres from the former camp is a monument to which the state was able to invest almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction were to be financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which seems to be in no danger, I think it would be the same to throw money away.
Which doesn't have a different priority for the government?
The memorial, a dignified place, stands practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy and whoever wants it, can commemorate the sufferers and the murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the fifth place with maximum care.
The property entrusted, i.e. the taxpayers' money, should be the responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, to treat the care of a proper householder.
At least with one like your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister are not the whole government.
But I still see from the perspective of the above-mentioned facts the password of the leader of the movement ANO only as an empty pre-selection clearance.
This May I went straight to the scene.
Very decent arrival road, arranged parking lot, replicas of wooden camp barracks.
In one exposure, in another integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and overlooking its own Piet site, which is made of stones located in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place as they look and belong.
Archaeological research is currently under way at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would be possible, for example, to preserve part of the discovered bases and to make at least visually accessible.
That way, the Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could put on his efforts.
In the event that he manages to redeem himself in favor of state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic action as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolates can relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare for your digestive system.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: diet rich in animal proteins and dairy products could help to relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease affecting up to 1.3 million U.S. population and 300 000 patients in the UK causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded of not using meat and dairy products to mitigate symptoms. However, researchers of Washington University have discovered that the essential amino acids of triptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that promote bowel resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells protect the intestines and ensure that harmful microbes are removed from the food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
As soon as the bowls of the scale lean on the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
In research scientists found the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerance in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the formation of cells the presence of triptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a connection between one kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - a common part of the intestinal microbioma and the development of cells that support body tolerance.
The more triptophans had mice in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
At the same time, he suggested that if the same applies to humans, then the combination of L. reuteri bacteria and diets rich in triptophan helped to develop a more tolerated and less inflammatory bowel environment.
Postgraduate researchers Dr. Luis Cervantes-Barraganwas, in the course of studying a kind of immune cell supporting body tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells while the second group of same mice kept separate cells missing.
It was due to the fact that one group of mice had different intestinal microbiom — a community of bacteria, viruses and molds, which commonly reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The core of the mouse was tested by means of a method of decomposition of DNA and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells missing from the second group of mice.
The mice that were kept in a sterile environment and lacked gut microbiom - so they did not develop this kind of immune cell - were given the L. reuteri bacteria - and they created immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers developed L. reuters in fluid and then carried small amounts of fluid - without bacteria - undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immunity cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the fluid, it turned out that this was a by-product of triptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. After multiple triptophan doses also decreased by half the number of cells.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us keep the bacteria L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether end products of the L. reuteri triptophane cause the development of cells in humans in the same way as mice, but defects in triptophan-related genes have been detected in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Every one of us should probably strive for the development of these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high levels of triptophane in the presence of L. reuteri bacteria may increase cell population."
José Mourinho considers the signing of the treaty with Nemanj Matić and its transition to Manchester United to be “genic”
Manchester United gained a genius to his team in the form of Nemanja Matiće - at least that's what José Mourin's thought after he debuted in the Middle War against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed the contract for £40 million, said in the first match of the prize 2:1 in Dublin - the last pre-sponsor against the UEFA Super Cup where the United will meet on Tuesday with Real Madrid - and he was involved in his role as a backupr alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not take part in the team’s previous Asian tour, Matić had no form and only played 45 minutes, in which, according to Mourinha, another Premier League season needs to be worked before the start.
"He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent and has brilliant thinking - he thinks football," Mourin said.
"We'll help him to get to his condition as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku have also played the first game at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho begins to form its eleventh for the next season.
The independent source announced this week that Mourin still wanted to sign a contract with three other players, but insisted that the club had done a “fantastic job” and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank you for helping me get three of the four players," he added.
"Four of four would please me more, but I acknowledge that they've done my best."
Life challenge of the king of chicken skins Ládi Hruška.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This promising picture began to rumble with a new show on TV Prima Zdenkov's Academy.
The puzzle immediately blew up the chance.
"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to join your Academy of Cooking, because I think I can learn a lot from you," he called him in the video on the social network.
And since the two of them have been peaking for a couple of years, she hasn't forgotten to double-cross him this time.
"In return, I can teach you Znojem from diet chicken meat, American cucumbers or invite you to water and show you why it's favorite fried cheese," Hruška was rapping.
He really means his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss said," he said.
But he did not express himself because he was filming new works of his next show Yes, Chief!
Only Prima responded to taking the whole matter as his personal activity outside of the TV to play with Huška in the culinary Academy.
In December 2004, Hruška Pohlreich founded his first cook.
Over 300,000 pieces have been sold to her in a few days!
The new show, which introduced Prima yesterday at the press conference on the autumn transmission schedule, is an unpatriated cooking school.
In the twelfth of his disciples he chooses from among the viewers, and in twelve works he is acquainted with the twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show now the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk on the back of his trick had his toenailed pear pane.
If he had my face there, I'd laugh a lot.
"With the pear I'm just squeezing - the pear is healthy fruit and has plenty of vitamins," Láďa responded.
He thinks about Boat's culinary art.
"I don't care about being home because I don't let my Gastropunk go home," my boss says.
I really appreciate that Zdenka Pohlreich, I even think I'm making chicken for honey.
On my show, his recipes will definitely not appear," Hráška did not forgive.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook for me. He's a TV clown.
"Gastronomy illiterate or idiot," said Pohlreich about Hrušek on one lecture.
"I'm not 20 years old to be able to wave hands over them, but I don't care about them anymore," Hrušek said.
British inventor uses microchip in his hand to wash the car and house by wave
The British inventor became the first person in the country with microchip inserted into the body. A simple wave of hand can unlock the door from the house and offices and even start the car.
Three-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip implanted between finger and index finger and currently offers the same service through its BioTeq company and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist of Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, over the procedure of implantation and compliance with medical procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted by dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
The Northam company also offers the exchange of door and car locks, compatible with the microchip. The price of one lock is £300.
The married father of one child had the technology integrate into his home and his BMW Z4 car brand that would start with a simple wave of hand.
The revision of the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
The White House's decision to fly with the Navy helicopter to South Lawn on the occasion of the celebrations of the US manufacturing industry that took place last month came according to the Navy records issued by the TIME weekly to $24,000.
Green White helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the culmination of the programme of 17 July in the White House, which was a tour of American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several high White House officials were watching a parade of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut Helicopter was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
Military Officer White House issued a fragmented order or FRAGO and applied for the presence of helicopters not less than 36 hours before the landing of helicopters on South Lawn in the context of the “mivorous” event, reported the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for the management of helicopters.
"I wanted to make sure that you had the awareness of such significant events," wrote HMX-1 in an e-mail to his superior, representatives of the Navy commander the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on 17 July at around 7:00 a.m. on the occasion of the show, the beginning of which was scheduled for 15:00 and remain in place until a complete clearance of the whole place, which was planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
The e-mail also stated that if there was a delay in leaving the White House, a replacement return flight crew will be sent due to the working time regulation.
The original crew remained on site that night together with the helicopter and the unit of security personnel together with them.
It wasn't visible whether the second crew was finally sent out.
Hatch Act prevents state officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible infringements of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured everything was all right," the commander wrote.
"It sounds as if you were blocked," said the deputy commander.
This “Made in America” show was marked by the White House as an official event, and Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the President promoted the health reform that was going through the Senate and talked about the attempt to keep the government's regulation at the time.
The use of air transport means such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when travelling.
However, their presence solely because of presentation is unusual.
Trump ordered control in February after the President's aircraft was driven in the background at his first meeting in the framework of the Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is covered by complaints about the use of the president's aircraft by his predecessors.
“The White House is pleased with the show “Made in America” which introduced products from all 50 states that make Americans from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, deputy press secretary.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in Washington and South Lawn, and train possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump participated in the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, the HMX-1 held 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the show Made in America was part of the current training of the crew, said the state officials.
The helicopter unit flew on the same day within the framework of the “non-president support missions” for another 11 hours.
The White House stated that no further prophesy was covered by taxpayers' money.
Sikorksky spokesperson stated that the company was not interested in any way in the negotiations to put helicopters on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for the presidential years and the exact costs in relation to the show is difficult to determine by sea.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017 is the refund of the DoD expenditure for VH-3D 24 380 $ per flight hour.
Unit records are 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are significantly below the said amount.
"The cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenditure is very misleading," Walters said.
‘These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs, which are included in annual costs.’
According to the 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement of the expenditure of the DoD does not include staff costs, but includes the cost of fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
The then press secretary of the White House Sean Spicer defended the use of helicopters for the purpose of the show.
“The idea of a show that takes place this week is to introduce products produced in the USA”, said Spicer.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to the defence of our state, and that they provide work to hundreds, if not to thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we're proud of helicopters and other military facilities whose production involves countless American citizens.
This fact is important to remember."
It's not clear if Trump was also on a helicopter when he was at South Lawn's place. With certainty, only that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House Trump addressed Sikorsky's representative and joked the media about his own fleet of products.
"Sikorsky I know very well," said the President, "I own myself now three."
A young woman was stuck in a swamp near Mácha's lake, and the police were squandering to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday about two o'clock in the morning.
But instead of bathing, she remained trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask her cell phone to help a cop, she had the last 12 percent of her batteries.
"That's why the police soon lost contact with her," said the police spokesperson Ivan Baláková.
A few police patrols went to a place that was about to be described, but finding a young woman wasn't easy at all.
"Some police officers had to beard with seaweeds hundreds of meters before they could feel the land under their feet," Baláková approached.
And she was also missing.
The police were focused on the way her call for help came from.
"To not at least lose this connection, they talked to her about counting out loudly," the speaker said.
Police women found five in the swamps in Bornna.
She was on the verge of physical and psychological forces, and there was signs of cooling.
That's why an ambulance sent her to the Cheskolip Hospital.
Grandpa's connection to STAN?
There's a sales girl coming out of a desired bride.
That's a little ironic.
His web project searchameslusny.cz as if a billionaire voter basically said that STAN suffers from the deficit of decent people.
And he also argued that the politically unpopular party of less known mayors and independents had no national programme for the House's elections.
Her election candidate simply becomes a decent person after an interview with her grandfather, no matter what political opinion.
It used to be the beginning of Vít Bárt, and it didn't work out very well.
In addition to his rush to decent people and personalities, which will replace some mayors or candidates, which will also allow Gazdík, the popular argument of boss STAN also disturbs that the greatest value of movement is just politically verified and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians as well as surveyed.
You're free to wipe out the rapidly collected unknown personalities.
The total dissolution with the human beings, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík explained even by the fact that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the people's candidates.
But if STAN suspected a few more things from his identity then, after Grandpa's arrival, there's a mere game of identity ending.
Not only Gazdík has long defined himself against ANO Andrei Babiš, but the grandfather who publicly praised Babis said: "My goal is to make the movement ANO, that is, the Starost movement has gained 20 percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope you're not wrong about the move.
Grandpa is a successful businessman, and the billionaire is certainly not an accident.
He often speaks about politics like Babish, but he does not have his own political brand.
STAN has been resembling reality show for some time rather than a real political side, and Grandpa's hand is as if she's even more of a selling girl from the desired bride.
STAN went with TOP 09 for a while, then with the people, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone hears.
Police dogs practiced helicopters in Bridge
Dogs specialized in search of explosives and search dogs were trained at Lake Most by helicopter flyers today.
The police dog must not be afraid and be afraid of flying, said the leading police cynologists of the Ústecky Region, Petr Tomášek.
It takes about two years to train a cop's dog.
At Mosttu, they practiced both adult-training dogs and those who were still going through training.
In addition to standard training, in which they were to reveal sharp specimens of explosives in the lake and seek the lost manikant, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in a helicopter.
So as soon as the helicopter gets here, the dog can go to work so that he doesn't have a problem with the path of the helicopter.
"The helicopter, the dog goes and searches immediately," said Tomášek.
A dog who is restless or is unable to start working immediately is eliminated from training.
"They keep them all, for example, in the garden," said Tomášek.
The police have 76 dogs in the U.S. region with various specialties.
The German Shepherds are overrun, but there are also Belgian Shepherds.
He's been cared for by the monster since the puppy.
"He raises him himself, prepares him for his service, which the dog will do for us," said Tomášek.
Animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations that may reveal possible health hendikes.
If the dog is healthy and unfavorable, it shall consist of the first test in 20 months.
"The sharp intervention reaches about two and a half to three years," said Tomášek.
The length of the police service depends on the health condition of the dog.
It usually serves up to eight to ten years.
They usually live in their flocks.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
The elections may only be credible if all the members of the company, including women, participate in the UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of UN Assistance Mission, said that the election to local representatives is taking part in hundreds of women, three women are seeking post-presidentship, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he stated in his mid-term statement.
The elections may be fully representative and credible only if they are involved by women as well as all related processes that relate to the choices.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan take place on April 5th.
The Taliban has published several threats to the electoral process that shifts international fighting activity to the other.
In this election, for the first time, one democratically elected government is bringing its power peacefully to the following government.
Haysom said that women's strong role will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
Afghani’s independent electoral committee stated that over the total 3.6 million registered voters represented 1.2 million women.
The unique brewer cooks beer again.
For a good beer in a resurrected brew.
The delivery and honesty of the new owners returned to the life of the brewery in Lobč near Mšen a few years ago.
The beer was first renaissance core already in 1586, and was converted into parostroial operation in the 19th century.
It followed years of bloom, when the brewer was famous mainly for dark beer.
Unfortunately, during World War II production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, buildings have served to the state of the ship.
The destruction was done by the owners of the Brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devasted and disassembled to building materials.
In 2007, however, a new hope of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzov.
They began to repair buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of the construction and every detail.
They carefully focused on studying archive materials, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
The beer has the same shape as in the 19th century when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded a declaration of the Brewery for the cultural memory of the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European industrial heritage trails.
In 2015, the traditions of brewing beer were newly restored.
To taste the great locustic beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínska, visit the meeting area of the Brewery.
When making beer here, Kokořínský water springs in a protected landscape area, salt of locust fields and Žatecký hops.
In the bar you will taste the traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specialties.
And don't miss a tour of the brewery, it's held Saturday and Sunday at noon and half two.
The biggest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the greatest strengths of his type on a worldwide scale?
This unique building was supposed to be the Fortress Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacler, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Baba.
Originally, it was supposed to be made up of up to twelve bunkers connected with large underground.
Here was supposed to be headquarters, barracks, ammo warehouses, materials, power plant, machinery and hospital.
But the construction ended the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, he was able to build a single powerful reinforced concrete bunker and underground spaces were broken out.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from Spółku Stachelberg, who began to build a unique construction in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
It's now 75 percent made available underground!
Part of the complex is, in addition to the foot screw T-S 73 with exposure and underground and armed object of light fastening, two built-in foot screws, stungs and a learning trail of built Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, cozy altánek and stunning views to the landscape guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has come to the list next to such monuments as the Great Chinese Wall, the Traian Port at Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineve and Nimrud.
Klášter Chotěšov originally from the beginning of the 13th century, which today consists primarily of a huge four-king building of the convention over the beautiful garden.
The list he reached, but unfortunately, belongs to the unique buildings that are threatened by the disappearance.
The Nazis, however, do not want to give up and have many events in support of the monastery.
One of them is another year evening for the Chotěšov monastery on this Saturday, where mj. Vladimir Míšík, Ivan Hlas, you will see the Šermír performances and you will look at the beautiful vast buildings, which are usually unavailable.
But you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

You will find out how the Neanderthals have been able to cope perfectly with the various extreme climate conditions, especially with the changing of ice and intermediate days.
Despite their simple material culture, they were extremely successful predators of their time.
You will also learn what their anatomia, technological skills and hunting agreements looked like, but also their aesthetic feelings.
That you wouldn't say that to the Neanderthals?
Let yourself be convinced in Brno.
The 14th KELT & WORLD MUSIC festival is held on Saturday on the fifth in Veverá Castle.

The chef Miroslav Kalina will cook, taste culinary specialities and regional food, enjoy musical and dance performances, a rich program for children such as creative workshops, theatres, jumping castle, Šmoulího competitionist and, of course, a number of competitions.
Know the plant with one click.
Students with herbarians and ordinary plant lovers will help the new free application of Pl@ntNet.
If they are interested in what plant they have just encountered on walking, these applications will advise them.
All they have to do is photograph the plant, and the application itself will know what kind it is.
The new application, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of CEEV Centre of Ethics and Environmental Education in Bratislava’s Horský park as part of the City’s Secret Life Project.
The project also involved students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools who took photographs of the application database and added plants from their surroundings.
The newly created French app is free to download on the city's Secret Life website.
The main goal of the French programmers was to contribute as many people as possible to the application with their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognise.
"The children who will keep the tablet or mobile in their hands can go out into the forest," said Ivana Poláčková, coordinator of this project.
Based on a high quality photo of the flower, leaves or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize in a few seconds its name, which will then be assigned under the photograph in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and English.
It is therefore welcome that users, after creating an account, contribute to the application by means of a plant image that is not yet found in the database.
"Francoouzi will assess if it is beneficial, and then add it to the database," Poláčková informed.
Fears of GMB for investing in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
Departments require assurance from managers of McVitie's cookie manufacturer about the long-term production commitment in the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish Trade Union of GMB stated that the company has been silent for the time being about any investments in the Tollcross factory.
There are more than 500 employees in the factory who produce Hobnob and Rich Tea, other than products and biscuits.
McVitie's owner, Pladis, stated that over 5 million pounds had invested in the whole area over the past few years.
She added that the employees and representatives of the trade unions would be "the first informed ones" in the case of changes in the operation of the factory.
The Scottish GMB Departments expressed their concerns in the letter of the construction company’s letter that McVitie’s “will not be able to make financing and modernization of production lines.”
The main organizer of GMB Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the contractor about the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
Many families and employees worked here mostly from the local community and the Glasgow region, where work in this factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the field of high unemployment and social separation.
From the point of view of work, wages and benefits - and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and decreasing slow production - needs the eastern part of Glasgow desperately prosperous producer like McVitie's."
The spokesperson of Pladis said: “The Governors of Tollcross received a letter from the GMB only yesterday, and the company will declare as soon as possible because we value the continuing commitment to the employees and representatives of the trade unions.
A regular meeting with the staff and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago, and many problems were opened at this meeting.
We spoke with employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “We have invested 5 million pounds in the Tollcross area in recent years, especially in production lines and traffic efficiency.
We value Tollcross's heritage and localities very much, and in the event of any change in the operation of the factory, employees and representatives of the trade unions will be immediately informed."
She warned the PSG of Barcelona about Neymar moving three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymara to win her side after she completed £189 million, i.e. the amount needed to buy Neymara out of the contract, but warned this French team of Barcelona about its record raid three years ago?
The Ligue 1 Club is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, who paid £89 million for it last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and also the best paid professional athletes in the world - after tax, it will collect over £500 000 per week from PSG team.
Barcelona is bitter in the way that Neymar has engaged in his contract, despite the fact that a confidential source has confirmed that the club has always tried to satisfy Neymar in all things since his coming from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted to this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs who would be interested in preventing one of the best PSG players.
“I don’t have fear, because as soon as anyone tries to get one of our players, we will certainly address one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed an intentional line when she expressed interest in PSG Marca Verratti's backup in summer.
PSG has made it clear in the sense that under no circumstances will the Italian representative allow Italy to leave, so it is possible that Barcelona now swallows the bitter pill for its bold conduct with Neymara's departure.
Who's gonna explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broad understanding rules?
Donald Trump was pushing counter-corruption sanctions.
The day before that, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura.
And the day before Trump wrote that China did nothing about North Korean threat and that it would not go on like this.
Even that makes it easier to think of sanctions as a shoe break.
You can't throw those things in one bag.
Madur's Venezuela really went on her way to the dictatorship, or totality.
China doesn't just act the way the US president would like.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if anyone wanted to sum it up so that even a common electorate, an American, a European or otherwise, they could understand what the rule system is and what a policy of sanctions is based on, it would be almost impossible to do.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump was merely drawing attention to what President Obama had already prepared, he just gave it an implementing stamp.
Then why such a start?
Last year Europe was terrified that if the US elections win Trump, let's hug Putin and withdraw the sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
In practice, it's the other way around.
The sanctions aren't released with Trump, but they're tightening up.
But Europe is scaring even more.
German Secretary Zypries says that Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Like a kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then they are not kosher or anti-EU sanctions.
The Head of European Commission Juncker complains again that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
Is it like they're supposed to use sanctions just as weak as to not threaten anyone?
A normal voter gropes.
Three years have he heard that the fate of anti-Roman sanctions depends solely on the fulfilment of Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
It is now known to be the EU's energy security.
The voter gets bigger and bigger.
Russia's sanctions come in for being too attached to where it doesn't have anything.
China is being absorbed for not being mounted.
The Venezuelan President is punished for building a dictatorship at the borders of his country.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, rules or rules in it?
Andrej Babiš: I don't consider working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš is married, cruising the Republic with his visionary book and finalizing the election program.
In addition to the Pardubian region, all candidates have been finished.
According to his words, he did not significantly interfere with them.
He even agreed to lead the Moravian-Silesian Captain and shadow Minister of Education ANO Ivo Vondrák.
"But if it succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a Member or a captain," Babish confirmed his former opinion.
A lot of national politicians and representatives have pissed off your thoughts that directly elected mayors and Mayors should run municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a favourer of direct democracy, we vote directly by the President, and I am convinced that we should also vote for mayors and Mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about interference, they can be there.
The question is, how many are there.
When I present your book about what I dream about when I sleep, I heard on your own ears that you were talking about cancelling the representative.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct choice and reducing the number of representations.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 alternates.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the Mayor says that little people are building up and have not prepared big projects, but she has no authority to do so.
The same is true of the government that only two people, Klaus and Zeman, managed in our history.
Which means I'm not saying they did well.
But the present Prime Minister is not in charge of anything, he's just modernizing the debate.
That can't work.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to settle.
There's only one-wheel change in the program for the Senate.
We have also proposed the leniency mandate of ministers and the amendment to the Rules of Procedure of the House in order to prevent unnecessary exhibition of Members who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to be presented at the meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are worried about.
That as dictator you will run the government, control the House with 101 Members, cancel the country and the Senate and through the grateful mayors and mayors you will dominate the whole country.
I'm sure it isn't.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
The French President Macron reported a third reduction in the legislative congregation, but there are 57,000 French legislators on one piece, while it comes to 17 000 Czechs.
However, no one's accusing of threatening democracy.
Even if someone won the majority election in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms to prevent him from making dramatic changes.
The channels for having a parliamentary majority, however, are great, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There's no such thing in the case of the ANO movement.
We just need a team in the government to work for people, not for their gangs or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree to just raise the salary of teachers, employees in culture and social services.
Why did they vote me out and add 21 percent to the GIBS who are already receiving 60,000?
Would you come to that as Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister is supposed to intervene when ministers behave unattractively, confuse the government with travel agencies and pay the state money they would like to do like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers in government are not supposed to fight, politicians are supposed to talk out of her.
The cabinet has to go to the finished material, there's no room for coalition riots, force votes, and business, where it's supposed to be decided.
How would you like to have a cooperative team when the ministers are acting mainly sides-by-side?
There's a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said the coalition contract was not valid, and he went out of the government of Babish.
That can be done by every Prime Minister.
But if the personality and its ability are in control, similar to that of the board gesture does not need.
It measures everyone as well as everyone needs perfect performance.
Do you know who you would suggest to the Minister of Finance?
I'm not even thinking about it, but I don't think we're gonna be in this government, and nobody wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I've done so bad.
There's so much sceptic there.
The mayors have won entrepreneurs Grandpa, who would like to cooperate with you, perhaps the people will win the wing of the favored Jiří Čunka.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out coalition with the ANO, in the ODS may be planted by Václav Klaus ml.
I'd leave it on the constituency.
Vice Prime Minister and Vice President ANO Richard Brabec said you have many common points with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the economy.
So, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um,
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, running as a puppet of Vita Bárta for VV, then getting money from Dawn for his company, there was a pup.
Of course, he's an important personality.
A bit brown, of course.
If I take his program, there's a wide range of people involved in society management, direct democracy, that's acceptable.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I am interested in whether there is an acceptable person for you who has xenophobic opinions, speaking at protests with gallows and wants to step out of the EU?
We're not thinking about working with Mr. Okamura's party, I can't imagine.
Clearly, he went to politics to benefit from it.
What about the silent support of the Communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It's about negotiating the winner with the other in order, but God knows who the winner is and who's two.
Of course, it is important that they be able to reach out to the coalition government program.
Let's go back to your attempt to be a company.
But the government simply has to manage, Prime Minister Sobotka had everything thrown out, never decided.
Coalition issues like ČEB or EGAP didn't work.
But Saturday is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
As soon as he did, ČEZ ruled the Czech government.
After all, it is incredible that the Prime Minister has delivered a resolution written by ČEZ's management, which imposes on the Minister of Finance as he is to vote on the General Assembly of ČEZ.
If you become prime minister, will you change your staff ratios to the Supervisory Board and replace ČEZ's top management?
Jesus, if I'm the Prime Minister, we'll see each other.
I'm not him yet.
It is clear that ČEZ has already sent out signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with the ČSSD would like to exchange for even better with the ANO.
Maybe after the election, everything will go further.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have any lobbies of the humble or the Rose, I'm a separate unit, and I don't care about that at all.
So answer me directly.
If you are at the head of the government, will you strive to exchange the leadership of ČEZ, Czech Television or General Health Insurance, i.e. institutions that you criticize?
I'd like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
For years now, he's been doing what he wants, thanks to a commission for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is keep an eye on Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he has to stand in ČEZ Majority, he never drove it, he was only there in numbers, which is wrong.
It's a trivial thing for me.
ČEZ is supposed to take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them in a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supply contest or find a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state has to finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And the Czech Television?
Some of her shows are leading a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don't have and I don't have any authority to fire anyone.
But control is yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay for public service broadcasting and television charges about 7.2 billion a year, but they don't really know how they manage these institutions.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House endorses the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the position of Directors-General of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
Look how these reports are discussed, the super-powerful Saturday Kalousek pact that always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission to escape from the investigation files and to lex Babiš.
And Saturday was so stupid that he let Kalouska push me to get me out of the government, which contributed to the TOP 09 percentage, but the ČSSD took them.
They're afraid of breaking their corruption system, so they're talking about threatening democracy by Babish.
Nobody's immune.
What do you say to articles describing how the first Vice-President of ANO Jaroslav Faltýnek builds his power base by putting his son into the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and establishing a related lawyer to Květoslav Hlín contracts with city and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or the Czech Railways?
We've got a permanent beef with that.
I don't like it, and I've read it to him several times.
Faltýnek argues that the lawyer mentioned works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't act like that.
As finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, never had a corruption affair, no Pelta, Kratochvíl, March.
If there was any indication of clientelism, we immediately threw that person away.
In this respect, I am uncompromise.
If something like this happened, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
