ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort nor the confectionery
The new councillors of the ČSSD will seem to have to overcome a certain language barrier in the Prague Council and in the representation of their old colleagues from the ODS.
Journal News.cz members of the new ČSSD board "test" as they know the newly introduced slang, which has taken place at the city hall in the last years when Prague has ruled the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which was introduced by the Prague political party during the previous era by Mayor Paul Béma, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and coffees in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, the new councillors do not understand too much.
At least she says so.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am more new in Prague politics," responded to the tests of the "kmotrovské" dictionary of councillor for the culture of Lukáš Kauký.
And although it was a political vet, the councilman Karel Březina responded similarly.
Like a "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you're showing me, which I sometimes use."
"Jinak slang generally doesn't recognize."
From the dictionary whose expressions the daily News.cz published in June before the ODS election congress, she chose six examples, mostly those that are notally linked to Prague Magistrate.
Socialists were supposed to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the confectionery", "bean Shije", "fare of the capital" and "oplech".
Three of the councillors agreed with the speech, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, to be the head of Prague School for the future - first promised the interview, but no longer received the phone.
The fifth councilman Petr Dolínek refused the test.
"I don't deal with these things at all, and I'm not going to judge people's Democrats."
"I am now dealing with how we will understand in our programmes," he responded.
As has already been said, Councilman Lukáš Kauký would not, in the title, allegedly, know that there is talk of a powerful businessman and friend of exprimator Bémator Bém Romana Janoušek.
"Voldemort" doesn't tell Kaucky anything, and the only term he rightly estimated in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"That's the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucky, and now he adds, "But I know it from the paper."
"I'm gonna have to pay some language class," he's joking.
The golf hole as the tunnel Blanka deciphers not only the Matador Karel Březina, but also the councillor for the environment Lukáš Plahná.
The two social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáša Plachym is familiar with where to find this character - the ink of the term "go to the confectionary".
"I mean to go to some Prague business," Plachá near decoupling that it is the home of Janouškov's companies.
In accord with March, he points out that knowledge has drawn more from the newspapers than to use such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the ferventants of the test, no similar dictionary of slang expressions exists.
"I've been dealing with colleagues, but it seems we really don't have anything like that."
"We call more names, sometimes we use shortcuts and combination names," says the chairman of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulinský, who the parties relinquish Huld.
"At school they called me Břez, but I don't know if they call me colleagues," admits Karel Březin to his own nickname.
The daily Currently.cz name has tried and works.
Radní Weinert is for the Wednesday or less friendly grandfather, Deputy Minister Miroslav Poche, who alerted himself before the election of the party's sponsorship frauds, has a nickname "Igráček" for some colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only thing that social democrats allow in-trolateral expression.
Hulinský said he does not like Huld, but the daily of the present day.cz also noted another nickname of this Prague chairman.
"Doctor of shoes law" recalls that Petr Hulinský won his title as JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit torture, published a brochure
Women declared in Burkina Faso as witches have several common characters.
Rather, they belong to an older generation, they cannot engage in work, for example, for health reasons, are free and do not have children.
The one that becomes a witch is sent to isolation not to threaten the rest of the village.
"This fate can rarely happen."
"There are no young healthy women, because they help with work and birth children," describes the order nurse, who is more than one hundred women in Burkina Faso's home in the capital of Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to step up against an unusual "social measure".
She handed out an information brochure that should help chase the witches down.
But the thing is a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," pointed out Die Standard's disadvantage in writing.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana with Burkina Faso neighbor, last week, twenty-seven-year-old Amma Hemmaho died after she was tortured by three women and two men tortured by kerosene and burned.
The case was reported to the BBC server.
The perpetrators claim it was an unfortunate coincidence.
On a woman’s version, the oil was injected into the woman’s body, which is used for ritual rites.
He said that after the group wanted to "exploit evil spirit" out of women.
The isolation of 'arabites' supports people regardless of their level of education.
Der Standard's diary quoted a twenty-four-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "The human soul eaters have always been a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso is chasing witches, the government is trying to moderate him, the President himself attended him in Gambo this year.
"The Gembian President Jammí, after his aunt's death, made an extensive hunt for witches, who were supposed to participate in her death and try to kill the President himself."
"He invited shamans from nearby Guinea, who accompanied policemen, soldiers and personal security guards to violently take out selected men and women from the gambian village to the President's farm in Kanila," said Amnesty International in her report.
People at the farm had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused gut and kidney problems.
Two prisons didn't survive the farm.
After international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were released for freedom.
Bakal's tenant: Top in stone, higher rent signed
The older seconded man stepped out of the door of the client center of the company RPG Flats "hellobarona" Zdenek Bakaly, the largest private owner of rent apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arms he carried the file, and in it he took a new lease for three apartments: his daughter, his son, who is in the execution of the punishment.
All three of the deregulations just picked up the rent.
Instead of 3500 a month, the son from next year will pay for 2+1 second category 4100 crowns.
"And it's not hot water, and to drink it must be a petrame (the stone on solid fuel, the red.)," shows a man with a finger in his son's new covenant, where his signature has full power.
"But I signed it," explains half angry and half responsibly.
The Civil Association of BytyOKD.cz, which new lease terms have declared 'incorruptional and immoral', advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December when they publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man just has a wave of his hand.
"One says it, the other one," they blink.
Island becomes a large laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, a large majority of apartments have no market rent in the Czech Republic.
Currently.cz therefore decided to visit "laborator" personally.
The Havířov waiting room RPG is one of a total of four in Ostrava and on Tuesday at 9 am is already full.
Right next to the door, there's a security guard from the security agency, and she's got a starting device.
"Ukraine 2011", lights the special button on its touch screen.
One tap and one paper with a number comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your cifra is already beeping on a large screen under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're up in half a second.
After a while, the rent comes to ask an older couple, and there's no doubt about new rents in the waiting room.
Most people came to solve common problems, such as another - repair requests, insurance events and so on.
Papers with new leases are received in Ostrava in postal boxes by majority tenants from a total of 44 000 flats of RPG portfolios from mid-November.
RPG Flats in letters suggest an increase in rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special barrier to new rents was opened on 18 November at the client center.
"It's been going through a week, so it's only in the beginning," says the worker for a delay after a while of weight, when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bacal's former mining apartments are a local uplifting theme.
Prior to his election, he took him with a lot of shame, the Vice-President of Parliament and the Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, and now the local newspaper is filled with him.
"Twenties after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't change my board in the bathroom," the man said.
Most so far, pensioners come to see if they get a discount from rent if they sign up on time as RPG promises them in a special offer.
Half a discount on February's rent will also be received by other tenants who will sign a new contract by December 15.
The Havířov's "deregulative" counter, but the questions are definitely not ignored.
"From yesterday 360 clients here for rent for 2011 were only about 40 to 50 people," estimates the worker's opposition.
The RPG proposes individual negotiation on the web and its walls where necessary.
However, if both parties fail to agree on the lease, an independent court will have to determine it.
"It is not about threatening, but about information about only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," warns RPG on his website.
"No one will judge here," he thinks one of the RPG Flats workers and a man on the street outside of the client center gives her part of the truth.
"I have a pension of 13,000, and I have five thousand left to eat, and I don't have to judge," he says.
I mean, it's not like the worker's work is really the only thing that's gonna happen.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people probably wait," he thinks.
The regulation of rents ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Apartment is their increased economic necessity.
"The current rent still does not reach even the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Apartment, that the very angry tenant extorted by the neglect of the housing fund, according to the homeowners, is the main reason for increasing rents.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010 RPGs could invest four billion apartments, for four years from 2011 to 2014 it is to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging by the ceiling opposite the pomprated seats of the Havířov waiting room yet repeats several red highlighted information.
"The 2011 rent increase by 15% and less concerns 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG flats."
"And it will always be the most about $7.50 per square meter and a month," it will appear on the screen.
Only 400 flats from the portfolio RPG raises the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is an increase from extremely low amount of CZK 19,66 per square metre," warns RPG.
At 2600 flats next year, the rent will remain the same.
RPG Flats promises that deregulation will not lead the tenants to jump, but will be broken down in four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) will put the company back in apartments, mainly into heat savings - new windows and warming.
First of all, they're supposed to get people who are going to sign up an agreement to raise rents.
The office also includes kindergarten, architects understand.
Avriopoint Administrative Building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect that he would also hide a minischool with everything that belongs to it - with colored walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, she can be visited by children of Arch.Design employees.
The project-architektonian company Arch.Design, whose ateliers took up a number of major Brno buildings, counted with space for her corporate minischool since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs almost 90 people mostly at the age of Babyboom and cares about getting women designers and architects back to work quickly.
Together with the possibility of reduced ties, kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers its employees under the social program.
The stairwells and architects thus have the opportunity to combine demanding work with the child care.
The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs managed to get a European Union subsidy and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company minischool is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human resources and employment and state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (the subsidy amounting to CZK 2,8 million) they could buy equipment and equipment and provide qualified personnel and operating for two years.
After exhaustion of the financial subsidy (2 years) Arch.Design has an obligation for 3 years to run a mini-school for its own costs.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and was strongly assisted by Economy Rating.
Care is provided by qualified staff, a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry daily care for children, and children can go to school without age limits, yet most of them are older than 3 years old.
Because it's a "minor" thing, only five children may be present at the same time, but more can be removed during the day.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of the hierarchy of positions in the company.
Although this is an individual education and care, the software supplement in the minischool is comparable to the pre-school pre-school framework programme.
Children not only play here, but are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation for school benches, English is also taught.
Class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with computers that can use children.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their children at any time and suffer from the stress situation with the late invitation of children from school away from their parents' workplace.
Thus parents use working hours more productively.
No wonder the employee - employer’s natural loyal relationship is created here.
Arch.Design thus ranked on Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are friendly to the family and through this program enhanced personnel marketing.
House with bones is fascinating even after 100 years. Look in the interiors from Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a real lizard, the stair is like the vertebrae of dinosaur and the balconies are open with fish mouth.
This is the Casa Batlló house in Barcelona from the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the locals, thanks to his organic shapes, he earned the nickname House from bones.
Organic shapes, wild colours, unusual use of stone, shards of ducks and mosaics, façade resembling the suffrages and ubiquitous soft curves, all of this is typical for the Art Nouveau Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house is disintegrated by dream lines, delicate colors and textures that resemble nature and animals.
In detailed observation, geometricity, rhythm and precise order are seen.
In the night the whole facade of home sounds even more dramatic, it is lit so that the impression of the shine of color is even strengthened.
The hanging and cutting of shapes with the same measure appears in the interiors.
Wood in waves copy windows frames, rails, decorative door elements, ducks and rails.
The house Batlló, which stands in the district of Eixample on the busy shopping street Passeig de Gráča No 43, was built by reconstruction of the house from 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction was two years old and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, rich industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on waking up old buildings and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The house of Casa Batlló but Antoni Gaudí did not propose himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol cooperated with him.
At his designer board there were decorations for representative property owners and using mosaics on the facade.
Many other artists and artists worked on the facade.
The joint work at the top of Casa Batlló's house started with successful cooperation with Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá and Park Güell, in which other Gaudí works are.
From the locals, he served from the back to the finish, thanks to his organic shapes the nickname "The House of the Church".
Others started calling it "the remote home" because of a specific window-opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building is similar to the sword of St. George, patron of Katalánska.
The hidden religious motives also contain other sculpture elements of the construction.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for his time with air conditioners and typical chimneys.
The bizarre may seem their 40-degree slope.
In creating Gauda, he absolutely did not respect the construction regulations and did not let them tie up.
At the beginning of the construction project, although he received a building permit from the city, the given information about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city council was reborn and applied for repairs.
For example, the counsel was upset by the fact that the construction interfered with the pillars as well as the public sidewalk.
On the contrary, only fifteen days after the challenge of the city part, Josep Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) a permit to rent two top floors of the building.
The owner moved into the lower floors himself.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social salon and on the third floor a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented by jewelry store.
The whole six-story house is working through a stairwell, which can only be built on the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the removal of all right angles and direct lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the living door and a larger company together can communicate easily without at the same time keeping the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
The house with Gaudí's reconstruction also acquired a non-traditional roofing and two additional floors.
Gaudí's play is also impressive with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which are laid on the inner court, and lightbulbs.
The game of two colors adds maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was sufficient to simply bet on the principle that white reflected light more than the dark, which on the contrary is absorbed by the sun's rays.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house, the most spacious and efficient apartment is made available to the public.
The owners decided for this step until 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the 100 50th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
At the tour, they insisted because they found that it was a very convenient business and, in addition, they extended the tours to common and substation spaces, including roof terraces.
The entrance to the sights is certainly not negligible, it amounts to 16,50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20 percent discount.
The total exceeds significantly the price of entry to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you need to quickly make friends with some of the residents of the worker and visit it directly at home.
How to choose mattresses and grates: women have requirements other than men
There's no good frame of beds, but the quality of the deck, that is, mattresses and grates, they give the basis of really good beds.
However, they must complement harmoniously to suit a particular user.
When you choose, you decide a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health status, and gender owners.
Also important is the type of interior in which matress and grates take place.
A typical example?
Maybe weekend cottages, where they don't regularly sink, are not suitable latex mattresses, because they're more "heating".
In addition, they have significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to regularly turn them around.
If they don't have a lot of ventilating channels in their core, and still lie on a hard plate, they hold humidity: they could also appear under them mold.
There's also a habit to decide when to choose.
Who spent a long time abroad, where they often use a lot of high mattresses with a softening layer, it will be hard to feel good at low and hard surface.
"More than all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they wouldn't sleep here."
"On their bare shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with softening layer of lazy foam."
"These are recommended even for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they are badly accepting,information from joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamkiková, who specializes in chamoised furniture.
Many hockey players, but also other customers, therefore, were looking for a mattress with lazy foam years ago.
"Today it's okay, the suitable mattress has Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be the NHL guy to appreciate the lazy foam.
This "wilight" works easily.
It optimizes its fatness and shape according to absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, at night, you're not gonna flip around like you're after a tough fight.
Just sleep better.
The white foam also works as protection against prognosis.
When selecting the size of mattress to your height add even longer feet, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm so need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm in double, i.e. 180 cm together.
At least 120 to 140 cm is recommended for individual beds, for example for singles.
For comfort and possible visit.
"Jinak is a rule for width of bed simple: when lying on the back you should have hands comfortablely covered in the elbow," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the characteristic of the Cech of the chaplains and decorators, which has been dedicated to healthy sleeping and ergonomics of furniture for many years and is presented in professional schools.
In a double bed, each of its own grates and mattresses need, but here, careful shopping to sweeten the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, there will be nothing other than putting grates in different heights, but you don't have to do that with each frame of bed.
The foam mattress should have a height of at least 14 cm, a spring bone type of at least 15, of which at least three centimetres are counted on the shape and duplicating layer.
"You must not feel the spring at the touch of your hand or getting on the mattress," warns Helena Prokop.
Every mattress requires a certain type of grate.
All-rounded beds, when mattresses and grounds are like a grown-up Siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are miswinding, they cannot be washed up, which is now common.
And since we normally drink 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat during the night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will start to resemble one large (and blocked) plug.
For this reason, experts refuse advertising slogans for lifelong mattresses of up to 25 years, or even lifetime guarantees.
But it has its own butt.
Therefore, advice from sellers: at mattress widths of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work sensory coating do not give up, but add a mattress guard that can easily remove and wash.
Even though the covers are usually made today with mattresses around the whole perimeter, so after disintegrating we get two parts (for washing and size washing the washing machine very important!), yet it could manipulate larger types (and at one person) while reading to resemble fighting light weight in the ring with heavy.
Do you have a solid board in your bed instead of a gutter?
Never!
Maximum for a bed intended for one night visits.
However, the board still has (if it no longer has) ventilation holes and use mattresses with a spring bone and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (of which).
Polyurethane mattress doesn't belong on such grounds.
In the non-placement lamelas with 14 to 18 lamels will be suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (a combination of latex and coconut), but you will always be paid grates with a larger number of lamels, 28 and more, where lamels in the box area are doubled and can be adjusted.
The positioning lamelal grates do not include mattresses with a spring bone because they do not respond on the position.
The so-called shoulder wheel can also be enjoyed in addition to setting up the lamel tube.
It's a special grab of lamel, which allows you to push, or even clone the lamele in such a way that the shoulder sleeps nicely "storage".
For men who have "a ram across their backs" definitely important thing.
It is even remembered by manufacturers of mattresses who began to use the softening zone in the field of arms in the "men".
Women also remember - those once again supply the softer surface in the places of the hip.
For the most demanding customers are designed for wings or wafer grates with so-called multitorzní pérázním.
Pressure spreads down to more points and decreases voltage.
But be careful, once you use the right mattress and the grate of the wrong pillow (big and "suffened"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow is to support the head and the tip only interfere with the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
For example, 50 x 60 cm is recommended as a suitable size, which is preferred in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be equal to (with a shoulder knee of grate or softened zone in the mattress) the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have original silencers filled with grass, after all, something in common.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least mixed materials.
Trend is just with the mattress bio.
Oil raw materials, of which polyurethane foam is produced, are replaced by natural oils such as jump and soy.
They're using all the well-known producers now.
"The bio at the mattress means that the core is made of material of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vysekek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also enjoy microcapsules to release fresh aromas of forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While men "cool" plant extract from the shores to make the cover absorb warm and cool the body, women, on the contrary, the covers "tops".
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, so it's a weaker sex warmth.
Tonight's favourite?
The mattress made of cold foam (has bigger pores with broken cell structure, is so more breathtaking than normal polyurethane and offers even better elasticity.
The combination of different types of cold foam and "green" foams arise from multi-zone mattresses, which exactly know where the head, bed and heel are to be.
For quality mattress you will pay seven thousand crowns and higher.
Those that meet health parameters have a lower VAT rate are taken as health aids.
He first reached Gumotex in the Czech Republic on this advantage.
It's not easy to save on mattresses and grates.
Sometimes it is possible to use some of the events of manufacturers or vendors who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a sewn memory foam Memory foam Memory into the cover for 11 990 crowns.
However, the second one can be purchased free of charge.
Éru of lazy or viscoelastic foam with an open cell structure and high density launched "cosmic" at the rate of Tempur material.
He originally developed as a material for NASA, because at the start, astronauts were exposed to enormous overload.
The temperature in the heat softness, in the cold, is on the contrary.
So the warm human body adapts perfectly and lays down optimally its pressure.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of prognosis, but also to increase comfort in sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are not only used on mattresses, but also on medical products, such as special pillows under the legs that lighten the leg and vein system.
For example, domestic producers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and so on.
People's tracking instruments want more and more parents, so they want to put their children back together.
Fear of the own child brings more and more people to the idea of watching over GPS.
The system originally created to search for cars can also monitor the movement of people, helping, for example, in cases such as the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anita Janatková.
The device is about as big as a sulphur box, soon but can only be large as a watch.
A lot of people scared off the case of the lost Anika and began to go in the middle of ways to protect their children better.
Even at the price of disrupting their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that it is not a spy, but another means of reducing the likelihood of becoming a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of the tracking equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that in a certain case, abuse of such devices may occur, even if someone who doesn't know about it is involved, but we haven't met with such a case."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
He believes that a child should always know what purpose a "crab" serves and how it is used in case of emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child wants nothing like that, he'll just get rid of it.
"Even very young children prove great creativity in how some things will lose when they don't want to be under control."
"Very expectations were used earlier in parents to create cell phones, but they can be switched off as well as these tracking devices," Bočková says.
In its view, it is also disputed whether such an establishment would actually help in the event of assault.
"As for the intended kidnapping, the perpetrator will practically always ensure that the child has no electronics to reveal his location with him."
"Now it's a phone."
"As soon as the tracking device expands, they will look for it, because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In such a case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psycho.
However, it admits that such equipment may help in the event of an uninterrupted attack by pedophiles.
According to Robert Čeha from RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and individuals, even if there is an attack on the immediate destruction of the tracking device, its presence can help.
"The order may be set for regular dispatch after a certain period of time."
"If damage occurs, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"The more expensive devices have built-in clonometers, so even if a man slips away and remains stationary, he will send out the device immediately warning with the position given," says Czech Republic.
According to him, a similar service can also take smart mobile phones with navigation where you need to record special software.
The problem of current tracking units is that it's either devices similar to those of the size of the sulphur box or smaller cell phones.
It's always the risk of losing them.
According to Pinina of Macro Weil, this is why the device is now testing as a normal digital watch.
"This will have the greatest advantage in the fact that any aggressor may not have to know the tracking device at all."
"Or he will recognize them after a while, and it may give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking equipment is developed into bracelets or trailers, they will still use the same technology as it is used to watch cars.
This is a combination of location detection through GPS (which use normal autonavigation) and mobile phone functions that report the current position of the car.
The army has a hotline that's going to get around Czech Republic, but it'll only last two years.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of cordage to launch explosives.
In the last year, the Ministry of Defense has delivered a string of 224 kilometers into the warehouses.
The military thus has supplies for 225 years.
The problem is, the durability of the cord is two, not more than four years.
The army bought the burnt lines from STV Group stock exchange, a.s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff, on grounds of buying such a huge amount of flammable line MF DNES, wrote that soldiers, during training, consume 60 kilometres of burnt-outs each year.
However, according to the calculations of the army pyramids, which MF DNES addressed, it shows that they would have to go through all the generals, officers in charge of the army, secretaries or cleaning houses each year.
Minister of Defence Alexander Vondr and Commander of the Army Vlastimila Picka do not exception.
That's the only way to justify the annual consumption of the army of 60 kilometers of fire.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, military supplies would have been enough for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, it is sufficient, for the basic training of each new professional, to the highest of two metres of the heat cord, as the experts say, to ensure fresh purchasing - even with increased consumption of women's or special units - supplies for the above 225 years.
The leaders of the rapid deployment of Minister Vondra recently complained personally that they had almost no ammunition in handarms, so the shootings are also limited for money.
Not to mention lack of underwear.
"It's not my head that they buy so many lighters from us again."
"But it's their decision, and they definitely know what they're gonna get."
"For us, the army is a good customer, who we are trying to accommodate as traders," says STV Group Sales Manager Jan Děecký.
spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, Jan Pejšek, justifys hundreds of kilometers of bought string, even by having supplies of this "munitions" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děecký of STV Group speaks only about four years of vitality of the tannery and police or military pyramids, even about two years.
"When perfect storage, it may also be four," says one of them, who does not want to publish his name as a soldier because of the criticism of the army.
After the end of life, each ammunition must test carefully whether it is reliable and does not threaten the soldiers to live.
However, these tests are not free and costs more money.
Another argument by the Ministry is a quantitative discount of 445 km of burnt lines.
"We were about 60 percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and four kilometres," spokesperson Pejšek said.
Only in comparison: the annual consumption of firing lines of police pyrotechnics, who destroy ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet army, has not been above 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police have always ordered only so much to use this ammo before the end of life.
It has proved itself to be the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can, moreover, get more modern, and therefore, more reliable types of ropes.
The Ministry of Defence has already had considerable difficulties with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of Warsaw's contract, when the two-seventh Czechoslovak army was preparing to go to Rýn.
The Czech one, according to the fireworks that MF DNES has addressed, is facing the same problem in a few years: it will liquidate hundreds of kilometres of old insurgents that today "lacino" buys.
To this day, I draw from the contacts that I have won through the competition
The winning place in the competition The Farmer of the Year helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell his hotel freszy.
The winner of the last year's competition, The Farmer of the Year became an eight-year-old businessman Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His story of success is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun loved traveling.
And in a foreign country, he realized that Liberec lacked quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
He bought a half-breeded house with five apartments out of foreign brigade savings and using a bank loan.
At the time he was a student of the third year of college, it was a great courage.
"The ratio between quality and price of accommodation in our country did not give me anything to try to do," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first refurbished apartment has begun to lease to foreign workers.
All profits were invested back into the house, which gradually turned to a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has gradually managed to open four boarding houses in Liberec, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star Pytloun design hotel until recently.
But this year, he's got another, same quality.
"We have a signed contract with the hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, where we sold our Franciszing concept and other interested in the Franciszez hotel Pytloun reporting," said last year trademan number one.
"And at this sale of licence to operate the hotel was very much involved in the victory of the Farmer of the Year," Pytloun admits.
The victory brought him greater knowledge and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People met me on the streets, often congratulated me on additions, and I must say that it was pleasant," he recalls.
Participation in the competition definitely recommends to all those who are trying to do something.
There is no need to win, and every visibility is good.
He says he's still drawing on contacts and familiarities that he might not have gotten to.
"With some of the competition I started trading regularly."
The glory associated with success, he thinks, was a bit of a result for every employee.
And he's got about 70.
"I see greater loyalty and pride in being involved in something of general recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of the good work of all of us together."
"Only my name is put forward," said Luke Pytloun today modestly.
A quieter year than we had in Farmetu
The euphoria out of the victory quickly cut out the impact of the crisis.
But the winner’s aim is to make the Farmet’s time worse.
For the first prize in the last year of Vodafone Company last year, the owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žďárský, arrived in the Slovak house last year.
The jury then appreciated the efforts by which he built from a small tool shop in Česká Skalica company with hundred million turnover.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my co-workers and has increased our confidence for the fight against competition," said the winner last year.
At the beginning of history, Farmet was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered to father Karl Žďárski to rent a small workshop as compensation for the communist seized property, he did not long hesitate, refused his career at the company where he worked, and with a couple of friends around his dad set up a company on plastic baths.
Soon later, they began specializing on vegetable oil presses.
After 18 years, it became the largest producer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Greater awareness even among the non-professional public has been achieved by the company after the successful success in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to feel Farmet's brand much better, but also foreign partners have begun to appreciate that they cooperate with a company that has achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
However, last year was not only in the Euphoria sign of victory.
The valuation was based on the company’s economic results by 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And that year, 2009 was the hardest year for selling mechanical goods.
The crisis, which has not yet been affected by citizens, has already stopped its investment projects and started to reduce the purchase of new machines and technologies.
"The situation, of course, did not avoid us."
"The troubles fell by 40 percent, we had to cut production and there was also release," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must sometimes be able to make such unpopular measures.
But the situation was managed and the company remained profitable, even less than before the crisis.
However, investments in research and development have not been reduced in Farmetu.
"From the subsidies we have built a research and training centre, we have strengthened presentations at international fairs, we have won the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The markets are again growing and with the number of new employees.
"New winners wish a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
Prosecution of the senseless regulations
The discussion of Absurdit of the year is a fourth part of the business speech.
Some senseless regulations have already been abolished.
An infamous winner of the next year's Absurdite survey has become an obligation to carry documents to the office, which are also accessible online to officials.
It has been decided by more than a third of less than four thousand votes.
For example, social security administration required a copy from the Commercial Register, even if an official can get it with two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the survey, it's going to change.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer require an extract from the trading register in checks on insurance payers," said the spokesperson of ČSZZ Jan Buranovová.
Shine on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and make sense of the Absurdity of the Year competition senseless.
This is the fourth part of the business talk organised by the Economic newspaper and there is an increasing popularity among the public this year.
If there were about three thousand votes in the vote last year, it was nearly four thousand already.
And there's no wonder the various legal obligations that are just serving to keep business are still enough and enough.
"We are in the world's leading places," says Karel Havelek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and tradeists of the Czech Republic.
Unification of business has become the cause of all governments in recent years.
However, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving compared to the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has placed itself in its 74th position in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
Absurdity of the year was first announced in 2006 and every year it takes place according to the same scenario.
The administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can be reported every year from April to the end of September, when the end of the competition is the end.
The web address www.firmakroku.cz is used to log in after the contest organizer selects seven candidates for an "anticenum" and lets the public vote for it via the internet during October on www.firmak.cz/absurdita and www.ihnd.cz.
Absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
By this year, the survey was registered more than a hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and a regulation of lacking sense.
The tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also by trade unions and journalists.
Between the "finalists" of the competition, for example, there was a requirement that cars for the maintenance of motorways and speed roads pay tolls, or that businesses with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven proposals is published on the competition page.
The announcement of a competition that takes place at the beginning of November at Wenceslas Square in Prague is part of the hapenning, which is regularly attended by the personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, in this culmination, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Professionals of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kožíel, President of the Economic Chamber of the Czech Republic.
"Hospodářská prosperity cannot work where the state throws business sticks under its feet, therefore it is my goal to cancel at least three ten paragraphs each year, which today are just unnecessary complications of business," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocuorek.
The attempt to cancel a pointless regulation does not go unnoticed.
In 2007, people were most wronged to report three days forward to the Trade Office in a place where a permanent establishment, a plan to go with a stand for exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation has been removed by a new trade law.
The second most voted duty in 2007 that was announced by the Labour Office for its foreign staff service trip in the range of up to 30 days has been removed by law on so-called green card.
And by the three of them all good.
Absurd of 2009 was the regulation of physiotherapy to have a large mirror, refrigerator and two palpable weights in the office.
This year, the Ministry of Health's decree was mitigated - the duty of having a refrigerator fell off.
The new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are valued.
New this year, the fifth year of the Competition of Hospodářské noviny is the category called Responsible Company of 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impact of their business and promote socially responsible activities," said Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the observor and guarantee of the competition, as well as the rebel competition of the year.
By this year's first year of this special sub-category, Vodafone Company's main competition 2010 has been signed up to companies that are not successful in business with the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be published on a separate article.
Although the object of their activity differs from the other diametrically, aid and consideration may be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people and, elsewhere, personal problems or health of own employees.
For example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the responsible company in the Pardubian region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of the foundation fund for hendikeped children for 17 years.
The paper company from Poděbrad, which has more than 70 percent of its disabled employees, has received the title of the Responsible Company of the Central Bohemia Region and Vodafone Company of the year has been placed in the region as third.
In Olomouc, MiRyz Soft’s accounting firm, which introduced a flexible working time, won the accounting year, also reduced to an average of 35 hours a week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury's title has also been granted by the jury for buying priority from Czech producers, supporting civil activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycled as much as possible so that our business and administration have as little impact on the environment," explains Little Ryznar.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from Ústecky region thinks of the health of its employees and has given them an ergonomic chair and keyboard to each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by the local workshop at corporate events.
"In addition, we support the foundation of a person in distress who helps the local Roma community specifically," says Ondřej Suchý.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activities of Praní and cleaning from the Region of Karlovy Vary, which help its employees in the form of superstandard bonuses.
"With us again we give food contributions, transportation, increased qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapáč of the Brno Construction Company Time, winner in Moravia-Silesian Region.
In the category of Responsible Company of the year, all the regional finalists of Vodafone Company of the year were automatically registered and sent the questionnaire questions to the applicant by 15 August at the latest.
Inadvertently completed or incomplete questionnaire replies were then excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If representatives of the contestants have not answered questions, the company responsible for the year could not participate in the competition, but they are not disqualified from the "main" contest Vodafone Company of the year."
"It is not possible to login only into this competition because it is a sub-category of the main competition of the company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizer agency Bison & Rose.
On Land Fund in Pilsen police arrested in public competition
In the Land Fund building in Pilsen last days, anti-corruption police have been arrested.
The restaurant detectives have imposed on a local businessman in the media sector and on the trader with the real estate of Luboš G.
He reportedly tried to manipulate the currently ongoing public competition to settle the restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition was obtained by a particular buyer.
That one was supposed to pay half a million crowns to Luboshi G.
"I can therefore only confirm that the police are pursuing one person for overcoming public contracts and at a public competition," said Pávo, Chief of Plzeň State Representation Antonia Zelná, with no further details regarding ongoing investigations.
Six-four-year-old policemen released themselves in 24 hours.
In view of the minimum official information available, how he could influence the public competition can only be speculated due to the minimum official information.
The spokesperson of the Land Fund Lubomír Black, on a request from the Rights Department, stated that they had indeed been arrested at a detached workplace in Pilsen during the public competition.
"It was a client, not our employee," she said.
According to the Black Act, the public competition has the right name "The invitation to tender for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and is held where more legitimate applicants are interested in the land offered.
"These people in the context of the challenge offer a higher value for their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the value of the property destroyed."
"By the demands offered, the order of the acquirers and the Land Fund shall then transfer the property to the person who has offered the highest claims," explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Luboš G. obviously had information about who came to the challenge, and because he himself is also a legitimate person, because he bought a number of restitution claims, he offered the buyers to land that he would not participate in the competition.
He was probably incarcerated for it.
That would explain that he had so much money in detention.
Luboš G. had superstandard contacts with PF in Pilsen in the past.
He elaborated in a case of former PF commander Václav Sankot, who was criminally prosecuted for issuing land in a replacement restitution to which the building had already been decided.
That is when Luboš G. obtained from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the arrival magistral was to be built into the Borská Pole industrial zone.
Later, it was very convenient to change them with the magistrate behind the house in the historical center of the city, which was worth much higher.
That's when the town hall had to come to it, because otherwise, by blocking the land, the building would be in danger.
Houses will pay hundreds of months to live
Domesticities will have to pay for not only all kinds of energy, but also water and 100, heat supply and demand from January.
So families will have to pull out of wallets from January to hundreds of crowns a month more than now.
The electricity will raise up to 4.6 percent, the gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, until ten percent in some cities you will have to pay for water supply, and many times it will also supply central heat.
Electric recovery should result in households in flats every year by a stororoon drain rather than now.
At the same time, all major suppliers have reduced their prices, and there is a significant increase in support of renewable energy generation, especially photovoltaics.
The gas, however, can be subdued slightly, at a time when people are most sinking and having the highest consumption.
In addition, hundreds of crowns must also be counted annually.
While electricity and gas travels all over the Republic, the change in central heating prices differs from place to place.
The price increases are mainly planned for larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kralove will pay from January for a central heating of about 50 crowns a month extra, by more than 1000 crowns a year to pay families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague are again threatened to give them more than 9 percent of water and 100 percent, in the event that the city will increase rent from infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, it'll pay $8.8 percent.
The price in Prague, however, will continue to be included in the full-time comparison between lower prices.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are now among the highest, it has a watery and 100 percent increase.
For example, rental prices in 450 000 rental apartments may increase, where regulation has ended since January.
For example, CPI Apartment, which owns about 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase its rent by up to 100 percent from January onwards.
Those who will not agree with the new foreign rent are going to give society to court.
The regulated rent that people pay in about 300,000 flats could increase by up to ten percent next year.
Czech children are drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is made of fashion, works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, an exceptional and better brand of whisky stolen by parents.
These are drinks whose drinking ends most often in the care of drunks, which have not yet been for 15 years.
An exception are not children who are treated repeatedly from monkeys in the hospital.
This is based on the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases at the hospital’s child wards.
"Some beers or wines are totally unsustainable because they last a long time before you get drunk."
"Trend is certainly a hard drink," said Luděk Pelikán, the Mayor of the Children's Department of Hospital Hořovice in Central Bohemia.
"If they manage to pull a bottle out of their dad's closet, it's a whisky, otherwise it's over the fernet and vodka."
"The water has the advantage of pouring it into a juice and not so much to feel," explained the primer.
And for the truth, the spokesperson of the Faculty Hospital, Molol Eva Jurin.
"Most often it's a fernet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slivovice that they brought from their home," said Jurin.
According to Prime Minister Pelikana, 13 or 14 years old, pirates at hospital income are a fairly common phenomenon.
In front of Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he has been working for ten years on pedagogy in Motole, where the ambulances tie the ponies from a wide range of places.
"One girl lay with us about four times."
"The surgeon began at twelve years when they brought her to us with 3.5 more blood alcohol in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at a exhibition site in Holesovice for a dance party."
"It is interesting that her mother did not find it odd that she did not know about her daughter for 48 hours," the prime minister was surprised.
At the moment, parents or even their considerable tolerance to drink their own offspring are considered the main cause of growing child drunkness.
However, according to the experts in children, addiction cannot be spoken.
"With the concept of an alcoholic, it means a few years of chronic alcohol addiction with all the phenomena that belong to it, and that's not in children."
"With those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is more of a typical unsustainable family-social background," explained Prime Minister Pelikán.
According to spokesperson Jurin this year at the pediatric clinic in Motole hospitalized about 40 drunk children by mid November.
However, statistics only get to those with severe intoxication that had to stay in the hospital.
Children’s drunks who take their parents after an outpatient treatment, or bring them home to the police, do not count.
Except when the kids just sit down after school and drink a bottle of chickens, there are three seasonal challenges according to Pelikan, for which we can rely: witches, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"It's either singing grief from bad convictions or, on the contrary, celebrating the beginning of the holiday."
"On every witch, I saw seven children drunk at once," said Pelikán.
The monkey who spends the night detoxifying under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically at an advantage compared to who will suffer an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Early headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency are caused by an infusion infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing by the organism.
"They're actually better because they're having a beautiful evening experience and a good wake-up call and nothing hurts."
"Only they are confused of where they are," admits Pelikán, while sometimes spoils patients with a pleasant mood at least counting the costs required by their treatment.
The transport with ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will also come to tens of thousands of crowns.
"At times I applied it as a educational means, when I then counted on the vision of these children how much their drunkness stood and could also spend the whole summer at the brigade to earn one party," he added.
However, according to the health insurance company, health insurance companies believe that they would not be involved in the regression procedures in which parents would not be subject to treatment costs in the case of children's drunkards.
Two aircraft L-159 are first in foreign hands in Spain
Two aircraft L-159 of the total five pieces for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Spain’s Seville on Tuesday, where Casa - EADS is established.
It is the first time that the machines of this type appeared in the property of someone other than the Czech Army.
In the foreign region, they were only on exercises or demonstration years.
It is a two-digit version of L-159T1 which has so far operated the Czech army and which have been lethabitable.
The remaining three machines are uniform L-159.
So far, Omnipol has been ordered in Aeru Vodochody and Trade Agent - has already taken over them last week.
When aircraft physically rides from Vodojód, according to Jan Pejšek of the Defence Department, it is not known yet.
"The L-159 aircraft have been dismembered from long-term aircraft deployed without further deposits and investments by the Ministry of State."
"The two-digit L-159T1 has been converted in the current state and shape," said Pejšek.
He added that the army without two-digit aircraft will not remain because the Ministry of May 2009 signed a contract with Aer Vodochody worth 200 million crowns for the reconstruction of four non-needed machines L-159 into two-digit machines.
One new aircraft took over the army in July, the other will take over until the end of this year.
According to Pejsek, the EADS has undertaken to put aircraft into the arms of some of the alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is a customer of L-159 aeroplanes and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"There are therefore things for the customer how this matter will be implemented," Pejšek said.
The economic newspaper said that, for example, the Spanish army of L-159 is not interested.
The exchange of five L-159 for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of another three aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved by the government of Mirka Topolánka last year.
The Ministry of Defence has not written for the purchase of the selection procedure and has addressed the EADS directly.
This defence leadership argued that the exchange would support future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and only uses 24, the rest would want to sell.
The purchase of Casa planes is likely to have a court record.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court of First Instance because it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European thinner and not by addressing one producer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aeroplanes, and the last should fly to the Prague airport of Kbela during 14 days.
Longer index finger than a ring indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have index finger longer than a ring are exposed to a minor risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer in the middle.
It could be related to the level of male testosterone hormone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under 60," said Ros Eeles, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The breast could thus help determine which men should undergo a test for prostate cancer, especially in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors, such as the family health burden, added Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she followed colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and simultaneously more than three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had index finger marks on their right hand less than a ring.
They had the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same as long.
However, in the case of those who had the index finger longer than the ring, this risk decreased by 33 percent, for men in the 1960s it was even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers - formed during the prenatal period - seems to reflect the different levels of sex hormones in which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone matches the longer tipper.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is supporting growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, for ČTK, said he knows about this study in general, but he does not seem to know that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer was "comprehensively proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On the roadways and walkways there is usually a cold snow, the roadways in many places have been driving all night.
It is closed in the morning by highway D5 between 89 and 93 km in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of freight and passenger cars and also stands at D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
News told the dispatcher of Central Automoclob (UAMK).
There was a truck crash on a 9-mile radius, two trucks crashed on a 93-mile notice, the accident claimed injury.
Several cars ended up in the ditch as well.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway to 185 km in the direction of Prague.
There were two stones down there.
Drivers should ride right behind Brn at 190 km or go through Brno and then drive to 182 km on Kývalka.
There are several-meter colonies.
Also on the D11 motorway is an accident, immediately upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague there is a multicentimetre snow layer, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
The cars are created, for example, in Proseku, and are also closed by Štěrbholská.
The most secure means of transport is the subway.
Tramvaje runs late, for example, on the line between Karl's Square and Míru Square.
At 8:00 a.m., the Prague crisis staff is about to be sat down again.
Railways and airports are also facing problems.
The Czech railways had to cancel seven fast connections because of the snow.
Problems, for example, have a track from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
The airport of Ruzyně was closed from Wednesday 11 hours at night to five o'clock in the morning.
Most roads in southern Moravia are already mobile, but only with increased caution.
In Vyškovsk there are three side roads, in Brno there are snow languages and in Brno there is a need to climb some roads in higher places of snow chains.
Vyškovsko belonged to the most affected places.
There are currently closed roads: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Milešovice.
There's gonna have to be more frescoes in their protrusion.
When they leave, they can't be estimated yet.
Caution in the White Carpathian region is needed in Hodoninsk.
On roads that are there to protect nature, which are kept only by inert sleeping, lie down to a five-centimetre layer of snow, said the ČTK.
In the Czech Republic it fell from two to ten centimeters of snow, most snow fell in northern Bohemia, many to 18 centimeters.
In Moravia-Silesian Region there were about 15 centimeters of snow.
Snowing in the Czech Republic gradually stops.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army has imposed a new "chitrou" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the code name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and change the game in their favor.
A new weapon is kind of like a little super-travelled cannon.
Its projectile directs lasers with accuracy on several meters.
Special 25 mm cast iron, developed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, actually function as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only at impact but at any point in their ballistic paths.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who is hiding behind some obstacle, wall or trenches.
Shora is usually not protected, and when murderous rains of steel shells stand on him, it can eliminate him from the fight.
According to Richard Audetta, who participated in the development of XM-25, the new rifle is the first gun to use "smart" technology.
"The warrior basically deals with her by finding the target, sending him a laser beam, which determines the distance, so she gets the exact point, according to him, adjusting the direction and pressing the tap."
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the gun will charge and blow the shot at a distance of 543 meters plus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs
The Fujitsu consortium will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the existing administrative building to Marienbader-town in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu company will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As on Wednesday he told the giant in the field, which specializes in computers and maintenance, moving 400 men and women in July next year's 400 men and women's jobs from a former administrative building on Marienbader-town in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in the part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the French spokesperson, there should be another 100 jobs of the company which are still divided into the region in due course.
The offer of rent was said to have been very attractive and large-scale offices in Astro Park have said that they are more consistent with the working way they work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only in rent.
A comprehensive member of Bernd Wagner said, "in Frankfurt-Nederrad we found a central seat with excellent infrastructure".
Excellent connection to the airport is very important for global companies such as Fujitsu.
Recent moving of an important enterprise within the region gave rise to joy yesterday at the winners and disappointments in the losers.
Manager of the economic referent at Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that this was the way to get a "global player".
It's said to be a "fantastic expression of confidence in this site".
Fujitsu says it's fit for the city, housing is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Green), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The town was reported to have been informed in due time by the company's management of its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company" said Korwii.
Friendships, however, could not change the problems of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader-town.
The result was a decisive economic reason.
It is now a matter of preventing a long severance in such a prominent place.
"I hope he will be the owner and tenant of the cooperative building."
The house on Rathaus-town, which was used by Fujitsu so far, and the neighboring "Kline Verticile" belonged ten years ago together with other buildings on Marienbader-town to the most sophisticated construction projects of the spa town.
Between the station and the town hall, it was formed as a joint project of the city and a private designer called city entree, which was criticized by massive construction of areas that had previously served as a parking lot and also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001, an investment consulting company and Feri rating moved into the home, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu's computer manufacturer, which was still connected to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold in 2006 by the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu-concern from Tokyo is referred to as the third largest IT-provider in the world.
It offers for example computer and server companies available and also takes care of the necessary service.
Rýna and Mohanu branch is one of the largest employees in Germany, but Fujitsu is in Munich.
From Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Nederrad, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, another subsidiary in this site will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the administrative building Astro Park, 7,000 square metres were rented for this purpose.
In the complex - his name draws attention to the staric soiling, which is twenty-year-old, is located in addition to other central electrical and electronic industries.
Amazon Switch off the server - threats against Assangem
The Wikileaks are getting narrow.
Amazon Internet service shut down the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this has happened to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of secret diplomatic depressions.
The founder of the Wikileaks Assange is reported to be staying in the UK.
The Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is getting more pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their existing home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, he invited the prominent American senator Joe Lieberman other countries and businesses to boycott the Wikileaks.
And the founder of the Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is on the list sought by Interpol, is to be held up according to one newspaper paper in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon server."
"Free speech in the Free Country", the activists communicated the publication service with short Twitter reports on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, Amazon downloaded the Wikileaks' online documents from its servers.
Internet activists used to publish Amazon Web Service's secret diplomatic dispersals (AWS) so that they can handle the high number of accesses to documents.
With Twitter, Wikipedia explained this step: "Fajn - our dollars are now spending by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for the Wikipedias after Senator Joe Lieberman's co-workers made a search, released CNN television station based on Lieberman's information.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Home Defense threatened Amazon boycott, informed British 'Guardian'.
"I would like Amazon to take this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on the Wikipedias", said the senator.
Meanwhile, Lieberman called on the platform to prevent the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks act as illegal, inadvertently and recklessly, and thus being exposed to our national security and thereby endangering life on the whole planet", said one declaration by an impartial senator.
"No responsible company - either American or foreign - should Wikileaks help in their efforts to expand stolen material."
The founder of the Wikileaks Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities for suspected rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
On the basis of the report in London's newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain is holding off, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
An Internet activist has always called an investigation in Sweden for the intrigues of his opponents.
Wikileaks Kristinn Hrfnsson in London said there were threats.
"The final challenge was to murder Julian Assang."
That's why Assange is rightly concerned about his safety, said Hofnsson.
Therefore, the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hofnsson seems to have responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested that she be responsible for publishing Wikipedia for treason and executed.
In Canada, one advisor to the government of Stephen Harper, probably ironic, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use a "target aircraft".
In the meantime, she broke out between the White House and Assange's vocabulary.
American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, spokesperson, called it "a laughable and absurd" that Assange asked for a resignation from the Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton, if she is responsible for the recently published espionage challenge of diplomats.
"I am not absolutely sure why we are interested in the opinion of one person with websites," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than his website."
The U.S. government is now examining the safety of its databases widely.
The Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorist Measures Centre, Russell Travers, was appointed Deputy Director of the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of "reformed reforms in the structure" which are necessary after the publication of the report from the embassy to the Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine the ways in which the whole government exchanges and protects information.
The US government has also announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they should get into danger of publishing on the Wikipedias.
"We did everything we could to get into touch with them," said the spokesperson of the State Department Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them if it's necessary."
University of Iceberg
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are being prepared for a better year's period.
The basic course for future ice creamers, which lasts for three days, is great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where is the ice cream actually coming from?
Gelatier and Gelatio.
Gelatier, Czech slightly obsolete ice creamer, produces cream by all rules of Italian ice cream art.
Geltaio removes the ice cream from the cooling box, wipes it in the wafer and sells.
To find out, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But who wants to learn even more about ice cream doesn't "Gelato-University" by the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003 the manufacturer of ice cream machines established a university for ice cream from his machines to match high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts for three days, is great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
It also offers special special courses for chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream shop.
Someone longs for their new career in Midlife-Crisis, others weigh on the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves to move Slow-Food and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a corporate consultant, and she would like to start something of her own after years of stress work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian woman at home Julia arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive is not only a good taste, but also a silk hebliness and a good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training on the Southern and patriot cherry on the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it includes an even noteable dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserts basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large blender that warms everything with an electronic program of 85 degrees and then cools to four degrees immediately.
Then they turn on the machines with a tap and a pasterised white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The price is immediately covered by questions: Is it possible to produce ice cream only from natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can one experiment himself?
Luciano warns to get carried away in the spirit of time into the unknown.
Who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients", probably used stabilisers - mostly natural product, such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilisers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it gets hit and the customer eats the ice grain itself.
Certain variations of basic matter are holidays.
It's going to be a lot more tense with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes in the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweetener department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"The suppliers will try to force a lot of aromatized ingredients."
"But you should experiment simply."
Be a fruity sorbet with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or ice cream from white base matter that changes eggs into yellow cream and cocoa on the basis of all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now they may participate in the course for ice cream machines.
Luciano will allow them to produce always four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and locust ice creams - either with eggs or without eggs in basic matter, with more or less vanilla flavourings or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment shall also be conducted with fruity types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruity pyres - given the taste, it's not always better.
Ice-cream ice cream does not need to taste more nuts when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is produced by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Only until a balanced mixture lifts the proper taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerous task: If a peach pyre is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, you need extra sugar.
Luciano removes a device to determine the sugar content of the fruit (the virus measures the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables ease the numbers.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much body effort as before.
It does not only help the device for the automatic manufacture of basic material.
There's also a device that makes an ice cream mixture at the same time can go into cream and cool down to minus temperature.
In spite of all automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo is going to get his self, and he's also going down his fruity pyramids when he gets out of control with a huge blender.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time something like this happens."
Revers in Double Light
The European Food Authority Essa is associated with an industry that experimentes with genetic plants.
This charge has now been addressed by a group of Testbiotech experts, which is considered to be an independent institute for the estimation of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well," said Munich's boss Testbiotech Christoph Then on Wednesday.
The Head of the Efs Experts' Group for Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and other expert Efsa have had a contract with Ilsi's lobbyists for several years.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated in the decisive way in the Ephs control regulations for genetic plants and stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticizing Then.
Effs' prescriptions are reported to match all the Ilsi documents and thus bear the manuscript of industry, which should be controlled by the Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech points to conflicts of interest.
Recently, a high manager from Efsa has been transferred without additions or transitional time to the Swiss agri-gress Syngent - and thus changed sides.
Also the radio for medium Germany (MDR) recently revealed the EU's personnel link to control the industrial lobby, which gave rise to interest both the Ministry of the Environment and the EU Members.
Meanwhile, Essa cannot identify conflicts of interest.
He works with all the serious data, i.e. the industry, if they are highly high-quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts working for Ephesians are not required to have contacts with the industry.
But they have to be added.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It is referred to itself as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, to estimate the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts like Then criticize that they are currently holiday-related genetics of a changed plant in animals without any attempt to feed, and that they do not test the reaction of genetic plants to environmental effects.
"We want to know what, for example, the genetics that changed corn in the field will do," says Then.
Current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the whole genetic plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If they're not looking for risks, how could they be found?" Then asks the plaintiff.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees with that.
The scientific worker has been investigating the genetechnics since 1994 and currently working at the University of Technology in Zurich.
In this area industry is trying as much as in the US, now also in Europe more and more influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are no more scientists who would not be connected to the competition.
Most of the time, they don't publish studies that are critical to companies.
"The industry controls security research", says Hilbeck.
Stone alloys
Uli Gsell got himself some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he stood outside the train station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is known: in September, the swamps arrived and they began to tear down a large piece of northern wings.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands have demonstrated against the S21 billion reduction of the station.
When the construction stopped, most wings were destroyed.
Broken to 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crail of Crailsheim, soft rough stone, which was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He made some of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They can't disappear."
It smitten: "The strong and the poor stone, the simple, and the first-rate."
When he cut one, he smelled after a cigarette smoke.
She doesn't know what she's gonna do with those pieces yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The mark of the Stuttgart stones leads to the forest near Tübingen on the former dépony of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought everyone that was created during the storm in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they started to get angry or disappeared to the depository," he says in his office, a wooden box, which was a previously guarded house.
They tell him that they hired him and threatened him when, in September, in all the newspapers, it was worth buying the remains of the northern wing from a society that was demolishing.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he was not allowed to be demolished at all.
And when it's happening, it's the most reasonable thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then they took about 200 S-21-productives each one about 80 kilograms heavy block, price for a piece of 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also hope to return it during the reconstruction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, 25 large trucks loaded.
About half he's still in the woods, the rest of him's been sold a long time ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all over the corner and pulled away what went into the trunk and trailer.
The stones of the dispute from the Stuttgart have long changed into "twenties" or as the edges of herbs with herbs.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political insertion."
He's getting into his field car and going for a ride after his 20-haul kingdom.
He studied before law, he interrupted the study, later in biology, then he was interested in computers, and eventually became a stone merchant.
And a stone lover.
It's got 40000 tons of rocks stored.
He weighs his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old-stone merchant in the Republic.
He's driving.
In the snow there is an artisticly worked sandstone.
"One of them belonged to Marien-most in Dresden," he says.
The Sandstone of Labe, yellow, warm, excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're on our way up through the woods.
Shows the pile: red sandstone, earlier part of the station in Karlsruhe.
Go on.
"Good transvertin."
One day, they belonged to the Neckarstadion Tribun in Stuttgart.
There are stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt-travertin from the Police Presidium in Stuttgart, a red grenade from the Temple of Sankt Blasien, tuf from the hospital in Heilbron.
What a job to do, what a pain.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were manually crushed and transported by means of simple hammers and bull wagons, it will become completely respectful.
"It would have been scandalous if something like this were to go wrong."
He wasn't rich, he wasn't rich anymore.
But today, the stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, stonestones, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glasssmith and one gardener settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the remains.
In due time, he's got to go to Cologne.
They'll be saving rocks there, too.
Fighting talent for high-potentials
There's a lot of people at the refreshments.
16 students are pressed with salmon bread, tomato soup and sweetness.
Technical University of Braunschweig and automotive manufacturers Volkswagen invited students to engineering and design workshops.
Together with VW developers, they are supposed to talk about the future car here - and by the way – by the way, to get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to succeed in the race for the smartest heads, as well as VW, and betting on co-operation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible, recruit the most gifted graduates in the audience, before they get to the labour market and they will be interested in others.
Since universities do not issue any lists of the successes of their students, they try to discover exceptional talent in projects oriented to practice and gain them.
At TU Braunschweig, he tries to get talent the next day.
One young lady from the personal department gives out pens, rubber medals and plates with a VW logo.
He tells hopeful young talents about programs for practice, student jobs and suggests their way to the company.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see the benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"The VW can meet students at the same time, get to know the interesting candidates and think about who would be fit as a co-worker."
Such co-operation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is, he's so openly fighting for students.
"Jinak was more of a substantial professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from long crowds of candidates.
On the contrary, they must strive and strive to attract particularly highly qualified labour.
In particular, graduates of engineering branches have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the data of the Association of German engineers, the VDI remained in October unregistered 40,000 engineering positions.
And according to the predictions, the so-called lack of engineers will grow.
Roman Dykt for the talent hunt is behind the audit and advisory firm KPMG.
It organizes a demanding Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race where participants must find their way to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the US next year.
Participants may also check KPMG's branches and get acquainted with the company.
Before that, he will decide in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème will fly from many interested parties to the USA.
In the fight for High Potentials at universities, Dicts will still pay more stringent laws.
"We want to differ with our Race from the others."
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us."
Looks like Dict's talent hunter's lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants similar events last year."
"Some people will have a study soon and are planning to apply for work with us," he says.
In addition to direct calling on campus, small and medium-sized companies are usually presented on labour markets.
"We're trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"As for example on Intersolar", states Sitha Stübe, the head of staff department of Solar Technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the issue with young workers.
35 positions on the company’s website are currently being signed.
"Now it's complicated to take your seats."
"It takes a lot of time and money," he says.
Another possibility is contact with professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professionals inform us that it is possible for us to practice or write a diplomatic work."
Solar specialist doesn't have any expensive advertising actions.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Great companies often can't offer it," says the head of the personal department of Stübe.
In search of work, money is no longer a major role.
Flexible working hours, child care or good practice options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld settled in one study at Great Place to Work 55. place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, he asks his co-workers how they are satisfied with their work and work environment and follow the framework conditions of employees.
The head of the personal department of Stübe hopes that the placement will bring her points for the job interests.
"I believe interested parties are informed particularly about external evaluations of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy a good reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr Kriegler, that means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer leads through his own employees," he says.
This is called internal Employer Branding, i.e. the promotion of employers on the market within their own employees.
"Accommodated employees are the best ambassadors."
When the company takes good care of its people and they identify themselves with the company, then they'll do an ad from themselves to their employer between friends and friends.
"It's like a string game," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drills
During the coming years, they will not reach new oil wells in the Gulf of Mexico outside the US-Spolice State of Florida.
The Washington government issued an appropriate ban - and thus repealed with the final validity of the earlier plans.
New drills are not yet prohibited before the Atlantic coast.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar said it on Wednesday.
The reason for a strict ban that should apply for a minimum of five years is the explosion on the drilling tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Prior to this disaster, which cost 11 employees their lives and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama signaled on the pressure of the opposition and industry's willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
In doing so, the advocates try to reduce the dependence of the US on the supply of foreign oil.
To date, it is not clearly explained who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The center of criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted with billion applications.
The investigation commission that Obama has commissioned should submit during December.
In October, Minister Ken Salazar cancelled the ban on drilling, which was paid from the explosion.
They then submitted various oil companies’ applications for new drilling intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters by more stringent controls and strict security regulations.
At present, the control office, which has highlighted itself with many corruption charges, is being substantially reformed.
At the same time Obama announced that it would cancel the ecclesiastical tax evasion possibilities for oil and gas companies.
The industry now openly warns that tighter regulation will reduce the volume of processed oil in the Gulf.
"The main plans are the biggest brake for the growth of gas and oil industry", the result of the current survey in the field of advisory company BDO - before the Wednesday drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance still complains about uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what the regulation will change."
Investments in new mining projects are moving until appeal - at the expense of growth.
The tail area has burned down.
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like pump: billions of liters of leaked oil destroyed nature in the Ogoni region in Nigeria.
People are living in stealing, corruption, and illegal cooking oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," calms down the Journalist ecological activist: "Today, you get enough oil mud from the lens."
37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy who was hurling his breasts with water surrounded by smudges: the scene is working in a water gloss with rainbow colors almost nicely.
You can't see under the surface of a floating brown oil clot.
She used to collect enough tannery to the vessels, telling Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, water was slowly flowing completely dead.
Five years ago, a huge bottle of oil came out of a broken management area.
The fishermen of the nearby town of Bodo must fall for at least six hours to get to the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area located in the heart of the Niger delta belongs to one of the highest infected areas in the world.
On the road along the river of the mangrines with lots of side tides is only a significant whole range of trigger.
The boat engine cooks instead of light water with brown porridge and who sinks his hand into the water pulls oil fingers.
Mangal roots draw from the ground like black sticks of licorice, rarely occurring palms leave their leaves sadly hanging.
In vain we look for flocks of birds that normally occur in wet areas: As soon as the engine quiets down on the boat, it melts in earlier paradise, where it smells like pump, scary silence.
"What's happening here is ecological leadership of war," says Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health."
The comparison with the war is justified.
The area of Ogoni’s settlement is a battle field, which has been fighting for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe, here in the 1980s, formed the first resistance with later executed writer Ken Sara-Wiv, here had to stop Shell’s production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while the company is daily benefitting from a three-sized delta area of Switzerland with more than 5000 mining drills and 7000 kilometers of lead over two million barrels of black gold, lies an oil field in the Ogoni ladem area, for the concern this situation is very unstable.
Each few hundred meters are drawn from the water of the steel construction as bizarre statues: "Vanc Christmas Trees", so they are too tenderly called heads of drilling holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusty.
At any moment, a constant stream of oil into the water flows out of such a drilling hole.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion liters per 50 years have been launched in the delta ecosystem: Every year, the amount of oil that has been blown into the sea by Alaska in the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" crash 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes that are responsible for the continuing environmental disaster.
While Shell company refers to sabotage and organised oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, it speaks to environmental protectors about bursting heads of drills and leaks as the main cause.
Shell requires much less security regulations in Nigeria than in the world by custom, he called the US-American scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: Only a number of management malfunctions are said to be "some times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil soiled workshop under the wide sky, comes out of the mangarths of the characters: they are completely naked and to the neck of the oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected by the management, partly any scattered on the ground, fires on fire: illegal little refineries.
Oil's been heating up over the fire for hours, explaining Michael, the group leader.
First it comes out of the lead to the catch pot gasoline, later the drop at the end of the kerosin line and finally the oil.
This is how Michael and his four coworkers produce 300 liters each day: "We're gonna make 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The residents of the delta use the chronic lack of fuel in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
A mixed price of 40 cents EUR per litre of petroleum may still be overcharged by illegal producers: because they have free raw materials.
It comes from "bunkers" that connect to lead everywhere in the Ogoni area: according to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost daily in the entire area of the Niger Delta.
But only insignificantly a small part of the visually stored raw materials will illegally be used: The largest share will be filled with organised criminal networks, to which politicians and highly representatives of the military are to belong, to tankers and sell them on the world market.
The debate whether or not the population caused disaster and their intervention or the lax method of production considers the activist Apobari to be purely academic.
"If oil companies hadn't considered themselves intruders, and if they hadn't completely destroyed the life of fishermen, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, Ogoni's relationship is so depraved to Shell that it only seems to consider leaving the group: "Maybe other peoples like the Chinese show themselves as better."
Michael will be upset.
"Now's the time to disappear," says the muscle producer.
"Every minute soldiers can come."
If they were found by a special military unit, they'd be in no danger of prison, but a painful bribe.
Also, soldiers who usually come from the north country - like all Nigerians - want to benefit from raw materials.
"This cursed thing got our land all the way down here," says Akpobari.
Investigators discovered a dangerous construction error in A380 engines
A380 seems to have a major safety failure.
The investigators found a machine inspecting the emergency landing, a possible building error that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The airbus passengers of Qantas seemed to have been more fortunate at an emergency landing in early November than they had known before: the Australian Air Safety Authority found a major safety failure on the engines of some A380 machines during their investigations - and now warns against possible building failure.
Perhaps a failure would be difficult: this Thursday, in the declaration published by the ATSB Office, could be caused by cracks due to wear.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the airbus of Qantas, which had to land emergencyly in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British producer of turbines.
She explained the pleas in the Australian Federal Court of Sydney, which allows further legal action against the company.
Qantas Alan Joyce said that his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released, and they damaged the bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce described the damage to burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be traded worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with large aeroplanes equipped with the engines in question.
The security recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesperson of ATSB Martin Dolan.
The security gap was considered important enough to inform everyone in question.
After the emergency landing of Qantas machines, the airline left its fleet A380 for several weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left three of her eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa changed the A380 engine as a safety measure.
The two-storey plane is the largest personal plane in the world.
A national snowfall will cause chaos in transport
Germany all in white: almost all the country snowed during the night.
On many roads there are chaos, train connections and airplanes are affected.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: almost the whole republic sank at night during freezing temperatures of snow - which leads in many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and east, it lies in some places up to 15 centimeters of snow.
On several motorways and many roads is strongly restricted to transport.
At A7 in Flensburg, road service was still in place, but the new snow was unable to handle.
There was still a strong impact wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Navigation (BSH) is waiting on the Baltic Sea coast in Šlesvik-Holštýnsko in the morning of a stormy flooding with a water state of 1,2 metres above normal.
Snow curtains caused considerable problems in Saxony on motorways and state roads.
According to the centres of bad weather, Meteomedia was therefore the highest degree of alarm in Saxony, Switzerland.
From there, 30 centimetres of new snow, strong and fresh winds caused a breeze.
A few trucks and passenger cars stayed there last night.
In Saxony-Anhaltsk, police authorities reported great problems on roads.
On A2 caused the wind and snow to slow operation and traffic.
There was trouble in Durynsk about snowing on A4 and A9.
According to the German track, there is great trouble in Saxony, Saxony-Anhaltsk, Durynsk and North Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on tracks, overturned trees on tracks or broken upper lines and switches.
In Saxony, remote traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In a durynian Saalfeld he had to stop oneICE at Munich.
165 passengers got on the train from the firemen and rescuers of wool blankets, food and drink.
The snowy wind was blowing across the road.
Many years have been cancelled due to snow winds in large German airports.
According to the spokesperson of information centres about years have already been reported from Munich annulled years.
In Frankfurt nach Mohan was cancelled according to spokesperson Fraport for 40 years.
Road maintenance is in constant deployment.
There are only a few unconnected passengers at the airport, but 400 field beds are ready for them.
There have been accidents on many roads on Wednesday night.
In the evening, one truck driver died in a collision with a train on the railway crossing in eastern Holštynsk.
The engineer was slightly injured.
Due to the snowed road there was a similar accident near Nuremberg: there was also a truck caught on the rail crossing because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver died.
On the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuthu to Nuremberg remained closed until the morning.
And then one 30-year-old woman died after Aschaffenburg and her car turned on a slippery road.
But the Meteorologists have a good news: the snow will remain in the form of a light dust, and therefore it will also rise during the light waves of the wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only at the Baltic Sea will the quick winds of the power of the wind.
But it's going to be a big cold, but it's going to be going to be negative 15 degrees locally.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for towers-doublers
Deutsche Bank wants to say good-bye to its mark: according to one paper, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in the main headquarters of Frankfurt.
Real estate could cost up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its registered office: Towers-doublers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; while bankers have once again laughed at their old jobs.
But now he seems to want financial concern for renovation costs again - and he's looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, as reported by "Financeal Times Deutschland" with appeal to a spokesperson.
The speaker didn't name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We constantly examine whether it is more meaningful to own or sell real estate and then rent again", he said.
This is the largest credit institution in Germany once again giving up its business headquarters after a short time.
The Bank only took over the tower-doublers in mid 2007 for EUR 272 million from its own fund investors and then renovated them in a cost-effective manner.
Energy reconstruction has swallowed around EUR 200 million according to data.
I think the sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the news text, experts estimate the value of the well-known towers on the "Greenovers" at the price of around EUR 500 million.
The speaker said that it is not decided whether the building will again be sold to the assets of the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of mourners behind dead miners
More than 10,000 people worshiped the memory of the sleeped miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mines.
Still failed to release the dead because in chess the security situation is still complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a strong explosion in Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 years were flooded downstairs.
There was no trace of life in the chess where there was bad luck.
Because of high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, they were unable to retreat the rescue force for safety.
Second, the authorities and experts came out of the fact that miners no longer had a chance to survive.
Still failed to release the dead.
Now they worshiped the memory of dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, the southern island of New Zealand, ten thousand people were gathered for sunny weather.
They've been silent for two minutes.
29 tables were built on them, helmets, lamps, and names of miners to honor the monuments of the miners.
Also pictures and personal things like clothes and surf boards found their place here.
There were half-stressing flags on government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would again come out of the "hlubin land" to the surface, said to the participants of the memorial event the Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key.
"But they never came home."
He cannot say good-bye to his son until he saw his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mines.
A few foreign diplomats were involved in addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims.
During the November 19th explosion, British and South African miners were also involved.
Rescuers began to fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once toxic gases are dissolved, it will start cooling high temperatures inside the mine, telling the journalists police president Gary Knowles.
Hell, warriors!
Is the horror of art cinema suitable?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn tries to conquer the old border again with his battle epic "Walla Rising".
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he said, "Wallalla Rising"?
An engaged Viking fighter with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is freed from its torturers and in great killing almost supernatural with its opponents - it sounds ideal for young men who are looking for blood action, because our hero helps with cruel killing methods and their enemies eat even inwards from the belly when it has bad mood.
On the other hand, the One, as it is actually called, does not say a word throughout the film, and also the other characters will bear at most one or two sentences, or they will be pushed down to a tragic dying scream.
Otherwise, they remain silent and warm in the horridly beautiful hilly countryside of Scotland, which offers a stage of the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with interest in existism and very quiet camera shots.
It's good if the movie has more target groups, it's just a shame to rule out each other.
The director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy on drug dealers "Pusher", is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantin, but constantly defends itself to attract his works with either more humor of the main current or less brutality of art audience.
Most artists of the art cinema seem to be discouraged by shooting brains and insides everywhere.
The benefits of action films will be bored not later than when the One-eye leaves for freely explained reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries ships to Jerusalem and will be hanging up for eternity in disillusionment and fog until it seems that the manhood will reach America and remain silent there.
There is nothing to wonder, therefore, that in Germany "Wallalla Rising" did not get into the cinema and was now released only for DVD.
It's a shame mainly because of beautiful images, but also because of its distinctive façade, places to blood, it hides an exciting cinema that deserves a little attention.
In this film, it's not about dialogue or the exact story, it's all about the atmosphere, the hot dream that became a movie.
And it's not for the viewer to escape.
Refn does not give him a moment of release and slowly chokes him with cold shots and a cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all an indescribable hatred, which is said to be of the heartlike figure.
Only a little blond boy who helps the One-eyed leaves something like innocence, everyone else is driven by evil.
Of all the one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, which will become a time for enemies and temporary allies to the warrior of hell, perhaps an emissary of the devil.
It deforms destruction, but maybe only for the corrupt ones.
"Wallalla Rising" is a mysterious movie that can be hated and admired, for angering, excitement and admiration.
The experience.
Estimated ground work
The IAE Nuclear Energy Authority has a new warning of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is resisting expression - and it won't even allow control.
Around midnight from 5th to 6th September 2007 will attack at least four Israeli fighting aircraft F-15 I the mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of Euphrat; the nearest larger city is 30 kilometres away and it is called Diair as-Saur.
Its name appears in the documents of the International Nuclear Energy Authority (IAEA) when it is a reactor, which was allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in the valley that turns from the current.
On the basis of a communication from the US-American Foreign Secret Service of the CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearby village el-Kibar, would well throw on the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
Technology from the '50s is not a good thing.
The CIA presented a video with unshucked satellite images.
With computer animation, she explained which components of the reactor before destruction are expected to be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, photographs were still submitted which showed the building close to or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to have been shortly before the launch, but without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years of bombing, they don't know much more than that, even the puzzles got bigger over time.
The former US President George W. Bush recently published in his memory that the CIA was quite certain before the attack that Syria was building in an el-Kibar reactor, but essentially had no evidence of an "active nuclear weapon program" in the country.
Some of the CCIs in Europe are even more careful, and they only speak of a 'performent reactor', even if the CIA's presentation is 'reliable'.
They lack clear evidence, just like the IAAA.
When asking how sure the reactor is ahead, he answered the UN High Diplomacy in summer, IAE says that "a lack of material to raise questions".
While Syrzyany was quickly unloaded and properly matched the terrain, the drought was reportedly "unused military buildings".
Still, in June 2008 IAA was able to find the IAA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in the el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by humans.
In addition, the IAA received satellite photographs of commercial dealers from the time just after the attack, which should be more precise than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these aren't the market footage because it's exclusively bought by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
The IAE cannot therefore confirm their authenticity.
Syria always claimed she had never had a secret nuclear program, nor had she built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, says Damascus.
But that turned IAA away after the particle analysis.
Since then Damascus refuses to discuss things - as well as satellite shots.
In addition, he forbidd reinspectors from the second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of a bombed building.
But Israel also keeps silent.
"We will never comment on it", confirmed recently the official opinion of Prime Minister Ehud Olmertt.
The investigation of this case has gone so far as June 2008 and is "growing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the Office", as the High Western Diplomacy in the seat of IAA in Vienna - it is indeed a serious violation of the nuclear arms ban treaty that IAAA oversees.
IAA considers it a key to progress in the matter of another three devices to be "functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and unlike it, they still exist.
The revisions have not yet developed, or which equipment they are or what they have function or why they are suspicious.
According to information from the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, IAE is internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Massyaf and Iskandariayah, it is again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Issis) identified these objects and found on satellite scans a complex of buildings that is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Apparently, it is located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely because of this reason, it rejects Syria's approach to these three places.
In Vienna, it was said that the Sisters were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAE would have been sent out in advance by the United States to detect military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to US Secret Service facilities.
IAE has background and also satellite images that between these three places and the square of Euphratu transported material here and there.
In Vienna, the High Western diplomat said that at least one furnished should be "in connection with the production of fuel".
However, there is no "no evidence of sentimental activities", i.e. the enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where this uranium comes from and where it should be released later from plutonium on the bomb, there are only likely estimates on these central questions.
Also, it is not known whether the cares that could hide important traces are hidden in these three places.
It's like hundreds of trucks disappeared from the surface of the Earth, no one seems to have information about where the barrel came from.
Only a few kilometres away from el-Kibar and on the other side of Euphratu lying salt mine al-Tibni, which let Syria check as an appropriate warehouse for radioactive waste in 1998, considers IAE unlikely.
Former Inspector IAA Robert Kelley put him in connection with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, images from the universe show that after IAE demanded access, Syria performed in all suspicious places of work and removed large containers.
It may have been a coincidence, but it didn't help to clarify the suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles speak of the fact that IAE spent many months creating a plan for revisions that would allow Syria to keep any military secret - only the effort shows how much the interest of the auditors is.
In the meantime, Damascus refused this proposal.
If the Western diplomats in Vienna have yet to calm down a year ago that the reactor is destroyed, and that is why this thing has not been burning, the US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been speaking of a special inspection, which is one of the toughest means in which the Vienna nuclear office has to launch controls.
IAE Yukiya Amano, who would have had to suggest that he was already talking about the "powers that I would bow to in the future" but still hesitates.
This option poses a great risk: On one hand, most IAE Governors need to do so and many of the 35 countries that are represented are certainly not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything?"
Love in the Age of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working in summer for an still nameless real-life primary, there have been difficulties.
She wrote the script herself, it's the love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
They don't know much about it yet - but it also causes restlessness.
They are always saying that the woman who is Muslim will fall in love with her during the war in Yugoslavia in a Serbian man who raped her.
Bosen women’s associations protested immediately, so the planned film from Sarajevo moved quickly to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film has been made in Hungary and is in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Haseic from the Organisation of Women's War victims wrote through the UN-organization to assist refugees UNHCR Jolie and asked to meet her actress, now informed the Boston newspaper - Jolie is also the ambassador of the UN-organization to help refugees.
She's not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, which they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
In the camps where they raped, the love stories did not work and Jolie's attitude toward the victim reveals enough about the scenarios.
So her organization recommended the UN to assist refugees to release Jolie as Ambassador to inform Guardian.
What scenes did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosen Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, allowed smaller dams in Sarajevo to be made - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author emphasises that in his film there are no political intentions that she and her efforts have been devoted to the conflict in Yugoslavia that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give all the parties involved space.
In view of the contents, it remains vague.
On the Internet there is another version of the film that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the start of the war, and they meet again when she is like a bosen muslim introduced into a Serbian camp where he serves as guardians.
Which really sounds a lot different than "the victim of rape falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie really starts before the war is true.
Jolie argues that there is pressure on her that is not fair and is based on incorrect information.
Now they can free them from Hollywood: By publishing illegally on the Internet her script, as they have done many times.
Nothing but away
This evening is once again good for Iry.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates much over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans are happy to hear loud music, butt-ass feet.
Bailey-Pub in the South African Cork barks, because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and hit them.
"A beer pong" is called a bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning premium and to fly to Las Vegas for a world championship in a beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this scathing beer game and a horny computer computer, it doesn't go well together.
Yet, a 26-year-old man tries to have fun, react from lifeless questions about what the future will bring.
His plan is not playing passion in Las Vegas, going in January for an interview in New Zealand.
"I have a weird feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away and I haven't got a job yet."
Yet: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland - "at once she gained her dream job as Eventmanger, maybe it's a good sign," says a young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as an IT-radigator in London.
The boys leave: Just like Tanners, it looks like many families on the island.
100,000 Irish leave the country in due time, predicting the scientific institute for the economy and social affairs of the ESRI in Dublin.
They even count by 2015 with 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a fundamental loss.
If the predictions confirm themselves, there will be a similar immigration wave that Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
For decades, the rise that brought the Irish great well - being has been expanding again.
The economic crisis mainly finds young, educated Irish people, who have experienced only a rise.
The loss of employment and social retreat seemed to be absurd in these years.
The need was everyone, the money was too much.
In the meantime, there are three out of ten women and men up to 30 years without work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers complaining: "In Ireland everything goes downhill."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can, he goes away and our country loses his entire generation."
"The last one please turn off."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, the president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future black because the government says it only deceives and offers young people no prospects for the future.
"They reproduce minimum wages, but do not have a strategy to create new jobs", says 20-year-old.
He observes how her classmates are entrenched from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest worry is she'll have to move out in four years by herself.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see the topic positive.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbradExpo", an exhibition that offers a total service on a topic of work abroad.
"For beginners on the labour market there is an excellent opportunity for foreign workers to take first steps to the career ladder", says the manager.
On his website there are photographs of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: Working abroad are not galleys, but freedom and joy.
What it's like to build something else, he's known for six months, Seán O'Donovan.
Since a 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed together with 15 Irish colleagues at a construction site in Germany.
He's just building a fashion house at Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to go to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan will rarely get home because he works on extra shifts to pay his house loans.
"The situation is sometimes really a little crazy," he says, for the first time in a long time, the threshold of his own home is crossed.
"I make money in Germany to a house in Ireland that I'm not in at all."
He laughs in despair and walks in cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with preserved gardens, in the entrances parking big expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought a house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100% funded by loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions," he says.
He's worried that it might not work out well with the loan?
O'Donova's been thinking for a while, she's getting hot tea down, and she's like, "I don't have kids I've got to feed and I'm young; even though everything goes wrong, I can start over."
A construction engineer doesn't like saying things that he's so often heard.
"No one must starve - our situation is even a little dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"For a while, working abroad, it's not the worst thing that can happen-- maybe we just feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father, who left in the last economic crisis to England.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
To keep the future open and simply wait for life to grow elsewhere.
He's also had several years to work in London, and why shouldn't it be good in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend?
But there is one other thing that concerns him quite well these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she might go to a bachelorette party.
"No emotional feelings," he says, and he'll have a good beer.
"Bye, that sounds anxious."
"Let's call it a party of leaving, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Normal practice of democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing as well as the promotion of private business.
Criminal activity raises greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more powerful than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarómmetro survey, which took place in 18 countries and came exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in positions across the whole area.
This year's survey, which took place in September and early October, is dominated by two related issues.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
The promotion of democracy in several countries at the edge of Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has been on average 6% per year since 2002, the promotion of democracy from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year has increased.
She also grew up in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of the issues in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most human areas, are democratic beliefs, which attracts the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the whole area were satisfied with the fact that democracy works in practice in their country, this is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a large increase (Fig. 3).
In fact, 34% said that they trust a snowman in their country and 45% trust the government, once again it is the same numbers as last year, but it is a large difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, she undermined democracy in Latin America's economic crisis.
The aid was caused during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Besides, a stronger social security network helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin American people living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and decreased again to 32% in this year.)
But the nalad is changing in a wide range from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its acting President Luize Inacia Lula da Silva, is reflected in the widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where recession was more serious and the state of violent crime deteriorated.
Only the second time they began to carry out surveys, they see more respondents across Latin America as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Significantly 31% say that they either themselves or their close relatives have become victims of crime last year, but this is a decline compared to 38% of the previous year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
Massive economic performance is reflected in increasing private business and market support: around 71% of respondents across the whole area say that private business is necessary for development, this percentage increased from 56% of 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will enable their country to develop, this percentage increased from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuela's respondents have the same opinion (and 80% of them support private business), although their left-wing President Hugo Chávez owns many private companies.
Brazil is a leading country in the area, as mentioned in 19% of respondents (among 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, as opposed to last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States are considered to be the most important country of respondents in Mexico and in a large part of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Critified Options
No one expected that the general elections in Haiti would be perfect on 28 November.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to fear.
Elections meant filling urns and repeating votes, voting tickets spread across channels, broken electoral rooms and intimidation.
Election rooms open after hours late.
Many Haitians, including many who were moved because of the January earthquake, have roamed around and tried to find out where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including some anticipated predecessors, shouted that it was fraud and called after the elections were cancelled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread all over the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking UN official in Haiti, said that "in many respects, it was a pretty good election."
Observers from the Organisation of the American States and the Caribbean community have carefully said that "they do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily cancel the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority whose opposition votes are bound by René Préval, the non-popular leaving President and his candidate Jude Célestin, is to announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive fight is planned for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
The two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelle, rapper and Miranda Manigat, the former first lady, resigned from their original call for a vote to be declared invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or negligible support between voters, is to be identified by the electoral commission for achieving a decisive fight.
Because of the order epidemic of hell and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake were concerned that electoral participation would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of their disorganization they were prevented.
A total of 250 000 ID cards, which are necessary for the vote, remained undiluted shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of legitimate and popular governments as a major step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And then it is clear that the Haitians stand for it themselves.
On tops to center
In the weeks when suddenly she was widowed, Cristina Fernández, the Argentinian President, with public sympathy, when her popularity increased from 20 to 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Nevertheless, turning this success into a successful campaign for the second term of office in elections next year may depend on whether Mrs Fernández's mourning mourner gives up his late husband, predecessor and political partner Nestor Kirchner.
And all will be based on these signs.
Mr Kirchner, who continued economic policy even after his wife had successfully become president, had in the way of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This enabled the first few to spend additional income on the basis of libiency.
The Government of Mrs Fernández lost most of it in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized in the death of Mr. Kirchner for a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of Peronist’s ruling political movement joined Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (which led to the slap and blame of the government of corruption), Congress could not approve the 2011 budget.
"I will not swear," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now be paid for next year, while the president will have more space to spend on the libity.
The economy is overheating: this year is likely to grow up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about the figure that is near 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the office in 2003, when Argentina faced economic collapse, set the priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to act with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleared INDEC, a statistical agency that joined the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now ease this policy?
It called for negotiations between private enterprises and trade unions.
And her officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy has been supported by the growth of world prices for exports of Argentinian agricultural products.
But inflation broke the growth based on large devaluation in 2002.
That may be the reason Mrs Fernández is letting her know that he wants to restore the Argentinian financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government created an agreement with bond holders who previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Now, Madam President Fernández is facing an agreement with the creditors' governments, which are grouped in a Paris Club, which owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact should not in the supervision of the IMF, as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economic Affairs announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer-price index that would remind the introduction to INDEC cleaning.
It is not yet clear whether Mrs Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of his term of office when his husband is no longer at her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get support from the middle class, which is tired of kirchnerism.
At the time of the return of Argentinans from the summer vacation they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to break down the many views her husband held in politics.
Half Encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer connection to land.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the legitimate, elected mayors and councils of the city on 27 November in five urban districts, which can be considered a wider review of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma is the representative of the feelings that prevail on land and have a strong establishment in business relations, including a partial trade agreement, in the biggest comparison with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma went through rehearsal, but only close.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) ended the defeat of three out of five mayors, she could not win most votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is inclined by the greater independence of Taiwan, received nearly 50% of all votes against the 45% side of the KMT.
If this were the presidential election, the President would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the proportion of his votes has decreased by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was together with KMT in city councils.
The elections took place as a majority of Taiwanese elections, which included a loud electoral truck and a mass assembly with flags with separate girls.
Even part of it was a mandatory mystery attempt to assassinate.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of KMT, was agitated for KMT candidates in the prior election.
The man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien clean across his face, hurt him and killed a viewer.
It was not biologically intended whether the gunman intended to hurt Mr. Lien or to settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, Head of DPP, claims that the shooting affected elections, suspicions of DPPs and leads voters towards KMTs.
Perhaps China was the only great winner of the campaign.
It was remarkable how the question of land itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates were passionate about plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
The KMT thus tends to avoid the acquisitions of the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP has also abandoned anti-China attitudes.
It is a response to the fact and the awareness that China's trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. President Ma on his part confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most Taiwan.
Government in Beijing can be expected to continue commercial bribes, together with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending the negotiator to Taipeja to set up a summit on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
I'm sure he'd love to see political integration, too, but first things first.
It will be better to wait after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP side, in any case, has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was on the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on the basis of a corruption charge.
The President in 2000-08 was a rebel and advocate for a clear independence.
But under Mrs. Tsai, a new generation has developed, which is moderated and DPP works hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs Tsai was summoned as a DPP candidate to the President, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held the office under Mr Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai published plans for research institutes which serve as a contact point between DPP and China, provided that their conduct can take place without prior conditions.
Mrs Tsai reports to the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "faithful alternative" to Mr Ma's surprised approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this shift.
In his statement issued by his purpose, he expressed his view that DPP candidates could be better achieved if they insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run as president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, DPP will fight for a selection between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's evaluations were bad, despite the sudden economic growth rate; KMT's candidates didn't want to go to the campaign with him.
His indifference seems to be based, in particular, on unemployment and deepening the gap between the rich and the poor.
KMT's spokesperson says he'll reorganize his cabin as well as local offices.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan to establish friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens regard economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonia Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has passed."
Nominees for Grammy: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
At the request of the President, people have to notice the law.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer, whom President Obama chose to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is referred to as one of Grammy's surprise prizes this year with nominations in the category's best new artist.
Since Spalding was a celebrated character on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza", the nomination came a little late, but it is in line with Grammy rules, when the artist must not publish more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist."
Its 2010 ambitious album "Chamber Music Society" has certainly recorded a step forward and thanks to its carefree vocal style and hbity hands with elements of pop, funku and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success that Norah Jones recorded in 2003, the closest equivalent for voting in Grammy, who are looking for a similar jazz work in this category for recent years.
Other judges Grammy rightly appreciate the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the instrumental album category, exciting, refreshing album ride, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of the experienced saxophoneist James Moody "Moody 4B" and the John Beasley keyboard player "Positotly."
Trobonne Shorty, a Christian favorite from New Orleans, and a frequent guest on HBO "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society gained some well-deserved recognition in the category of large files, when it was the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still courageous Dave Holland, whose live album with the "Pathways" cult created a beautiful example of how bassist could have his free hand as a band.
Nominations Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
Nominees for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from all over the world at Grammy 53th annual prices.
The leading position in the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for the piano and orchestra, with a number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestra, with three points.
An Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No.4 "Los Angeles", a work that was ordered over Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted in Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance for awards.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories that include orchestral, opera, glee club and solo recordings.
The category for the producer of classical music of the year has five nominees, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nomination for the classic album was won by Bruckner and his Symphony No.3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughtery and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castroti" depicting various artists; and Verdi "Requiem" from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for the opera category, the nominations are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyric Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Family Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers who are nominated at Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a performance recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the Esa-Pekka Salonen tacti.
About 30 minutes of work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for an instrumental soloist with the orchestra.
A composer from L.A. said that he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for the mandoline interpreter Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble based in New York.
"I wrote it with the help of tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a phone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received nominations in the category for orchestral performance, following the lead of Chicago Symphony while recording Stravinski's work.
The instrumental soloists who received the nominations include Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal soloists, only women were represented this year, namely Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Meash Brueggergosman.
In the classic transition category she won the nomination of sopranoist Jessye Norman for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecule is approved by the Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecule has received unanimous support from the local planning commission for more than five hours of popular public witnessation.
The critics have attacked a project that promotes terrorism and will lead to the suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in line with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of that as an American citizen."
"It means justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" he added.
"They who are against it only shout loudly."
"We have really good people in our valley."
The negotiations began at six o’clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time they took discussions with people who were for or against the centre. These voices were equally divided, publishes Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the news website.
"There is no America," one comment appeared.
"We're the Planet of the Monkey with the Socha of Liberty fell into the sand."
"Americans have fallen."
The planned Islamic Centre has provoked protests in other parts of the country, including the vicinity of Ground Zero, a tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley Im Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community of some 135 families had been living in Riverside County for years without an incident, but wanted more and more suitable space than the warehouse space that he rented together with the manufacturer of filtering systems.
The new mosque with dimensions of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minerals and will grow up to a height of 43 feet.
It should take a space of 4.32 acres in Nicolas Road, about three kilometres east of Chaparal High School.
The Opponents can still appeal to the City Council about the project.
Disease resistance microbes increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
Discover strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands space for finding new forms of life on Earth and maybe even further.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have been considered and fundamental so far.
"This organism has dual capacity."
"Can grow either because of phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very special, but it is not evidence that this is a form of really 'mimosian' life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared on Thursday on the online edition of Science magazine.
It was long considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
Scientists, however, found that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake in California are able to continue to grow after the arsenic replaces phosphorus.
"It will begin to amaze you what is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This find is important for finding life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life can look, said Anbar.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the news report published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, sparked broad speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "it shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that the set of elements that we regard as 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another element in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, which conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of arsenic.
Arzen and phosphorus are chemically similar elements, thus considering that the microb, which is exposed to both elements, can be able to replace one as another.
"Arzen is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can hardly separate these elements."
"The arsenic is so different that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus. When it gets into the organism, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GfaJ-1 and exhibit them with an increasing concentration of arsenic that are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes are growing better with phosphorus, but since they can also survive with a replacement arsenic, the possibility of a form of life that uses arsenic can appear naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or months where the arsenal is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a specialist microbiology assistant at the University of Florida, stated that the idea of an arsenic that could be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but never found an example on which this fact would prove.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could be used by former life forms.
"This suggests that there could be other ways to create life, not just the way it was created during the early period of the Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon Research Team.
The research was supported by NASA, Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower Motel were found.
Four show dogs - two Akitas and the big Pembroke Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 Motel, the authorities communicated.
Two dogs were discovered in the middle of the afternoon and two remaining dogs then Wednesday late evening, said Steve Whitmore, spokesperson of a police department for the Los Angeles area.
"Good news is dogs are okay," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were transferred to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found in what locality, and so he did not share detailed information regarding their finding.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
Dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek were not caught to comment on the case.
They were very happy when two Akitas were found at the shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's representatives found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, three-year-old dog Trace and 10-month-old female Didi, were without injury, communicated by the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard breed and Peek, who had planned to participate in regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unloaded until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions, planned in days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, said Peek daily The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is only one stop at almost monthly steam travel after dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard signed up at the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their cars in front of the window of the room.
They also took three dogs - a puppy boxer, Parson Russell a terrier and a British ohor - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in a car where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened the windows a little bit so that dogs have enough fresh air in their car.
Peek and Rickard reported a car theft at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to a missing dog, and dogs would implant microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was not clear whether they would be awarded prices.
The lion is once again ready to scream now that the restructuring of MGM is finally approved by the court.
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM finally received a green light so that it could start over again.
On Thursday, Federal Insolvency Judge New York officially blessed the "priorly packaged" creditor plan to settle about $5 billion of debt and clear the way for 86 years old entertainment company, focusing on film production and television shows.
Fourthly, the plan meets the requirements of the US insolvency order does not remain MGM any legal obstacles to relaunching the founders of Spyglas Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the leading leaders of the high school.
The number of employees is about 320 of the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until the JPMorgan Chase fails to reach the planned financial resources allowing a loan of $500 million to finance new operations and the production of MGM.
Now it's a connection to an investment bank that needs $75 million on its own, and funding is expected around half of December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management of how to solve its finances, as management fought to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
On that August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron, and an expert on turnover, known for Krispy Kreme Dougnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 college creditors took much longer than expected.
After a few months, the parties agreed to sell the company at the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several interested parties, none of them was willing to pay $2 billion of US dollars plus the finances that the creditors demanded.
In spring this year, everything was back on the rice board and the MGM team started working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditor at the end of October.
In the coming weeks, when MGM officially rises from bankruptcy, Moelis and Cooper will receive many million dollars bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $1.5 million.
Cooper's companies that collect for their services, which run the company, $375 000 a month, will receive a reward for success, the so-called "successsee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to restore production in MG, which issued only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will come out in early 2012.
They are also planning to contribute to the financing of two films, the pretext of which will be the book "Hobit" together with Warner Bros.
Studio needs to settle a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of the two films that Peter Jackson will direct.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM debts, was looking for the possibility of combining studies with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technology toys that keep your budget for presents in balance
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing toy of the iPad, followed by the video game system. However, in both cases it is a significant intervention in the gift budget.
Consider that you can buy five BMX rounds for $99 at the price of one iPad and one Kinect game costs just like 10 beads screws or about 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your budget for presents in balance.
I recently visited three national toy vendor - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law works; this year's technological toys have much more energy, at the same prices, if not something lower, compared to last years.
While relatively fewer new toys appeared with associated websites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offering more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increased as well as battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All these prices are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases which are otherwise marked.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, from 3 years old) are stuffed animals who sing when you press their belly.
On one press, the animal sets out the tone, and the second print starts to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you twirl, you can't stop.
Best choice in combination of singing and dance is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Pice, 60$, from 2 years)
Last year, I borrowed 14 inch animatic doll on Elmo Live Technology, which can play Simon Says and is also able to walk a month thanks to its innovative slipper leg with wheel blocking.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor's toy, although their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, maybe you remember Alfie, one of the first computer learning toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, 40$, for children from 3 years old), with a backpack full of flower cards, which are designed to turn the car into fun with self-employed, funny work session.
If you're following a smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest option with simple use, with qverts keyboard, although games do not have the most effective teaching as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change in Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Preice (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has a slot on the SD card that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children from 8 years of age) is a set of five cubes that are no larger than the matchbox, each has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing cubes in a row before the time runs out; it is great for the competition in the improvized formation of words.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest extent, two toys of Webkinz and Club Penguin were represented in the toys.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years), which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate online code, your child will receive enough credits at Club Penguin store to any two items.
This could include roller skates or Puffle pet.
A little bit larger than the brush of your tooth brush is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years old), the latest from a series of microrobots on the button battery.
The bug moves fast to 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's funny if you make a maze of dice and see if he can find a way out.
He's also very resistant.
Our guy was able to fall down from the kitchen table and spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
Setting up gentler police controls in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked across the square, carefully controlled his orders and gave orders half-o-o-o-o-o-o with military authority.
He wanted women's members - Chinese brave urban order enforcers, served and rejected for their hard work and admiration in violence - to give some impression on the voice of those around them.
Stand straight!
Hurry up!
Show them, whispering quietly, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood in sight.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted as ruler.
Four headgears perfectly sit on hair that are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"I think they look average," said Mr. Tang.
"Models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered new goalkeepers to have higher education.
Province Guangdong has changed gray-green uniforms on allegedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in central China replaced the tight-armed views: in 2009, 50 officers were reported to have been staggering with snacks and looking carefully at the owners, after half an hour, the seller packed up and left.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 residents in Chengdu for the main picture chosen to be an operation.
Since 2003, he completed his city police for 13 women, specifically selected according to his appearance, proportionality and young age.
The aim is to show besides the gross side of the police also the softer, the female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson alone would be in trouble to get into secret Chinese city groups.
They would argue critics for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce the city order, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But China's media usually capture different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the Hubei province broke down an uninvolved viewer to death after he used his cell phone to film how they began in the event of a protest against the dump.
Last year the training of policemen in Beijing took place, the manual to this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual was, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrators without signs of blood.
This year, an oblivious melon dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five policemen and suffered a left brain injury.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded on the Internet shows Chinese cops, as they attack street vendors.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, national edition, she cried last year after another discussion on tactics.
The paper said, "reasonably thoroughly cleansing."
The skeptics say that such access is not enough.
After the period was advertised in October, interested in eight new female policemen, The Beijing Evening News was concerned with whether women had real responsibilities or were merely a distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The period required female candidates from 18 to 22 years with a good figure and "five features of the face in the right proportion."
Adepts should be higher than the average, i.e. higher than 1,6 metres.
Services at age 26 are compulsory.
The shareholders claim that work is mentally too demanding for women over 25 years.
"Jeji image is an important thing," said one unnamed cop at Rednet.com, as if a government website.
"The Canadians must first prove the external quality which they then determine others belong to their height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the number of characters and "interior quality".
Women are like flower vases, he said, and he added, "In order for them to be vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of District City Administration, does not agree with this description.
But he pointed out that the height requirements in China are also common for other jobs, both sexes.
As well as a requirement for proportionate features of the face.
Which means that the question of good attitude is discussed between the Chinese.
Surely the disability or mutilation will not apply.
"It cannot allow a lame person to serve with us," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who holds watch at Baoguang Square near the monastery, has 22 years of age, faces like an apple and gently shaped mouth.
She doesn't think she could have a sexual appearance, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic view.
Her coworker with lairs, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our job is to represent the picture of the city."
They do not object to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than merely to involve traders in streets where they can carry out their activities.
Every morning, a group stands against more than ten marketers, who run on foot or bikes and try to sell as many dumplings and bowl of tofus as possible before they are banished.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu, when the marketplacer started running, and he left his bike with noodles for a while.
Police are describing their responsibilities as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day is basically about the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, studying in his free marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have powers as their male counterparts to entertain goods sellers.
They can only threaten to report the facts to their male leaders.
The tendency then is to protect them from sudden public manifestations of hostility against official apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rebelled after false rumors were spread over the fact that police officers killed a salesman.
More than ten police officers or police officers have been injured in the night hours; 14 government vehicles have been reversed or burned.
So far, Xindu has escaped such violence.
But peace can only be guaranteed hardly.
Only two blocks from the quiet square of Baoguang, where there were patrol officers that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the corner of the street.
The police confiscated a motorcycle that was fixed in the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by the regulations.
The bike owner could've cried as much as he wanted.
A 15-minute walk from the cops facing anger, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to a male group, stayed in the back, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 years of age who already have only a helpful role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintenance and cooling image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li.
"It's all the public that starts with it."
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign.
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign from the criminal charge that involved his affair with the former campaign advisor and his efforts to provide lobby, reported at the center of the senator's attorney.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, the Nevada Republican, faced and was considered, until scandal, as a possible Republican candidate for the president for 2012. His affair got into national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said that he was a decision that followed almost after a year's investigation, "a certain pleased".
The senator could still face the disciplinary action of the Senate's ethical committee.
Mr Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "we have informed that Senator Ensign will no longer be the object of the investigation and that there is no further accusations against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
The talks, e-mails and other documents published in New York Times in October 2009 said that Mr Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lenient lobby that would lead to the silence of Mr Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a cashier in the Ensign campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after they employed Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, so many documentaries and interviews.
As Hampton was recently an assistant of Mr Ensign, he was excluded from the law of lobbying his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethical experts claim that Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were in front of the affair, have appeared contrary to the lobbying ban.
From the evidence that was published, "it was revealed that it was a clear case of preparation of the infringement," said Stanley Brand, a Welsh lawyer specialising in defending clients who are being investigated by the government.
While officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision on Senator Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethnic lawyers have said that the Ministry is cautious about the political lawsuit, after a large number of failures, including the decision of last year to suspend the action against former Senator Ted Stevens in the middle of the charge of questioning the state representation.
Federal prosecutors "requiredly hidden weapons", said Melanie Sloan, CEO of the Civil Responsibility and Ethics Organization in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a law firm who filed several complaints against Mr Ensign in the case.
"It shows essentially that the law does not apply to high-level government officials," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr Ensign's chief attorney, told him in the interview that on Monday he was called by the state attorney of the Ministry of Justice and then on the second day, and then told him that the ministry had found no charges against his client.
Mr Ensign's defense team cooperates with the prosecutors in an attempt to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in the Middle Declaration, "need to comply with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he gave to the state representatives.
"It is not pleasant to say the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to put an end to the investigation of a single complaint, in which the ethical group made accusations that the payment of the parents of Ensign Hampton had been violated by a federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said that she had insufficient evidence to prove that money was nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find lobbyist work was NV Energy, a major Nevadan company that supported the senator for a long time.
One email from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began to act as a lobbyist in society, the head of staff of Mr. Ensign - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had "bulled" to the Ministry of Interior about the discussed subject.
Mr Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another bad client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hired Mr. Hampton to do lobby work.
When the report on the affair first appeared last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned to his function as the fourth Republican Head of the Senate.
After many months of stagnance, Mr Ensign, two weeks ago, told reporters that he was planning to participate in a third term in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer the object of investigating the crime of his spokesperson Jennifer Cooper stated that the senator hopes that the ethical commission will be followed quickly by the Ministry of Justice and will end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the people of Nevada," she said.
The invitation to the village of Cheshire turns on Twitter
Half a dozen of them have written in the ranks of the courtroom.
One minute later, they sent news of a terrible testimony over Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter reports were dealt with by rape and child bonding to beds in a house that was burnt down.
On Thursday, the trial took place between Steven J. Hayes, who was sentenced to the killing of three Cheshire citizens, Connecticut, the family, and was to be officially ended with the imposition of the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed appeals with applications and arguments that probably employ the court for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the extended use of Twitter's main reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this extended immediate penetration of information with alarming details then introduced a jury when deciding to influence public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to consider whether the arrival of new technologies would also require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have seen in this trial, I believe there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Chief Defense Officer, Mr. Hayes.
The Judge of the Jon C process, Blue of the Supreme Court of State, briefly rejected claims regarding last week's return and the fact that the media were "quietly controlled" and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have recognised that reporting of well-known cases can raise questions about the justice of the process.
In the 1966 U.S. Supreme Court of the United States cancelled the sentence of Cleveland Chiropraktika, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, it was a "carneval atmosphere" in the process of media.
Some believe that this crime was an inspiration of the TV show and the movie "Leader".
Some lawyers said that the appeals that examined Hayes' ruling half a century later could be surprised by the argument that new rules could be needed to determine how to communicate from the courtrooms, which was unimaginable in Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media" in highly monitored cases, said John J. Donovan III, Professor Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said he was doing whatever.
Professor Donovan stated that some judges might be interested in the idea that restrictions on direct communication from the courtrooms can take a fairer process.
The Twitter case is only one of Mr. Hayes's many attorneys who would be able to argue for years to abstain.
For example, the defenders also claim that in Mr. Hayes' case, it may be prejudiced when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential judges by showing them a criminal photo of adversity when selecting a jury.
Some of the judges said that they were shocked by photographs of the victim that Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The defenders argue that they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed the jury, who was critical of the state's representatives, and that he wrongly imposed greater pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think on the weekend.
The judges weren't separated.
But their arguments about the influence of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They took the opposition against the verdict last month that the case was dominated by reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for the governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media were constantly snoring the flames of emotions in this case.
"The daily appeal of the media, the cameras and reporters in court," wrote the lawyer, "there was something that hasn't been seen yet in New Haven, and maybe it's also a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the talks, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more devastating than the reports stated later and from their point of view, the police should manage the scope of other processes.
But some lawyers called for appeals with often used arguments that social and technological changes require adjustments to the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision in the case of Dr. Sheppard's judgment, because of the widespread operation of the trial and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "presiding the Sheppard versus Maxwell in the 21st century."
Can courtesy overcome the gap?
After a campaign that was remarkable of its insult and negativism, this week, a small amount of courtesy appeared in Washington.
Is this the first flag real cooperation between two political parties or just an illusional moment before the rapid return to party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's negotiations with President Obama and Parliament's leaders have not brought any major discoveries on the fundamental issues that must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, it was a courteous discussion of the differences between the two parties, as well as the definition of their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of the party's society.
The mid-term public meeting of the President's deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences remaining among the members.
It seems clear that close synergies for a few months have built mutual respect that exceeds the ideological gap that the members continue to divide.
And it's kind of hard to say that she started a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in the test period - they examine each other's signs of collegiality and compromise, trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience against the renewed party war.
Therefore, on Tuesday and later evaluation of the participants were carried out with a minimum of requirements or accusations.
Philosophic differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the ratios that have prevailed here for the last two years.
Whether this is a matter of taxes, expenditures, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections prepared Washington at least quickly.
"No question whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They're inevitable after the election.
The election was extinguished by the strenuous emotions, and then they got quiet.
It's okay."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have a little chance to find solutions.
The Bush tax reduction expired at the end of the year, and no one considers it beneficial.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, as a likely compromise on unemployment benefits, only because Republicans cannot see how they support the reduction in property taxes, while the unemployed reject unemployment aid.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimistic about the possible agreement on these issues is already seen, together with the ratification of the new start-up contract.
But William Galston of Brookings Institute points out that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship between two political parties when the 112th Congress calls for January.
More likely, there is a period of inconsistencies, or even inevitable, he said.
"After the things must be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in a short perspective," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely extended - to the fact that courtesy will lead them to genuine cooperation.
"I look at all the events between today and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the compilation of the new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of tea parties who helped create it.
Republican leaders now stand before the danger of high-leveling, know that they have to act according to their promises and have to reduce government expenditure and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These incentive lines are clear in the initial response to the deficit recommendations that include reform of the tax law and an increase in certain taxes, an increase in pension age and a reduction in expenditure.
The joint presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles took the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and they have, in their opinion, to put pressure on the deficit question to a public program of ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in a 18-member commission so that they can present their plan as official recommendations and thus fight to get as close as possible to this number.
The greatest resistance is among elected officials in the jury who suggest that we have at least today, small foundations or will for compromise in the case of financial matters.
Galston predicts two stages in battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans invite Obama to solve the budget, taxation and healthcare, when the period of greater party cooperation will follow.
What's the next move?
Public opinion.
There is much evidence that, despite the partiality of the last elections, most Americans want to continue to see two parties working together.
If it could be pointed to the heel, like it was in 1995, then both parties would closely monitor the public response.
Whoever's going to be threatening to lower their votes, they're probably going to change course, and they're going to look for compromise.
That could be an optimistic view of the thing.
Stranicist and directionalism are now bigger than they were in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there was a greater ideological gap between Obama and Parliamentary Republicans than it was in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a foreplay for more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, courtesy that appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will cost many efforts on both sides to find common foundations on issues that keep dividing them.
An outraged American document says Moscow as a refuge in corruption
The city's control is in the hands of "Pektokracie" and it continues with parts of bribes and bribes for protection that come on the way to Kremlin, released the American embassy in Russia in February.
Police and Federal Security are largely holding protective wings, helping to explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal business but also from organised crime groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical office" - will marry her when the money starts moving up the ladder.
The entry sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Wednesday through the WikiLeaks on their website.
The record shall be based on sources whose names have been rediated.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accused of high corruption.
He was dismissed in October by Dmitry Medvezev, but since then we can only monitor minimal changes in purgatory.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent design company, have constantly denied corruption for many years and has won several charges for perjury for such accusations.
In September, he said to the Russian television station when he was asked for the proven testimony of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's crap."
The Russians are absolutely convinced that if their company is corrupt, it will prove to be a vote.
It is unusual, however, to meet such details spoken in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of that they would make diplomats of foreign countries.
"The government of Moscow and its connection to crime have led some to call it 'dysfunction' and to confirm that the government works more as a kleptokrat than as a government," says the report.
The "criminal elements are pleased with the so-called 'criminate' (the term of the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'mach' or protection') provided to them by the police, Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior and the State Attorney's Office, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of Moscow.
"The analytics identified and three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is on the very top."
"Federal Security Services, Ministry of Interior and Missions are on second level."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"This is an inefficient system in which crime groups fill empty places in some areas, as the city does not provide certain services."
The report says that the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies, and the police are focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, "the shopowners in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from FSB or the Ministry of Interior (right than organized crime groups) because they have no only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
"For this reason, there is no more protection from criminal gangs."
The record says that while choosing money is complex, protection itself may already be in trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who don't pay fast enough, their trades are closed under different pretenses.
He spoke several times about fighting corruption, but admitted that he had made only little progress.
The Ambassador's report speaks of men taking bags, probably handcuffed cash, to Kremlin himself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvezev must rely on bureaucrats," said George Satarov, director of Moscow's research team, in the recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He's not part of the political class because there are no more political classes in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without power distribution, corruption is inevitable, he said.
In India, it estimates that Russia’s corruption costs over $300 billion annually.
The country ranks at 154th place in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by non-governmental organisations Transparency International (the land is divided from at least the most corrupt).
The revelation of the report of the American embassy, which appeared in Moscow only in late evening, certainly did not provoke enthusiasm in the Russian government, although only to the extent that in Moscow shortcomings could be accused of Luzhkov, it may be for Kremlin the possibility to argue in the matter of solving the problem.
In an interview for CNN and Larry King, Putin said that the documents that WikiLeaks had published could have been counterfeits and responded angryly to the statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvevo Robin.
"The truth about the whole matter is that it is our mutual interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethical."
The Red Khomér veterans are forced to deal with the past.
The director of the Anlong Veng High School of Men who built it, the leader of the Red Khmers Ta Mok.
"All of them love the Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "circumcision" for his sovereignty during the government of Red Khmers, the commander in this remote holding of the Red Khmers in northwest Cambodia remains popular where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers of this organization are still living.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers gave up government, it is also destroyed by long-lasting loyalty in Anlong Veng.
In April, the victims at the forum of truth and reconciliation were allowed to publicly confront the people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers.
And in July to bring together the UN and Cambodia's first conviction of the former member of the Red Khmers, the judgment of a local leader, the theoretically known violent society of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With all such progress, there was an increase in restlessness between the Red Khmer vets in Anlong Veng, which complicates efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to re-enter into Cambodian society.
"The former Red Khmers are a grudge and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chang Youk, Head of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life between Red Khmers was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Red Government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, the estimated 1.7 million people were executed or starved, sick or reworked.
When the Vietnamese attacked and thrown the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remainders of the regime and his soldiers fled to Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they began the rebellion, which lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary ran a party war from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while the Mok cultured supporters in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement, sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. The large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to switch to the government, which culminated with the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who endured, was captured by government forces in the nearby Yangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for trial.
Their patrons did not seek them, most of the former Red Khmer warriors have fallen into the ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of movement.
Although several elite Red Khmers maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people had only minimal advantage from the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Justice and Reclamation Centre, which runs the public forum all over Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by utopic agri ideologie regime."
"They've been an education without any idea of doing business."
Sorry Lim, 55, who entered the Red Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before he settled down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmer was good," he said.
"That Mok's been eating everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to make everything for ourselves."
The ongoing court of Red Khmers raised concerns as well.
At the beginning of next year, the court will investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of Red Khmers.
The Court of First Instance has a mandate to prosecute the leading redundancies and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been told whether to continue in the four cases at issue as well.
It was little to calm the fears of Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Red Government at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007 she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she had watched over the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers were probably killed.
A recent steam night, Im Chaem returned from her field work to her wooden house on a dirty trip outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and the shadows appeared through dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past between the Red Khmers.
If the court had brought her up, she would have refused to go.
"In Cambodia, peace rules and is stable," she said.
"If more prosecutions appear, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ran from the Red Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought out other suspects, although experts and historians disagreed.
"Kambodja must dig up a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chang Youk from the documentation center.
"Measuring in a Khmer affair means blinding broken pieces," he said.
"It's our duty to put these broken pieces together so we can understand each other."
The Centre has a first textbook approved by the Government on Red Khmers, with 75 pages and the title "The History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Red Khmers.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Vengu knew only a few details about Red Khmers, despite the connection of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng said that a new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he took his book home to study.
"My family refuses many parts of the textbook and judgments," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be tried."
Such resistance makes reconciliation more complex and more difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forum, the textbook, and the court are beginning to influence, he has spoken further.
Red Khmers still have a strong spell here.
Up in the mountains of Dangrek Mountains, the road is covered with a weed and sanded with dumped plastic bags, which leads to a rectangular of black seed covered with rusty metal roof.
The body Pol Pota was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, mobile salesman on the edge of the road said she doesn't know much about the man who was cremated in that place.
"He has a strong spirit, many locals walk here and prays to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday, and she was planning to visit Pol Pota's resting place, where she would bring the union of mature bananas in hope that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees that it appears to be its supply of weapons based on uranium.
In the surprising victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material all over the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they would surrender their supply of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint declaration, issued after the Security Summit of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Serge Martynov.
For years, the U.S. government has been trying to convince Belarus to give up a highly enriched uranium and it seems that the last spring was hit by an accident stone.
But American officials have told The Washington Post that in the last two months, several undercover operations have been conducted with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons based on uranium from the Belarusian research facility.
This has prepared the land for the Middle Agreement to remove the rest of the material - approximately 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke on a condition of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of Obama's most important results of the 47th National Nuclear Safety Summit in April in which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was probably a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was truly fascinated by the fact that they wanted to place on the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves that the process works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Partnership for Global Security, Group supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a major, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, that he would secure all the sensitive nuclear materials throughout the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of all their supplies of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have thus done so at the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up his uranium.
"We have a highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko.
"It's our commodity... we don't choose to make dirty bombs and we're not gonna sell it to anyone."
"We use it only for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus has joined the United States a few months ago and has shown interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove the Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated, because the material was easily tanned, announced by officials.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled over 1 300 miles into a Russian storage and liquidation facility, said the officials.
The second operation was closed on Monday and carried out by air, said the officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of it in the supply of the Belarusian Research Institute, a less enriched uranium, which is not an accident for nuclear weapons production.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust", which led to an agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Beniewski, official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Three Redction.
This year, James Martin Center for the Non-Proliferation Study estimated that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium used for weapons production.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration, seek to remove its resources by 2012.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been tense for years, mainly due to the severe repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statements indicate a possibility of gradual landing.
"We have made progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that a more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving relations and this is essential for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government has not done precious CIA flights
The Spanish government did not make expensive contributions to CIA flights transporting trapped Taliban and members of Al-Qaida to Guantanam through the Spanish Territory, as expressed in its telegram by the United States Envoy in Madrid.
This follows from the documents provided by the Wikileaks daily El País, where it also states that the then first Deputy Prime Minister, María Teresa Fernándezová de la Vega, asked for the Spanish exekutiva to be informed and "to show that it has proper supervision of foreign air carriers flying through the Spanish airspace".
A meeting between Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega took place in June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe, in which it was charged with dozens of states, including Spain, together with human rights violations.
The Prime Minister said that the Communication from the Council of Europe "was taken by Zapater's Government from the Game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide on this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no problem with flights of classified services across its territory.
"They simply want to be informed just so that they're not "prepared", reports Aguirre in one of the documents.
Also, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel Moratinos indicated to the American ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter as low as possible as possible, but by having this matter in the hands of the judges, he had limited possibilities of influence".
in February 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González informed the embassy that, as far as it concerns it, he did not intend to block the initiative of the Judges to request the removal of documents from the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminate file or sensitive information", explained the embassy after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concerns about the "recognitional coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the exchange of information between CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to address this case discreetly among governments", regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of lunch, the US Ambassador and Home Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby said that "the Spanish Judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they would consider appropriate", said the instructions to his co-workers, "although the comments will be banished with the intention of reducing tension".
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the political side of the popular Party (PP; Czech People's Party - reads.) on this issue.
" Despite her general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Party of the Popular Party will not hesitate to use any indication that the Zapater government has tolerated or intentionally ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even if this revelation could have negative consequences for the Government of the United States", notes.
A pregnant mother complained on her mother's network of "worship"
A young woman talked about a child when she was already dead, and she had her blog: "Teror in galicia"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández on the Internet says "Muki".
With this nickname, which she has been using since she has been using, she has communicated with her cousin and at least once a friend; both of them are from Noia village in La Coruňa, from which a young woman comes.
The 2008 news.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman's emotional life, which the daily ABC rebuilds with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30 - year - old woman from Galicia entered a relationship with the industrialist Iván Túnez in 1998.
They were together for one year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
A man wanted to know if his newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never let her run DNA tests.
She's found a new acquaintance soon enough.
Her chosen man was Alberto, a young man from near Lousam.
Their relationship took a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When a girl went to Balearian islands to look for a job, the little one stayed with her partner who even came to Palma for a week.
However, from the content of her communication, it is apparent that the relationship has fallen apart.
In March 2008, she's alone in Menorca, and she says, "Alberto's some angry that I went to work."
"When I told him it seemed good to him, he now realizes that he must be with the little one all day and can't do what he wants."
Then she's talking about the text message she just got, "I want you to come back this month or give me the address I need to send you a baby."
He's complaining, "If he doesn't like me leaving the little one with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
in May he talks about his return to my place: "I'm going to go this week, but I'm just going to stay till 19th, because 20th, I have to go to work to make sure I don't get to this place."
He explains that if everything goes well, he'll take his son together.
"He will be with whom he is to be with, so with me, and he will never happen again in my life that I would leave him with someone other than my mother", a questionable purpose in view of her bad relationship.
There's another post in July.
When he lashes this report, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island of the first day of this month is expected to be murdered 10th, is already dead.
"César is happy on one side, but she's not on the other side."
"On the one hand, he's with me, and he likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes almost every day to school."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"She's going to be going to summer school, and I'm going to save some money for the nanny."
Seventeen greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar who asks me when to come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos on the e-mail, look how he wants to meet me, I need sex."
Three more reports: "The boy is well, goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one news about the Computer, the current partner, "He's giving me money."
On the internet, the Mónines' contributions to the algae are devoted to anime and manze.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she used to call herself "The Muki Ex-Watchman".
"Teror in Galicia (motto)".
The last man with whom she lived, a guardian, expresses her regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the Palma Province, where she arrived from the detention center in Menorca yesterday.
A lawyer, Carlos Maceda, said that the defendant does not remember how everything happened and that she had no intention of hurting the little one.
But before that, she admitted that she drowned Caesar in the bathtub and put his body in the trunk.
The defense and the prosecutors are asking for psychiatric examinations.
The People would have won 4 chairs in the House and the PCC (the Socialist Party of Catalania - readly, the curse) would have lost 9 mandates.
with results from November 28th, the PP party could have a major word at the Councillors in Lérida, Tarragon and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes gained and the number of experienced Members during recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalania - noted.) has already given an idea of general elections, whether or not there will be an increase, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in all-national elections is usually the same as the Catalan elections.
In 2008, Catalan people received 610.473 votes in general elections, while this number was only 316.222 in the 2006 autonomous elections.
Last Sunday, the PCC (People's side) received 384.091 votes.
If this tendency to increase, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PCC and the loyalty of the PP voters, analysts of this party calculated that if the elections were held general, the PCC could obtain 12 Members in the House compared to the current 8, the CiU party (Convergencia i Unio, Czech Cod and Union - read. 4 mandates (now they have 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 chairs (now has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catain has a major significance for PP and PSOE (Spain Socialist Workers Party).
According to this analysis of humankind, the website of the ERC (Levice Republican Party of Catalania) would have lost one member - now it has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia - readn.) would have one more mandate.
However, according to the election calendar, the nearest delivery will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the socialist domination in four major province cities and also on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administration with the largest envisaged budget - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and humanists agree with the possibility that the PCC could lose its city hall in Barcelona, Tarragon, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive most and could not contact their traditional allies, the ERC and the ICV.
In view of the debate of the Republicans, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in Barcelona's representative - since at least 5% of the votes have to be obtained.
The PP side has increased the number of votes received in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists believe they can play the main role in the Tarragon turn, where they ruled together the PP party before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP received only 500 votes more than the PCC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The people have also won other important town halls such as Badalona, Casteldeels or Reus.
At present, the PP has a representation at 34 Councillors in Catalonia and would like to create candidates for as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell provided the organization Al-Qaida thousands of passports
In addition to the seven detained in Barcelona, the other three were detained in Thailand.
Seven Pakistani and one Nigerian, who were arrested by agents of the General Information Commissioner in Barcelona, formed a jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, which established passports to different groups of Al-Qaida organisations, among which also "Tygs of the liberation of Tamil Ílam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", while the second appointed group was the author of the assassinations in Mumbai, in which 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter; it aims to ensure that the operation of Kampai by weakening the counterfeiting apparatus of Al-Qaida at international level and "limiting its operational capabilities".
The investigators estimate that this cell could have been active in Catalonia in two years, sending thousands of travel passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then delivered to groups that form a criminal galaxy of Al-Qaida organisations, so that their "bodiers" could travel safely across the borders of Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active cell that had a jihad network in Europe, and therefore other European police units participated in such investigations in addition to Thai services, and it cannot therefore be excluded that there will not be similar interference in other European countries in the following days, such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiquur Rehman, Jabra Asghar, Malik Iftichar Ahmad, Mohammed Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigeria Babatunde Agunbiade) developed another in Thailand where the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Siriculaya Kijbumrung were captured.
They were those men who drove from Bangkok a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan Network, whose part was disposed of in 2009, stole especially tourist passports that met the requirements of Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men aged 25 to 45, have had to be valid for several years and have been without visas.
The investigation documents stress that there are no facts known so far that would link the detained acts from Catalonia with the bombing in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then faked in Thailand.
However, it is worth mentioning that a few days before this attack, some thousands of dollars were sent from the Catalan Transfer Agency to purchase cards into mobile phones, which later were used members of the "comanda" that killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
People’s Party (PP) requires Mas to stop the fiscal agreement
The Presidency of the PCC Party (Lid Party of Catalana) Alicia Sánchezová-Camachová had the opportunity to present himself to Artur Masu, under which he is willing to support his introduction into the function of President Generalitt; these conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and to reject a risky agreement such as the economic agreement the leader of the nationalists wishes to propose during their mandate.
The President of the Catalan People met with Artur Mas with a certainty of 18 parliamentary chairs received in elections last Sunday, which is more than satisfactory for the acquisition of the obscene, and the CIU candidate needs at least one of the formations forming opposition to abstain from voting on its deployment to the Office.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on future alliances that the nationalists in the House would like to maintain when general elections are held, but, so far, the talks that Mass is conducting these days with the rest of political leaders are held in the Catalan spirit.
As for President PP to receive its support for putting it into office, "he will have to put an end to all sovereign and free speeches", as well as the economic agreement - similar to the one from Basque - the leader of the CIU even wanted to vote in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to defy the outraged political apparatus of autonomous governance and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Masov's inclusion will be dealt with within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC) who promised hard opposition, Joan Herrerou (ICV) and is now meeting Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Riverou (Ciutadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidaritat Catalana).
The head of the geriatric facility shall ensure that there has been no death as a result of "a lack of action"
The presentation of the Olot Centre does not rule out that their care provider killed more than 11 clients
The management of La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to determine the damage caused by the institution of Joan Villa Dilmé's criminal behavior, a caretaker who, in the meantime, was employed here - killed at least eleven seniors who were cared for.
The director of this home for Senior Joan Sal has come to the escort of the device lawyer Joan Canad, and he announced that "the wish of the home of La Caritat would be able to press charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "the law and accountability of us undertake to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to damage to a good name, which this institution may suffer because it has not detected a criminal activity in a timely manner, the large threat to the home of La Caritat now constitutes material compensation requirements which already account for legal representatives of the families of the survivors.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime was already committed in August 2009 and that he had not ceased to kill since then.
The judge ordered exhumation of eight bodies of senior clients suspected that in many cases no physician looked at the deceased personally, but that - given the age and the poor health of the patients - everything was told on the phone.
La Caritat, through her director yesterday, resolutely refused this extremity and stressed that "the lack of action could not in any case be the cause of what happened".
The lawyer La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the case that, in addition to the defendant, any third party would have committed any doubt."
A man now referred to as "The Angel of Death" admitted 11 killing yesterday and stated that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed the second old man.
In this case, death by taking too high insulin doses, unlike the first case when the combination of soothing tablets was used.
Director La Caritat said it was complicated to control personnel' access to medical services.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives were probably in six cases with a nine measure that was used by this caretaker to help the patients die in their attempt to relieve them from suffering.
However, only the analysis that is now being carried out in the laboratory should show whether Vila is lying and actually looking for his first victims less cruel death or, on the contrary, killed them by giving a meadow, as he had already confessed to three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat does not believe in health claims and do not rule out that the number of people killed may be higher than he confessed to, and justify his behaviour in various versions which he gave Villa judgment knowing that he had to change his actions when it appeared to have killed eight people.
Therefore, they say that they want to be available to justice to illuminate the entire range of this matter.
European Central Bank threatens
The investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of President Trichet of the European Central Bank, which pointed out that "tress should not underestimate our ability to react".
Over 5% of the European Bank's shares have fallen by force.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to be wrong - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the non-destructive market, which, although falling, recovers - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
Investors will take some time to lose their fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take back liquidity rates today, and tomorrow it will have to cancel four times in two years.
Bundesbank requested termination of the State Debt Degree plan for failure and elimination of all outstanding liquidity rates within a period of time and leaving unlimited access only for one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect liquidity rates to predict "minimum until March" and to maintain a three-month auction with unlimited access to the end of this trimester in order to guarantee liquidity by June at least.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchasing programme and that they will even notify its intensification.
If it does not meet the expectations created, it will restore the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to continue to withdraw liquidity, God will be with us!
It was the same at a convention in May, where they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds, and there was a market collapse - history could be repeated tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, the armored fists announced it on Monday, and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought many of them, which caused further market collapse.
Last year's exchange rate for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the earlier auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting the change in mood in the market after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland numbers were published representing losses Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent approximately 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15.000, before February, have the chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be settled.
Although Ireland has no credibility after the stress test was not identified in July, the amounts are acceptable under the aid plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need the approval of a new budget by Parliament and still does not have enough support, so Ireland continues to be insecurity.
Angela Merkel reduced the tone of her speech to release the tension in her face for the next EU top meeting held on December 14, on which it is necessary to reach a political compromise that would show that we are Union and we are all on the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven's Oda to joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action to be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, reduction of deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, employment recovery measures - this sounds like the four-year period from Vivaldi to the ears of investors.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish Stock Exchange increased by 4.5%, i.e. twice as much as other European storms.
Unlike February, the government and the Spanish National Bank's response was quick and convincing - we are probably looking forward to the surprise effect.
Today we have a key bond licensing for three years, which will be favoured by Trichet's effect, which is why, we hope, there will be a great demand for it that will help to distract the doubt about our ability to refinance.
Requesting a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash that we don't need - in El Tesoro there is 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - further high rates and access to markets would close down the hay die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the Imperial Women's Strategy - "not only to be that but also to seem".
We can do it.
The President of the Eulen Group will discuss the meetings of Vega Sicilia, requested by his children
A storm in an open conflict in the Álvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, neuticha.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack him after considering him as "insignificant", the legal proceedings of El Enebro planned for the 16th month and required five of his seven descendants, on which they should attempt to force their majority and take advantage of the administrative authorities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are in charge of the legal group for the new chapter of their dispute on the control of part of society.
The founder of the largest holding company service does not seem willing to mention in his dispute the membership of El Enebro ruling authorities.
Of her administrative committee, five of its seven descendants were established, who were named for the foreman during the meeting of shareholders on 18 January this year, and the objection is raised in the Commercial Register.
The meeting of El Enebro planned for the 16th month, which was called by the Commercial Court official number 2 in Madrid, renewed the thunder in the womb of the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge is until the dispute is resolved by the only legal means guaranteed by the call of the committee.
The last step by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira of the Álvarez Mezquiriz considers David Álvarez "a desperate means of his five children serving through judicial error and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the negotiations of 18 January, which was completely invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal assault of this act as "a wholeless thing".
Protagonists who are discreetly silent tried to call the court in June without success.
In El Enebro, a group owning another activity of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David Álvareze 100% capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires the right to receive 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue which the judge will have to decide when to review the question of the judicial assault, and the date of this trial has not yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapons from Siemens
Software proposes improvement in real-time vehicles.
Since Red Bull fell into Formula 1 series in 2004, his history in this exceptional world has been characterized by surprises and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibilities of this new incoming team, and despite the upcoming trend in recent times, they all sat on a triumph by Ferrari Fernanda Alons.
Without wanting to reduce the driving skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibility of the Renault engine, who drives his car, in the Formula 1 world, was born a legend - a secret weapon, which the Multinational Siemens put into the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulation of the marches put on the market by the German company in 2007 for the purposes of a very remote automotive sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software instrument, was used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in energy plants and for high precision instruments.
Its aim is to reproduce a product faithfully or simulate a process before it is actually created, avoiding unnecessary errors and spending.
The PLM has facilitated the development of Canon, Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this software machine enabled the Red Bull team to perform "by running several hours, in almost real time" modification and improvement, which are otherwise detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992, an average of 10 technicians who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements during one period were employed.
in the Red Bull team today works at 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology that analyze and propose each type of modification of racing vehicles.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all elements of the racing vehicles Red Bull, except the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security components are modified.
The changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit for this technical exemption is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum which each Formula 1 team can issue for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a high technology plant about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
This is two buildings to which visit is limited - especially to journalists.
All that's going on here is considered a "big secret."
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people including two pilots - Vettela and Mark Webber champions.
The hero of the Red Bull is in Formula 1 without doubt the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, other protagonists whose help is priceless and yet no one knows them are hiding behind the immeasurable technological means that the brand of energy drinks has put into its participation in racing circles.
The Chief of Production Technology Steve Nevey claims five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in vehicle research and development contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest was the merit of riders.
At the moment, this ratio has changed and technology is worth the success of 85% while pilots contribute from 15%.
Newey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, as they are "non-predictable gladiators".
HP will establish its own shops in cooperation with local distributors in two years 20
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with her business partner Pont Reyes opened her first exclusive shop in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first of the 20 stores in the area of 80 to 100 m2, which this multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These shops will also be placed in 16 already existing business houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
The Spanish Vice President HP Helena Herrer mentioned as an example of the newly rebuilt sale to Barcelona’s Gran Vía, which belongs to Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has set up a plan to establish 200 outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Srbska), the shop in Barcelona is therefore the third.
Herrer didn't want to reveal where other stores will be opened, but she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrerová, who also runs HP personnel systems, assured that the philosophy of opening business will still be the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises with exclusive design of sales equipment (with products that can be tried interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
Besides, HP also deals with the provision of business personnel.
Helena Herrer argued that it would be Frenching, and pointed out that the exclusive sales network was intended to "better customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises when buying, operating, after sale service and even packaging".
Barcelona's trade is part of a global level pilot program aimed at addressing possible problems with computer devices in warranty.
Online service is connected to a technical centre located in Maastricht (Nizezzemí).
"So we can solve problems within 10 minutes which may otherwise take up to two days."
"This system is intended specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have contract service of technical assistance", said Helena Herrer yesterday.
Sabadell assumes that over three years he will steal millions of clients from his competitors
Optimist than other bosses, delegate member of Banco Sabadell Bank, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be difficult for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of passive war.
Nevertheless, it includes a reduction in interest rates, which will try to compensate for the reduction in bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to get a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
The aim is, in addition to survival without the need to turn to public aid in FROB, to gain a market share by picking up millions of new private clients - respectively 700,000, if those who, if necessary, leave the bank - since until now and the Institute rather pushed small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and big businesses than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 companies.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients while more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or can also be said with the aim of reducing the cost of which the bank will call when it presents the results for the period.
At this time, Nmno banking institutions dare to set targets and publish them because the financial crisis has changed all plans for world banking.
Sabadell will conclude his Optima program this year, set four years ago, although initially it was for three years, but the market situation required expansion for the next period.
Clients who leave the savings will be their main target group.
At the meeting organised by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "hard and very important".
Indeed, the way from the crisis in Spain "will be long".
In addition, in two or three years, "very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although they believe that passive war - which reduces the margin - withdraws, the price of the premium for the risk paid by the banks and the savings paid for their emissions in order to receive liquidity, is already moving to the price of the loans, which compensates for the reduction of the margin.
"The degree of liquidity and funding is structural and will represent a pressure factor on loans."
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued his network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías dated 22 and 27 November.
He also recognised that the trends in banking "now is the reduction of commissions" but there is a "concession framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not for nothing assures that in Spain they will demand greater size.
"The next year will not remain on the stone", he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are "decreasedly reduced" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions enter between red numbers.
It points out that the FROB may, on the market, impose a collection of funds in front of new capital measures.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it continues to pose a serious problem of what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued but, unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding through tariff review, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of sulphite fusion
The CEO of CECA rejected yesterday that further wave of mergers should arise and again insisted on the speed with which the sector reorganizations are carried out.
When the association process of the Spanish savings started, several institutions were found not to participate in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation (CECA) José Antonio Olavarriet voted yesterday that a new wave of these operations should arise.
"I believe that most mergers have already been carried out, the Cajasol in the Banca Civica group cannot be regarded as the second round, what happens is conventions".
"It is possible that instead of 17 constitutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has worked very well on this matter," noted the director.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (Association of the leaders and executive officials of the Aragon - note that the Olavarrieta said that the process of concentration was "the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied as it appears in the instalments that, not now, appeared in the business plans by the National Bank of Spain", stressed.
"Go from 45 savings with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75.500 million is a process which does not have a comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make these larger and thus to fall in accordance with the Basel Treaty".
Olavarrieta recognised that "there are many unsustainable views of the slowness of the process", which show "the lack of seriousity and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank does is reminding us that we have to be in time before the end of the year".
The CEO of CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain had the most stringent financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world, and the questionable ones, he attributed "a lack of knowledge".
The director noted that, in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" regarding financial institutions and the savings system, which managed the "very important" process of concentration and which continues "the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro but has laid down the conditions for the whole of the Union.
The market tension provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reduction for SMEs, by regulating private intermediary agencies or cancellation of 426 Euros for unemployed persons, up to the privatisation of 49% AENA (Spain airports and air traffic management - p.e.,, the manager of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipa Gonzálí, joined the other side of the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel's address for her responsibility for the resolution of the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
Tell us in advance that Merkel's opinion is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of euro redefining.
And here Germany has a radical new vision about what its future should be, which reflects the idea of following the old traditions that are held by a large part of the other members.
In Germany, the face of European resistance is beginning to speculate on three possible paths from the crisis.
The first represents a strong euro area, which would be Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, while southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the March - although it can now appear as a scifi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to German proposals, the conversion of the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary tightness, fines for the guilty countries, possible delays for some of them, and the expansion of possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so now it is not space for coasters.
First, in 2009, both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encouraged the deficits, pulled the German Government’s constitution reform out of its sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of contradiction between what Germany considered to be right (the plans of fiscal integrity and stability of public finances), and what its European partners, including France, have practiced.
The other showed this Central European country when Merkel painfully covered Greek rescue decisions.
It was already the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion that was also published was strongly against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last October, Merkel appeared with a clear opinion once it required the reform of the European Union Convention in order to enable the rescue of a Member State and at the same time to have privacy for creditors to bear part of the cost.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European, as it has accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a rather mild form, has been approved, and over the next months we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has set out a red line which is unlikely to cross.
And we all know that although there is a need to take action that seems to disagree with, it will end with the old functioning of the euro from that date.
2013 will constitute the birth of a new monetary zone in which Member States breaking the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to declare the delay of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the cost.
Germany suggests that we must give ourselves a strict way to grow with an increase in savings and investment, moderate consumption, improve productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and building, with huge balance of payments gaps, which was ruled in the years of the boom of Spain's growth, simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
It is not only a renewal of the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much harder.
And the worst part is, under these conditions, we could be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these present turbulence will calm down more.
And that we're going to use the opportunity they're giving us in spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his double declaration (reforms promised after the meeting with the big enterprises from last Saturday and yesterday's notification of the new measures) made it aware that through criticisms on Merkel's address, the path of thinking that things should be right.
However, the red line that Germany has set out is here, and it doesn't seem to want to move with it.
Out of the options to be considered, it cannot be excluded from the euro area full of unsustainable countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sports and trade in rules
Finns, as Alonso and Ramos presented in a fight with Ajax, show the saviour not the intention to escape punishment.
The alleged disfellowshipment of two Realu Madrid players (Xabi Alons and Sergio Ramose) in the Ajax League game of 23 November caused the sea to be written in ink about whether this is or is not a non-portistic behavior, and whether both football players should not be punished eventually by UEFA.
As is known, several minutes before the end of the match (who had clearly won) appointed players one by one by design lost time at a time when the foul was to be played to provoke the orchard, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way both players will fulfill the prescribed punishment in the following fight against the Auxerre - taking Real Madrid to their lead group - and they will be able to get rid of cards, continue to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Commission gave Coach José Mourin's penalty for two matches and the guilty players received a cash fine.
The provocation of yellow cards under similar conditions is no new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is a part of the football age, i.e. rules that are unsolicited, but follow.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that the team Real Madrid (which boasts nobleness and honors in its anthem, who has already been penanced for similar actions by his player), and, as it seems, also thanks to the dramaticness of Mourinhem, which adds to its long history of comedy and provocative another episode.
in any case, the debate is about whether this type of act which is not specifically prohibited is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is a circumvention of the law in these works; this is indeed an action respecting the sporting rules, of which the sense of which seems to be trying to circumvent.
The type of damage such an act can be said to be a sports spirit.
One of the elements of sport behavior is physical intactibility of opponents that have not been violated in these cases, or there is no violent game.
Another of these features characterizing the pure game is to avoid players from having an advantage to the team, which is not the case here either.
Thus, paradoxical at Realu Madrid's action is the fact that what we normally characterize as lesity or abuse of the law did not result in a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behavior was to be as evident as possible in order to receive the penalty.
They waited, and they liked the punishment.
The next question, though, is what benefit the guilty will have from their intentional transgression.
Here it is necessary to note that the opponent does not get to a disadvantaged position and that there is no advantage in the current match, as the evident consequence of this is that the team itself will have fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage clearly lies in the fact that players will begin the next phase of the League of Masters without cards, which could jeopardise their participation in the next match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of indetermination, i.e. the team may be eliminated at first glance, and in addition to this, the players will be reinstated to the second round of cards, in which one card is enough to exclude than in the first round.
So, as the wheels continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short and well, these negotiations do not go against the spirit of sport, the part of which is to make strategic decisions that enable maximum benefit under the rules.
In the case of which we are dealing here, players did not have the goal of avoiding the granting of a penalty (which would be a clear case of circumventing the rules), but rather choose when to submit themselves to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding punishment or running away from him.
Although there is no limit between the duplicity and the circumvention of the rules quite clear, I believe that in this case, it was clearly a piece of work.
It seems to me that the field arises for two reasons: because it was two self-declarations and because of the way the instruction was passed to provoke them from leadership.
The damage to the sports principles of these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Battle of offers for hosting Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar dictate concentrates the Lavin reservation this year on 16th and 17th December.
A celebration of the employees themselves who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros has come quickly.
As well as Turkish honey or lottery lotteres, pre-occupation parties are coming again, still operating as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and facilities for leisure in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis they have resulted in the fight to get clients by reducing prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros for food, agree with the business and association survey from this sector.
In order to complete the complications of the numbers, he concentrated the calendar this year (when Christmas came on Friday) requests for a week from 13 December, thus creating an avalanche of bookings at peak days (16th and 17th), while in the previous week there was almost no operation.
As has been happening since 2008, when the skinny years began, there are many companies that have abolished collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to leave tradition, many employees pay their spend on parties from their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the border of kidnapping, claims the president of the association of restaurants Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patron of the restaurant facilities is not now considering what the celebrations will be like for this month.
"People will think well before they make reservations."
"They want to get along, but when it comes to price, they're careful," he adds.
Shops will go well to those "who offer quality and good service at a favourable price", she says and recalls that thanks to the crisis customers tend to go down by step and most of the customer wants to spend about 25 euros now.
Examination in various facilities shows that the biggest support for booking applications is for the evening of December 17th.
The Soteras Group reported a real reserve boom for this Friday, most of which is to spend up to 30 euros, adjusted by the menu, whose total prices are between 25 and 30 euros.
in another major company, which is Andilana, which is 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought more early-term bookings this year since the beginning of November.
"We have made possible and impossible to maintain prices from last year, and our menu, each of which should choose, ranging from 19.95 to 30 euro", states.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after they have recorded a profit increase since the second half of the century and have a relatively solid outlook for Christmas markets.
The resources of this company stress that 18 December will also be a busy day, as they will celebrate the pre-war celebrations between friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menu, with a budget of 30 euros or more, because they recorded a 10% more exchange rate compared to last year's tendency to spend last year on another item such as a coffee (Spain sparkling wine - ref.).
They have also noted that companies that call their employees again are already emerging and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly greater.
Vice President Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as Asociace bars, restaurants and centres of free time in Barcelona) Enrico Goma believes that it is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has "lived" although clients "speak at maximum".
Even during Christmas celebrations, this impression did not go away, no matter who pays, points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has brought about great unrest in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "with a faster pace than any other country."
The Wikileaks documents confirm the ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the United States embassy in Pakistan and the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs published by the Wikileaks portal confirms the extraordinary restlessness which in Washington encourages the Pakistani nuclear program.
In addition to clear and important details that they offer regarding the content of communication and ideas of representatives of North American diplomacy in Islam, these documents reveal that cooperation between both States in terms of nuclear safety, instead of increasing itself, 'is at retreat' and that these unstable Asian countries produce 'more nuclear weapons than any other state'.
The strangeness of the Pakistani nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored after parts to make their destruction more difficult in the event of an attack - represents one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This includes Anne W. Patterson's ambassador in Pakistan in one report prior to the visit of the then advisor to national security, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear devices to the Taliban, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenal and program of managed missiles is no longer observed only by the US, but also by Russia, as it spreads and represents a reason to be alert.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with strict religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; due to the fall in the level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programs or programmes managed by missiles", said Jurij Korolev expert from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their US counterparts.
The most recent documentation published by Julian Assange's server is increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the topics of nuclear weapons spread and the increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
Depeše issued by the embassy in May which qualify for communication with Pakistan as "frustration", says: "Transparity often does not exist; aid offers remain unanswered or rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, reports that "and despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world."
Ambassador Petterson also calls on Washington to, during his visit to Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, "very well explained", that the "Pakistani army must end with quiet support to terrorist groups".
Hon to boss Wikileaks
Obama appoints a highly built worker responsible for combating terrorism to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" to track down and determine where Assange could be.
Everything about the Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange makes a complicated labyrinth, where it's hard to be sure of facts.
Interpol announced last night the "immotive call", the red note, to "location and monitoring of movement" Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but it dates back to November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the last leak more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with accusations of sexual abuse against Australia in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer assures the creator of Wikipedia Mark Stephens that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assang".
It was 20 November when the International Police Council, based in French Lyon, issued this order at the request of Sweden, did not publish it until yesterday when he received permission from Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 countries of Interpol have guidance to identify or locate Assange 's purpose of filling it in and issuing it.'
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of the person concerned by the red challenge, many Member States, as explained by the organization, consider the so-called red notice for allowing arrest - it must be ensured by a national file of police - especially if the States have a bilateral agreement on the issue of detentions such as Sweden and England where Assange should appear.
This step worsened Assenge’s attorneys, who published writing yesterday, where they claim that the nine-year-old founder of Wikileaks showed willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities through videoconference.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which compared with legendary Lavrentij Pavlovič Berijou, Head of Stalin's Security.
"This is a hunt, not a legal pursuit," says a letter.
While the whole world is looking for it - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange is still in the unknown place, but he doesn't remain silent.
on Monday, he provided through Skype from the unknown location of interview to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine - in this interview he demanded the Demosi Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United States of Hillary Clinton.
"If she appears to have been responsible for orders from U.S. diplomats to perform espionage at the United Nations and to violate the international conventions that the United States has signed, she should withdraw," he said.
His opinion yesterday was rejected by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for dementia as "murder and absurd".
"I am not absolutely sure why we should care about the individual that operates the website," said CNN.
Obama itself has committed a highly built worker responsible for combating terrorism, Rusella Travers, in order to prevent further leaks.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop adding Assang to the importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators have made these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will be chairing the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber since January, has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to examine the possibility of including the Wikileaks among the terrorist organizations, "to intervene and prosecute anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide them with assistance".
Tom Flanagan, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went on to say that Assange should be "killed," which then had to appeal.
"We both should write a reward on him or use a flight free or something like that."
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former Governor Arkansas and a possible candidate for the president.
"Whoever will be in the government, whoever is responsible for leaking information, commits treason and any other punishment than execution would be too mild," said Fox Station.
Puigcercós is looking for peace at the ERC on Carod's trailer
The Republican leader will allow the party to hold secret votes.
Huguet proposes more plural performance and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós apparently found a recipe to fight with a number of internal revolutions in the ERC series (Levicé republican party of Katalánska - readst.), without prejudice to the loss of 11 Members and half votes.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture regarding the demos seems to the supporters of the former leader Josepa Lluíse Carod-Rovira not sufficient, and also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weakened as his leader himself, and that he cannot absolutely worry about what he had with other disappearing currents.
That's why Leader Levice will try to get new criticisms using a wink to help him defend himself in the local elections.
First Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be secretly able to speak to his/her adherence in office.
Using voice mails, not by raising your hand.
If Carod’s supporters wish to deliver a criminal voice to the chairman, they will be able to make a retribution measure without fear.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid a split and subjecting his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but he added without specifying the percentage that it would also not be a good result of 'Bulgaria'.
Carod’s Stoupents demand more from the President than to give his function available - which they consider to be a gesture which has no weight, since Puigcercós controls the largest authority at the conventions.
However, given that they do not have sufficient majority to enforce the demos, they will try to recall the plan from now on until May.
For this reason, they expect to participate in the drafting of a strategic reorientation document, which will give leadership the vote on the National Council on the 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to move Congress already in autumn 2011.
Leader ERC has stated that "munity" is damaging stability and that its aim is to enable the organisation to once and for all to be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, it seems to be an obvious article that current adviser Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After considering Puigcercós' ideaology, he took this innovation counselor for the complete cause that the leader would be confirmed by the "exchange for several goals".
And he named those five, of whom two stand out.
The first is the "complementation" of the executives so that it represent at least 90% of the members, which also includes new faces which are from the sector inclined to Carod.
The second target can be a big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC fully terminates its meeting as a mechanism of operation.
In this way, he is fighting for the reform of the Statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates selected by voting.
Completing with the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish political system, is the intended objective of the Puigcercós team, which in this respect fought at the last two conventions.
However, the 2008 Hamstery Assembly decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special Congress on the Reforms of the Statutes.
This issue is still unsolved, as the situation inside the party has discouraged this issue.
Now, without the whining critical sectors, it could be a good time to re-examine this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 for 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico reported a fall of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than in the previous month, as MILENIO said.
There are cases of three women among murders and a couple of separate bodies in the Gulf of Mexico.
Last month, a total of 390 killings in Mexico, probably linked to organized crime.
In the case of cases there is a discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the Toluca district.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a wound from grace to the head, and had arms and legs tied with rope.
The next day the body was found in the trunk, which was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the capital of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the Naucalpan district.
Early in the morning on Thursday, November 4, the cooperatives discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal shots in the chest at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the section of Villa Guerrero district.
A report signed by the most likely criminal organization La Familia Mikoacan was found near the body.
A day later, a 50 - year - old man was murdered by eight shots in Nehualcóyotl after he left his home and wanted to start picking up garbage.
On November 7, two victims were killed in the head at the age of 30 in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, Ecatepec County.
In Chalco, El Naranjo's remote path was found dead body shot in the forehead, and a 25 caliber casing was found under the body.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the drain of wastewater in Playa Golondrin colony.
Rescue files have made a thorough search for other parts of it, but they haven't been found.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlán reported the finding of the body with their hands tied back and her head wrapped in Pena Colorado.
A man had a gunshot wound to his back.
In the middle of the month, two men who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizapán de Zaragoza have also been reported in the victim threatening death.
A day later, it was found in the Valley of Valle de los Reyes in Los Reyes La Paz cardboard box that contained the human head.
The rest of the body was found in the nearby colony, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
Seventeen were found two dead women wrapped in bed linen in the Zoquiapan settlement in the Ixtapaluca district, and the next morning, a man killed in Huixquilucan was found in a yellow-proof umbrella, which was previously reported to have been left with his body identified as Mario Ríos.
In Ixtapaluca a woman was found in the village of San Francisco Acuautla without signs of life with two injuries to the back.
A tattoo of the sacred figures of Santa Muerte was discovered on the skin of the woman (the Holy Death literally "recognitional death") and also the necklaces with its likeness.
At the end of the month, a corpse of a man was found in the village of Zinacantepec in the car with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, two men were found in the village of Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In the victim, the report was probably written by one of the crime organizations in which it said, "This will happen to those who will not adapt".
Two bodies were found in Ecatepec, which bore signs of torture and tied limbs, inside an abandoned taxi behind the Centre of Justice in the San Agustín colony.
The last day of the month two men were found in the Los Reyes La Paz and Nehualcóyotl districts.
The first of them was beheaded and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, bound with a tape and had a left hand; while the other was tortured and found in a plastic box in the streets of Colonia Juarez.
They found an agent with him and a note with a message.
China complies with its objective to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of this country at the UN climate change conference COP16 assured that its country developed extraordinary efforts to reduce carbon footprints and clarified its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% to 45% in 2020, guaranteed by Su Wei, representative of this country at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said that his country has already invested $445 million in reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the last four years.
However, he noted that China would not change its objectives and continue working with the international community on this issue.
He preferred that China’s climate change strategy was divided into the following four elements: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and pilot support.
In all of these points, progress has already been made, including last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, explained.
In addition, he stressed that the federal authorities co-operated with the province and local authorities in China to achieve their energy savings goals, energy efficiency and emission reductions.
Further, as he said, they are in progress or have already been completed by various multiannual plans financed by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
For example, as stated, the Programme for Energy Effective Use, which has been implemented over the past five years, has received investments from the UN, government and private initiatives.
It is also running the province project for climate change, as well as a project for the exchange of bulbs for energy-saving bulbs and for the mitigation and adaptation project, it has clarified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a expert advisor to this country for climate change, assured that China’s efforts were greater than they thought in general.
For example, he cured, greenhouse gas emissions per capita in China represent 6 tonnes, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
The same has developed unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, in the last five years it has increased 20% energy efficiency and expects to make further progress by 2020, he has added.
Disfellowship Espina: César Nava
The National President of the Polish Party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party - ref. kalt.) said that the former Chairman of this party is entitled to request the National Order Commission with his law.
The National President of the Polish Party, César Nav Vazquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was established and that the former chairman of this party was entitled to contact the National Board of Governors and to claim his right.
in an interview, which was taken before an objection was raised by the Governor of the State of Gabin Cué Monteagud, said that the exclusion of Espina is in any case a decision taken at local level.
"It's one of the Autonomous Decisions of the Order Committee in Sonar."
"Mr. Espino has the right to contact him in his case through a complaint to the National Board of Governors in order to act as a decision made by the competent authority", he added.
He further explained that there is no time to think about 2012 and that it was never at the negotiation table about the Presidency candidature of the Alliance.
Nava Vazquez expressed his conviction that the PAN would come out of the internal elections held in the following 4th and 5th December, in which his successor would be elected, strengthened.
"This (alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it was the intention for local elections that were successful and achieved its purpose", he noted.
The President of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue was behind him, and therefore "we lack internal competition, on the other hand, we benefit from it and strengthens us," he added.
He said that the committee could choose the best chair or chairman for the next three years of the PAN, without a debate, so he's going to hand over the relay to "whom the committee designates".
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, to any one of those five proudly hand over to the President's Office."
He foretold that the increase, recorded by the party in the last July elections, would be reflected in future deposits, although "is not yet time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabina Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, having roots in the alliances in Oaxace, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, since "there are many expectations and desires in them, and I am sure that Gabino will keep those expectations up".
When we asked him to criticize President Felipe Caldex aside PRI (Partido Revolutionionario Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party, read.) Because of his speeches within four years of reigning, César Nava invited the members of PRI to think about six years of the former Presidents Ernesta Zedilla and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
"If they believe in PRI that the Zedilla and Salinase governments were better than the rule of Fox and Clades, then let them begin to defend them, to come out of their utility," he admitted.
He said that the Chief of Federal Power has the right to express himself as he did during the National Auditorium, because there is no gag or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes on Twitter a law to support students without proof
"If you think that the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and insist that this law is approved", tweet the American President on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama has today contributed to his personal account of the Twitter social network to national mobilization in support of the Dream Act law, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you think that the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and insist that this law is approved," tweet Obama.
His short report draws attention to the internet reference to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to contact the senators without delay, as the vote on this law is approaching.
"If it is expected that the vote will take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion shine," he points.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened by blocking the approval of any law, unless an extension of the tax reduction from the Bush era and government financing was approved.
Such blocking, which was announced by letter signed by 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote on the Law of Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential speaker said that he believed that once the fiscal theme had been resolved, it would be possible to set up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still enough time left..."
"We all agree that we need to resolve the issue of taxes before the end of the year..."
I believe that we will be able to reach an agreement on this matter at some point and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters," he said.
Leader of the democratic majority of the Senate Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote on the conclusion of the discussion" regarding the Dream Act law, so that the proposal for legalisation of students without documents could be voted in the Chamber from next Thursday, although the more likely is next week.
Dream Act, or the "American Dream" Act, would legalize some 800,000 young people who had reached the United States before they were 16 years old, staying in the country for the last five years and were admitted to higher education institutions or to the army.
However, its supporters need 60 votes to be approved, so they need the assistance of several Republicans, so that the organisation of its supporters is making intense agitators to ensure that this law is approved.
The Democrats, most of whom Dream Act supports, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, stated that he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support to this law.
Therefore, participants of Dream Act need to get several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the supporters most negotiate are Senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the retiring senator from Florida George Lemieux, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have previously supported Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they said they won't support him anymore.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has not yet expressed himself.
Although the House of Representatives attaches itself to another version, according to most analysts, Dream Act will face the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature inserting the finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "input the finger into the wound" is the window of the Czech "to hit the nail on the head - it is remembered.)
The second round of the language pleasure cycle was the promenade where participants presented the literary gala performance
"I understand this with Sex in the language, but... the punch in the wound? What is waiting for me?", asked writer Luis Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Appetizership from language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at another fair, they devoted themselves to Sex in the round table in the language, explained).
The breast in the wound of "us brings us to the narrows", said the Austrian writer to the audience, composed mainly of young people, who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara, to listen to this debate at round table, moderated by Marisol Schultz and Valenzuel, Sergia Ramirez, Mayry Monterová and Luis Garcíi Monter.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text dedicated to Gonzal Celori, which Schultz later referred to as a great story in which Luis was first performing as a protagonist who, in search of the knowledge of the morning, comes from a physician who does not answer her although the trace of the same story yes.
From an infectologist leaving convinced: "Trueness is not my strong suit, maybe it will be my wound."
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the way, but explained that the morning is not a scientific term, he's a psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the morning represents the truly open and the symbolic scar".
The protagonist has lightened down and concluded that "the wound has only been able to learn so much that it is truly distraught and that it does not exist" but has acquired the belief that pleasure and extermination in the language must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuel played both.
Mr Sergio Ramírez also stepped up with a pleasant narrative called the Praise Invention, in which the finger is not appointed in the wound, but at one point appears.
With the elements of the magical realism, she talks about a famous witch who played clouds, brought back people who have gone far, or fixed the virtue that one virgin lost, this story that then turned to speak America, a great novel, in which they had not missed his own chronicles, who had told him, and is quoted here by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the misdemeanors in telling the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invented all of us (the writer), mocked the fake testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but in other ways never managed to tell the story of America with such an imagery that even the wells lacked."
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have bigger imaginations" and just where reality is falling apart and a lie where they no longer know what the story belongs to one group and, as far as the other, it reaches the fictional literature of its peak.
That is what "cervantite tradition" calls.
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
As a result, Maya Monter stressed and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation to the International Book Fair with her late Prst allowed.
Cuban-portoric writer has shown her finger to a large wound to the social violence that passes through her country - and it is shared by Latin America - and is a consequence of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a silent compromise, which is not intended of course," she said after she said that the reality of literature is communication and dimension of a compromise created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero closed the Spanish poet, whose performances also put the emphasis "on this finger into the wound of the writer bound by the writer".
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual habits and control of the consciousness that ingestes dogmatism, he forgets, "that behind every attraction there is little no, and behind every denial there is also a small yes."
"To be masters of our thoughts and reality, we need to color: and to dye it means to put a finger in the wound many times and bother those individuals who are much more comfortable because they think in cartoons, black and white, in sophisticated ideas and without colour, and to bother also the authorities that prefer this black and white world", he said to support the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Ruben Omar Romano has three defeats in the final, and during his career he has experienced good and bad, but he has already managed to reach on three occasions on the decisive series.
In Santos Laguna and Monterey's duel in the finals, in addition to this two different styles characterised by their techniques, teams that have a certain difference in the results.
Ruben Omar Romano has three defeats in the final, and during his career he has experienced good and bad, but he has already achieved three opportunities for the decisive series, but until now he has left with the undeserved, and that is why this opportunity is extraordinary for him.
Argentina had to settle for a silver medal, stay behind the winners, and curiously played with the same team the following finale.
The Santist strategist got into his first finals in the Apertura 2002 tournament when he had in his hands the mining club Morelia, with which he went 4-2 against Toluce overall; then in the Clausura 2003 tournament again joined the decisive duel and lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against Rayados team.
Already with the Santos Lagun club in the Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the Devils from Toluka, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against the "Uzenaires" (the further nickname of the Deportivo Toluca club - recognised.) after 210 minutes of the game indecently 2-2, after a series of criminal shooting he got into the benefit of three on one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but ultimately his three players passed from 11 steps and the team so suffered a turn to 4-3.
The ruben has already lost two finals against the "Black Devils" of Toluka and one against Monterey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that he is the most important institution.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm bound, and the title would be for me, of course, but the first one is the most important," said the coach when he was asked about the numbers that speak in the final against him.
In his living memory, he has a previous finale in which, as confirmed, he learned a lot, "we learned that until the referee has finished singing, we cannot celebrate, we need to be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalts, we were ready to celebrate, and I think we have learned in this, until the match ends, we cannot celebrate."
He does not worry that this series may be decided in criminal shootings, he believes to his players: "You never try to get to a series of penalty kicks, you try to end in a normal time, but sometimes there is no other option, and we need to be prepared for it, in the last tournament we were prepared, unfortunately, but fate got us a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety that we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, what left it in us and hope that something like this won't happen."
Romano has a chance in her own hands to stop being the other one and to taste the first glory they bring to the titles.
United States amends visa sharing rules
People will have to contact the Services Centres for visa applicants before interviewing the Consular Department; costs will be lower and the waiting times will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the process of discussing visas at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
with a new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Services Centre for visa applicants (abbreviated from English ASC) before interviewing the Consular Department.
ASC staff will receive biometric information from the applicant and they will be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, among which the following are envisaged:
The total cost of issuing a visa will be lower, no longer need to be paid for agreeing a meeting, the second for processing the application and another one for delivery of the transport service document.
The applicant shall pay only one fee to cover all three services.
The current tariff will not be altered: an amount corresponding to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases with applications (including temporary staff visas) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to have an interview with a consular officer, but only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and have their fingerprints taken away.
Given that biometric information will be collected in ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with an interview in the Consular Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Similarly, those who will apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra charge for the services of 26 dollars.

NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The American Space Agency called the press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break in finding extraterrestrial life.
The United States National Aviation and Space (NASA) announces tomorrow, Thursday, astrobiological discovery, which could confirm the theory of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock by experts on astrobiology, a science that deals with study of origin, evolution, spread and future life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited journalists, NASA assured that she would introduce a "sign that would cause a break in finding extraterrestrial lives", which gave rise to speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in unholy conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and who could represent the possibility that one of them would become intelligent creatures, such as people, if the conditions in which they live are improved.
According to the appearance, it is a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered to be too toxic for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenal.
In some way, treble uses arsenic to his life, and this is what his ability increases the probability that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms are used in their metabolism of arsenic, it will prove that "there is another second form of life, different from that we know".
The Space Agency will notify the actual reach of discoveries at the press conference tomorrow.
The conference will participate in the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who examine Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón bear the opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism", declared.
The 60th parliamentary period was not even started when there was an opposition block in Congress, led by MPs of the parties of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democratica, Czech "Strana Democratic Revolution" - read.), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Strán dág" – přil.), Convergencia (česky "Shoda" read.) and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvem, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: coming "bipartism" to the House.
Prior to the opening of the 60th parliamentary period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevevo from PRD and Patrón Montalvo "hrířeli" against the reform of the Constitutional Act, because he pronounced them.
This reform, repeated, begins with "bapartism" because it will now be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos' Aquilarová, coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council led by Salvador López Brit by the PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - read.) and Luis Cárdenas Fonsecou as Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo said that these reforms institutionally constitute political marginality from the populite of PRI (Partido Revolutiononario Institutional, Czech "Revolutional Institutional Party") and PAN.
He stated that during the next few days they would be talking to representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they would be resubmitted to the two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When I come here (partial coalitions), I look at it, because we are excluded from any decision, even they have no willingness to consider the views of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from the Convergencia side, stated that the PRD, PT and Patron are compatible, and therefore they will form a plural group.
It is not possible to allow, he continued to be Congress after he was monopolic, now "duple".
Aspiring the law reform is not to be an infinite bipartism in Congress.
This group begins with five legislators and its members now talk with other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza on the part of PT explained that the Congress has now become a "circumvention" of two - in the corner of PAN and PRI.
"Only one party ruled him before, two of them today."
Patrón Montalvo asked her to respect the personality of the Member to give him a place at the same table.
"To get us five Members, which are probably nine, but right now they see us in five, they don't stay because of the clicked agreements outside, each in a different fraction, we have united to find a place at the negotiating table, because the problem is that we do not agree with the reform we have created and agreed to do so."
There are another 200,000 pesos for "contractor"
The City Hall in Mazatlán will pay for another check discussed by the company's owners supplying electromaterial.
Another check for something more than 200,000 pesos was sent by Lorena Guadalupe Camachová Palazuelos.
This is the sum paid in this second half of the company’s owners supplying electromaterials to 1.200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the City Hall, this last check was sent on November 16th of this year, was exposed to the obsnox 200.144,56 pesos and as its subject was referred to the "comparation of unpaid payments".
The container Luis Miguel López Moreno pointed out that the municipality would pay this supplier, who was followed by the State Audit Office for high price sales, would pay another price.
What has not been said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many checks will still be sent for Camach Palaluelos.
"There was nothing purchased now, only she pays what we owe her as well as other suppliers," said one conversation.
The last checks appeared in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two days on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this business has not yet been published in the Government Code, as stated by law in the case of companies audited by the State Audit Office, in order to prevent their services from using other administrative authorities, the Treasury has assured that the services of the City Hall supplier have not been used again.
In the previous period, after 25 July, Noroest’s daily revision of checks issued by the City Councillors to its suppliers revealed that over the period March 2008 to 9 July 2010, over the three-year period of mayor Jorge Abel Lópeze Sánchez paid the city of Camachová Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
This was also implemented by transactions with Jawupam, where it collected checks for over 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites necessarily need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of Sáncheze Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist to the depths of the towns of Sáncheze Taboada, the tourist sector in Mazatlán authorities demands that they pay attention to areas and places that are in bad condition and do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Association of Traders of the Zone Dorado region, reminded that they repeatedly requested the impression of destination, namely the bad that tourists find here to replace with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and walkers is acting on tourists walking through here and seeing a mess, which negatively affects nearby businesses.
"The politicians don't know what it's like to close up for one day, and they don't have any idea of the trades they're avoiding, otherwise they won't deal with these things for so long and without proper planning."
Hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused the lack of preventive measures and maintenance by city hall.
"Radnice will have to take responsibility and to avoid any such repetition, he will have to take care of preventive maintenance, not just repairing existing defects", he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, since not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, but also as residents we deserve a clean residence, the town hall should change its urban maintenance strategy".
There are other places that look neglected and poor, he observed, for example, the Mazatlan Embly and El Venadito (monumment, deer statue - it is remembered.).
"At present, in order for tourists to come, it does not matter only to promote, it is necessary to offer a good product, i.e. a town flowing with the purity of its beaches and streets where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out", he said.
"It was not necessary here to pay attention, and these facts highlight something that is well known to all, maintenance is missing.
He talked about a number of places that need to be fixed in cooperation with the town hall, said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and orderly to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Ller Martínez, a sub-secretary of the Tourist Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent as they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and space, which however will need to be fixed first, so that we can put these sites in a list that we have to promote this destination".
IP requests results after Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, would like the Members to take great responsibility by following the example of finding better Sinaloy, in the various challenges facing the state.
Parliamentary period full of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State performance calls for the business sector in Mazatlán because Sinaloa is rejecting convulsions and facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI Members, 13 from PAN, three from the Nueva Allianza Party, two from the PRD, one of the PTs, one of the Convergens and the last from the PVEM, comprising 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of Congress is to be able to carry out decent management, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work and that the same party and paternalistic consequences will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordination Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 Members of Congress take great responsibility and set an example in the way for better Sinaloa in the various challenges facing them.
"We expect Members to exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take steps to promote their own interests and become the carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary faction."
Therefore, he talked about the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary overflow to move the ruling forward in line with the order.
"We want them to do decent work and to be particularly committed to companies and sectors, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who gave them their voice in the past elections of trust."
Mr Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Isle Hotel Association, stated that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives would take all the strength to achieve country's economic growth because the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is to encourage economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support the creation of jobs in a certain way."
As regards tourism, he asked new legislators to give him greater weight in the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that this is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate since it is an important economic activity, bringing currency and investment, which in addition competes directly with agriculture."
In addition to issuing funds for start-up tourist projects, Congress should help bring state assistance to certainty and help with the alcohol law that has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
They're looking for the Three Kings.
The dolls, cars and bicycles are together with other toys on the list of children in the Coronados Valenzuel family.
For their parents, the coming feast of three kings will be difficult to fulfill, as their home is exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaac, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kashpar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them toys and clothes they desire so much.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor circumstances, as the father has no permanent work.
"Sometimes we have it hard because the husband has no luck, but we sell mandarines and potatoes... this afternoon I go out with the "plebeans" on the street to sell it," said Cayetana Valenzuelová Andrade, mother of children.
The four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bicycle while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As far as ten-year-old José Alfred is concerned, he would want some time for a monster car, and his eight-month-old brother, Jesúse, would like to wear Cayetana for one year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I'd like this monster car', but I said to him we'll see his son 'cause it was very expensive', remembers the sadness of Cayetana.
For the older kids who were at school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, is 12, ten-year-old Isaac size 10, whereas 8-year-old Miguel wears size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan's missing sneakers, so he could really use a pair of five-and-a-half-six.
To help meet the dreams of children of the Coronad family Valenzuel, you can participate in the campaign "They are looking for the Three Kings", and at the reception of the daily Noroeste bring a gift or money in cash.
14 alleged drug dealers arrested
Tours were carried out in Estria, Wednesday, under the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen were arrested and faced with various charges.
Tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places that served to manufacture drugs.
"about 750 attacks of Indian cannabis, four kilos of hash, money and equipment used to produce was confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of the police in Quebec.
There were 11 men and three women arrested, both of which were presumptuous bosses of this network, two men from Sherbrook.
The people arrested must have come to the courtroom in Sherbrook following their arrest.
They could face accusations from the production of Indian hemp, his possessions with the aim of trading with him, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These inspections followed a long-term investigation that took place for almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that enabled us to join these arrests," said M. Ruel.
This police operation took part in 70 police officers in the investigation of Estrie State Police of Quebec, the State Police of Sherbrook and the Police Administration of Sherbrook Memhrémagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any trouble.
The bill of conservatives, which, according to government, should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will obviously be overcome, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday have said that they cannot support it.
"An excellent measure of leaning against Charter."
"I'm standing right on the side of the page that built the gall under your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of liberals, surrounded by Members after a week's meeting du caus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a law that would allow a person from a ship to be held up to one year by any person identified as a ship transporting illegal immigrants, would violate Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
The chief of the Quebeck Block, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill's proposal because he was headed for the wrong goal.
"We are opposed and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," said M. Duceppe.
Ms NPD, on the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected criticisms that want her party not to be strong enough with regard to illegal immigrants.
"The Neo-democratics agree that we take action against the transferees of illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider as the base part of another draft law, C-35," said Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the bill of conservatives because it blames refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year", explained Mrs Chow.
Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused the opposition party.
"The Canadians say to the MPs that they don't tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that can be taken to the fly and treated like a parasite."
They expect Canada to take consistent action, the Minister of Kenney responded.
The government did not vote on confidence in its draft law, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative said to the QMI Agency that the government will request a vote so that every member who is against it responds to his position in front of his voters.
The new unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement, the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to require the creation of a public investigation committee for the issue.
Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, is seeking this idea not to fall into oblivion: Québec intends to consult this issue in January next year with the Department of Investment from New York.
Metropole has a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday's announcement of one of us surprised.
It should be noted that even though Robert Dutil was present, this measure was not discussed at the meeting of the Permanent Police Services Council in Quebec on 29 October last year.
There was no need for public security critics, PQ Stéphane Bergeron, to evaluate this announcement as a "circumcision pulled out of the hat" and "amateur solution to the knee".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"She's satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we report it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjean Parenta, nothing can replace the establishment of a public witness interview.
"We know Mr. Charest is convinced that he doesn't want to create this investigation commission, and people think, just like you and I that he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of an investigation committee is the demission of Jean Charest", explains Yves Boisvert, Professor of Ethics and Politics at the Institute for Education of High Public Officials.
In order to be able to come out of this dead end, he suggested that Quebec be given special mandate to the General Inspector to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the General Inspector," he said.
He also considers that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the Commissioner to allow people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the records of the Charest government.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Criminal Code so that it was better adapted for this type of crime.
This requirement would be based on the agent for Operation Marteau (Cladivo), who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the caselaw for this type of investigation was not explicable.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his judicial colleague Rob Nicholson is currently dealing with some of the amendments attached to this file.
During the Jaro 2001 operation, which hit a group of bikers, although the Criminal Code has not yet been modified, 131 persons have been arrested.
Ottawa then made changes to the Law on Gangstery.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several water flows have come under strict control due to heavy precipitation, which have fallen since Tuesday in several province regions.
In the middle of the afternoon in Shawinigan, Maurice, there was a landslide.
Two houses have been evacuated in advance.
On the evening there was another land slide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road is bent.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions hit strong precipitation, i.e. 40 to 70 millimetres.
20 to 40 more millimetres were not expected from today until Thursday night, according to regions.
The cuts in the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were hit most.
Could be a total of 100 millimetres down there.
If we count these snowfalls in some sectors, we may be afraid of flooding in some water streams.
The security service of Quebec declared a warning against the flood dangers for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers on Wednesday evening, in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides forest, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, have become the subject of flood alert and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudière, some lakes, Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcellline-de-Kildare, as well as Rawdon, caused a strong collision of divorce.
In Saint-Calixte, one provisional bridge was thrown down as a result of strong rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated.
In Outaouais, some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service has an emergency and oversees the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, a security advisor.
The Quebeck Centre for Prediction issued on Wednesday warning from powerful floods for several rivers, especially Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly blamed
The Quebecký radio moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial failure in front of the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Board (RRTV) due to controversial comments on social assistance and Haitian, as well as due to rough broadcasting during the broadcast.
The Radio and TV broadcasting Council considers that Mr Dupont and his CHOI group had the right to express their views, but some statements contained "unreasonable information on social assistance and inappropriate negative teaching of the Haitian rough expression which did not correspond to the broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussion on suicide, including the transmission of the names of both persons who took their lives, had not infringed the rules on radio broadcasting.
The radio and television broadcasting Council received several complaints regarding comments made during the transmission, broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken after the complaint of the Joint Front of the recipients of the social support of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts on the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must submit reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, the moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most of the Commission’s members concluded that the report transmitted was such that suicide could not be seen as solving the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of the 'Dupont's midday reports' have hit the delicate topic in an impartial and appropriate way."
There was no reproach against him.
The last dispute concerned the statement that followed after the earthquake in Haiti.
Therefore, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort put themselves in a media shootout that caused many reactions.
Moderator CHOI said he didn't send any gift to help the Haitians because we can't be sure that the needs actually get the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not incorrect, but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriate negative picture of the Haitians.
"I've done my three-day suspension of this thing."
"My file has been unaffected for one and a half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression.
Anyway, the CHOI-FM radio broadcasts cooperated "over their responsibilities".
For the station, which will, inter alia, have to notify this decision once during the main transmission within three days, there are minimum consequences.
King du kung fuvà Montreal.
The inhabitants of Montreal, originating in Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, have an extremely strange course.
The atlet, which stands out in "sanda" (Kung-fu "full connect"), in kickbox and Thai box enters dads and ringes all over the world and searches for new challenges.
"I began with martial arts like kung fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explaining Zemmal, who lived in the capital since 2008, to study with professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches a little bit everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appear in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this person who works as a security guard and has just added bad news to his opponents when he won two gold medals at World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edimburg, Scotland.
"I won the kickbox category full connect and Thai box, I said."
"Now I'm getting ready to go to China for World Cup in san shou."
"They were invited by opponents who ended up with the first four at the final World Cup in each category."
"I won a bronze in Toronto in 2009.
"In 2005, I ended eight in Vietnam."
"In 2007 in China I ended up in a tournament on the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I ended third, added."
"The interesting thing is that I've made some progress in every competition."
"This is the first time I'll be this year or the eve!"
"san shu" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where punches are grown and legs, as well as chasing the ground, allowed.
The games are traditionally played on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer in this form of fighting is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
As Nacer Zemmal has only one result in his career, he will confirm his bold participation in the "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl in Kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains the nicest guy."
"It's kind of equivalent to Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg) before he suffered a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, analyzed."
"There are four rivals for category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"Victs semi-finals are stuck in the finals of their category."
"Then there are winners of every category to be crowned one champion, King of Kung Fu."
450 million without public competition
Hydro-Québec agreed, after the 450 million agreement, in contracts with companies providing an engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this avalanche, more than 100 contracts are the consortium created by BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor, which received the most significant contract, the project management contract totalled at $295 million without a public competition.
This consortium, named Énergie Gérance, had been combined with the selection of Hydro-Québec in 2004 to be responsible for managing this significant hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005 the "Énergie Gérance" consortium was awarded a Luxembourg contract without any publication of the competition.
For Quebec, a complaint against consortia businesses puts us in the face of a serious ethical problem that risks the exclusion of competition and causes an increase in prices.
"It's a new way to realize the collisions and eliminate the competition."
"This means that people, no more secret side agreements, are already making them openly," said PQ Sylvain Simard yesterday at a press conference.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he says he hardly bears how public interest can be sold as such.
Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, in the afternoon she said, strongly denying that this contract would be about collusion.
"I have my own path", she smothered and claimed that PQ was "inferred" and "predicted accuracy".
She said that "that would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for the creation of a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
It is usually an alliance, limited in time, which enables two or more undertakings to pool up their mutual expertise so that they can respond to the call for proposals for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the scope of the work.
Construction is already running and must be broken down by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without competition to act; it was a trade.
It is also necessary to admit that the formula of the consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
How he discovered last week Le Devoir, the form of a consortium in the field of consulting in the engineering is the subject of an investigation into the government.
If we fly over the speed of the quebské firm's trading register, this will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be created permanently.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and this is Dessau.
As regards the consortium of Énergie gérance, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the territory of la Baie James is a typical special dynamic of labor and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), provided an explanation that forces us to throw our forehead over the fact that the project management contract was concluded in mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public competition and if there are few participants in the competition offering, your prices may be higher."
"You have two choices to choose: that you will collect people who are in that contract as participants in the competition, and that you will say, "Let's make a deal satisfactory and with a good price."
"But the main idea is that it's not a price, it's a human competence," said Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Énergie Gérance is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by Strana Quebec.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification of Le Devoir, he counted 109 contracts for consulting in the field of engineering concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or branches, in particular laboratories carrying out soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin summed up 22 contracts, of which Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a share in the "Énergie gérance".
All contracts have been concluded.
The meetings include $449,783,344, including the contract with Énergie Gérance at $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard indicated that four companies, which are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor), are "very good known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau released the report that PQ is also associated with companies that "finance it" before she clarified that it was rather her management staff.
The responsible consumption barometer - "green" label does not encourage confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Georgian consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in the "non-partite" signs and environmental certificates, in order to follow the product selection.
The worst part is that even though we bathe ourselves in the media universe, who insists on us and urges us to receive socially more responsible consumption, this media universe speaks about the lack of credible information, the failure to fulfil the obligation which even qualify as a brake for its commitment, reports Barètre's responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Even though consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the people of Quebec who are trying to sell it still do not believe them.
Two-thirds of us actually say that they do not believe in the promises of companies relating to the environment, simply because green advertising companies finds a measuring tool that has developed the Observatory's responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of the consumers doubt the credibility of the official certificates attached to such fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands referred to as ecologically responsible, Barometers.
In the same way as the policy debate on this topic, only 14.6% of the people of Quebec are accepted as serious.
However, information on the responsible consumption appears to be the primary point for stimulating this site of consumption, which is now almost a third of thequebian consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable nature of the information would ease the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baremètre at the higher price of these products.
In fact, a third of Quebekuse’s inhabitants build unbelievingly against the reported data on products or "green" services that we seek to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of the consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products, thus responding to their convictions.
All 61% of them preferred shopping for traders from their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food grown in their region, says Barorètre.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , the Homo consumus Québek is pleased to be presented as king of recycling, which aims for the least impact on the environment by taking care of animal protection.
But apparently, their social and environmental conscience remained outside their car somewhere, says Barorètre: in 2010, only 28% of the population of Quebec reported using public transport or recommending the use of a car to ride at least two people, in order to protect nature.
The walking and round also supported 39.1% of participants in this extensive behaviour survey who used this cliché.
State loan to buy a cinema complex eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which we have requested financial participation in the redemption of the complex of cinemas eXcentris, Angus et le Parallèle, agrees with them but only to the amount of the loan.
The Developper Society "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a donation of $7 million from the Minister of Culture to buy a cinematographic complex on Saint-Laurent's boulevard, which proved its mission as a lover of film art, did not see what she demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected gift, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan, which would, in fact, be lower, some were the original expectations which could build the basis for viable solutions under advantageous conditions and with sources coming from the state.
The first action plan and the demand for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec in spring last year, but the requests have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and the action plan was sent by the Minister St-Pierre to the President of the Society for Business Development in Culture (SODC), François Macrola, who is running the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent 10 days ago.
But the government counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus has until 31 December to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of the gift from the state must really be rejected.
Let us remind you that the association of cinema owners and cinematographic centres in Quebec was opposed to direct investment by the state in order to support the redemption of eXcentris, stating that the Minister of Culture should not finance a project concerning real estate when it did not work for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several participants in the discussion required substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the space of his cinemas during the ten years of film art after he financed the construction of the complex himself, which could be the reason for the amendment by the Financial Council of the State.
The lack of halls for independent films is loud in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to get a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, is running the campaign to release funds into the private sector, in the belief that they will tear down 700 000 $ for the enforcement of acquisitions.
Since spring 2009, the only three film companies Le Parallèle continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future tenants is to open all three halls again on February 27th of next year and reflect the most beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remind Le Devoir and so ignore himself, so he and his group think about the emphasis on the reduction that they are doing to him.
The raised tire on Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic American springs known through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of the undervalue of Canadians against Americans, but they also express their sense of superiority to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that at every Canadian electorate, they lie at the heart of Canadian-American relations when they go to vote, and believe that President Obama's visit helped conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new reports between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, last night exposed to the public, provide additional sensitive details to get "under the skin" to each other.
The communication with the 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details the point in which the United States are not part of the betting facilities that political leaders are discussing.
To the great honor of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides some explanations for this situation.
"The less-priced Canadian complex, almost stuck, mentions perhaps political leaders to talk about internal stakes, instead of realizing that these elections also apply to the United States (as in the campaign on free trade in 1988)" he writes.
"The United States are therefore", he concluded, "a literal elephant in the following elections: all present but potentially too dangerous to talk about them".
The ambassador understands this "gloating silence" less so that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, party or even better boss of the parties to manage these important relations should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to elections."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'Affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your path will help to ensure that the government retains confidence in the vote at the beginning of February on a federal budget which Canada will publicly grant its first deficit for more than ten years, due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion", writes M. Breese.
There is no mention that the government had to renew Parliament's pre-warrant session so that it could not be defeated by coalitions and that the opposition parties made mention their survival through the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of an increasingly negative picture that the United States cast on the dramatic series sent to CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about the broadcast by Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not too sensibly links to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or kidnappings for the purposes of violent interviews with the CIA can be observed.
Another report reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe is ready to accept some prisoners with Guantánama.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but based on the principle of "case of the case".
At the end of the meeting, it says here, "is going forward some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, a state secret."
"The secret has accepted that the file will be revised."
Finally, let us note that those affected by WikiLeaks are sweaty.
Tom Flanagan, a former consultant very close to Stephen Harper, declared on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destructed".
Mike Huckabee, United States, also heard about it.
World Light Recovery Plan
The UN proposed a plan in Cancún to restore domestic lighting, lighting of shops and industrial space in 100 countries yesterday with a view to achieving a reduction of the greenhouse effect (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the further restrictions to be achieved for the planet's climate stabilization from now on until 2020.
This ambitious plan is located at the stage of the major specific projects that the United Nations wants to impose in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult to implement commitments to reduce on the part of industrially developed countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if the hot bulbs that are monopolisping still 50 to 70% of the market, we will replace the fluocombat light bulbs or, even better, the electric light bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet due to lighting would have been destroyed.
The light is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It's equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the car park across the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada have engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should allow a fall in global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will need to be subtracted from this balance by 5 Gt to reach the 2nd-degree stability of climate heating by 2020, so that it can be ruled out that it will not get out of control.
In heated bulbs 95% energy is scattered in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluo-compatible light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL bulbs, we will reduce this consumption twice.
Fluocomple bulbs will last from 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
The new DEL bulbs, which Philips has put into production this week - have reportedly participated in the UN study - have a estimated life of 25,000 hours and are using 80% less energy than a hot bulb, which gives us an idea of a possible reaction with a refund plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new lightbulbs can also work with resistors and emit less heat.
And there's no mercury.
Several experts expressed reservations against fluo-compatible bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, as manufacturers would set up collection.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluo-compatible light bulb, but rather a heat coal power plant, which allows many mercury needed to produce electricity frozen in hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these centres put 25 000 tons of mercury into circulation each year.
The report also provides in detail the profits that each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save billions of dollars per year for electricity purchasing and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 heat plants, whose construction would cost 2.5 billion
The Ivory Coast is eagerly awaiting the results of electoral results.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast after the time limits laid down.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent electoral committee to complete its work and immediately announce the preliminary results, stressed the UN President's spokesperson."
"He asks all parties in Ivory Coast and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to abstain from any initiatives until the disclosure of provisional results."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the election commission let the earliest date - the Wednesday midnight - without publishing results, three days after Sunday's scrutin'.
About 40 minutes before President CEI's deadline on television confirmed that the Commission's "going at work" was able to report results.
On the Wednesdays of the world, the calls for CEI to finally declare the name of the winner of the second round, between leaving Laurent Gbagbo and a member of the opposition by Alassan Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on decommitment by the Constitutional Council for the 'suspension' vote in the north, administered by former rebels of the New Army (FN) from the failed state coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, president of the election campaign in Ivory Coast, confirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation of voters who practiced FN (New Army) in the north of the country were discouraged by the successor of the president of the Ivory Coast to vote.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Board looked at the complaint given by Gbagbo.
However, the opponents of President Gbagbo consider that the country's Supreme Court is not neutral because it is governed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who demented any connection with the former rebels, condemned the delay in the announcement of the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he suffered a loss and that he would file a complaint to the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from sending results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, which was ongoing on Sunday, was considered the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halfs for years.
The United Nations pointed out in the middle of the political fraction of the Ivory Coast that it could be done responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round on 31 October, as a winner with 38% of the votes against Alaskan Ouattaru, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in the third quarter of France.
The unemployment rate in France as defined in the International Labour Office (BIT) has remained stable to 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas), as shown by provisional data on the correction of seasonal deviations (CVS) published on Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed has settled at 2,631 million in the metropolitan area.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolitan area and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate is increased by 0.1 points.
In a wider picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France in the third quarter do not work, but would like to work regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work and whether they are looking for or not.
The situation of current young people on the labour market was still marked with a new increase in unemployment rate of 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0,9 points per three months, +0.5 points per year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people aged between 15 and 24 were, according to the International Labour Office.
As regards the seniors, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points per three months as well as per year), which is 482,000 people from 50 years of age and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only 25-49-year-old populations benefitted from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points per year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following the recommendation on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to develop monthly statistics and announced 9.8% for France (including DM) on Tuesday after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and put into custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the Chiefs of Waste Treatment and Brother PS Administrative Board Bouches-du-Rhône, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of a public procurement investigation, allegedly subdivided.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of abuse of the company's assets, abuse of public funds and public property, cover, provision of bribes, acceptance of bribes in order to affect the office and hold firearms, reports his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is fighting, and he insists on explaining to the judge all the questions that he intends to ask him and not some delusions."
"It is easy to follow him because of many punishable reasons, but another thing is to prove them," said AFP his lawyer, Florence Raul, before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini said through his attorneys that he sent a brief message to the judge before he was questioned to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also arrested and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but to ensure the operation of the dump he was supposed to handle.
As regards the allocation or destination of the funds associated with their functioning, he never knew of anything like that, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of Aubagne services, was charged on Wednesday for the abuse of public funds and a composite, and he left out free, under judicial supervision, a ban to meet, the protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client has been able to give explanations to all the facts that are unto him."
"The investigating judge looks into it and leaves it free," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more people were charged and released on Tuesday night on Wednesdays, with two of them being supervised by a state attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for the acceptance of bribes in order to influence the Office and for passive corruption".
Two Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuer are charged, one for the "discipline and abuse of the company's assets", the other for "comploit in the abuse of public funds".
Finally, a business associate of Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of hiding the property of the company.
Among those who have been confronted with Mr Guérini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in respect of Korsica.
The investigators suspect his society that they helped to launder money from large-scale mobsterism.
The investigation is carried out in several open court investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public contracts, in particular on waste.
From the source of close investigation, the search is focused mainly on the conditions of assignment and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the Marseille City Community (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: The Elysian Palace was driven by the Mediators of Syria
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotildy Reissová, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "spionage", united opinions in France, put diplomacy into a combat emergency and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this closely monitored diplomats from the United States.
The American documents, received through the WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde, reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to Americans and went so far as to advise them to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the leaders of the French authorities tried to convince Washington that the release of young French women was not compensation for release on the freedom of Majid Kakavanda, an Iranian prisoner in France and a sought-after American justice for the sublime trafficking of material in favour of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they submit to the sharp light the way the French Presidency was trying to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything for it.
The Diplomatic Telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the title: "Iran:French comments on how to solve in case of hostages".
The consultant at the Elysian Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by Director Quai d'Orsay for North Africa's Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks to the representative of American diplomat Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They recommend the Americans to do the same to bring them back to their own nationals by violence held in Iran.
"Do noise," they say, "extensively mention "in the media the words "the fundamental rights of man", "invincible," "free liberation".
It is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into trouble, sensitive to its image.
"Do it more, the more they ask you to stop it."
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, "tico can't solve anything," the Iranians are "masters on evasive maneuvers".
Mr. Richier points out that arresting foreigners is an "Iran family tactic: taking hostages for "political blackmail".
It announces that the release of Klotilda Reiss on 16 August, on the day on which it is granted refuge in the French embassy) "to request the payment of the high financial amount to the Iranians" (approx. EUR 230 000).
And he'll announce that the Elysian Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that'll "energise".
The Iranians could "in the future arrest more than 1,800 French living in Iran" states.
August 28, 2009.
Klotilda Reiss has left prison 12 days ago, but still remains blocked in Iran.
The information is spread: Iran’s Majid Kakavand, which the United States declares to have been released for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material in relation to Iran, is released for freedom in Paris on the basis of a judge’s decision.
As well as many observers, the U.S. embassies are asking about this disturbing consensus.
For Washington, following an illegal Iranian network to retrieve nuclear material, the dispersal of Majid Khakavanda is a bad news.
France proceeded to a convening?
Freeing Iran for the liberation of a young French woman?
In the next interview with Kathleen Allegrane, September 4, François Richier assures that it is not.
The Elysian Palace, as it states, was not only "surprising this decision," but looking for a way to stand up against it.
"There have been talks between the President's Office and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change its decision", notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "moze" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The consultant of the Elysian Palace dials a phone number, hangs up his phone headphones and then informs the American diplomat that Iran is currently in the buildings of the Iranian embassy in Paris."
At the time of the imprisonment of Klotilda Reiss in Iran, the Elysian Palace develops efforts, negotiates through the communication and organised "outs" into the media to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and "influence" role of "mediator".
Americans observe this activity not without irony and conclude that manipulation bears its fruit because several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evocates the media 'blest' of French officials.
As such a measure of gratitude is established against M. Assad, he asks the embassy in Paris.
"Although their declaration is full of praisers, French officials in private recognise that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done".
The document deals with the reasons that forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "is aimed at validating President Sarkozy's policy to open Syria", analyses.
Politics applied in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "as the Syrian role overwhelms", Paris is trying to "disarm Syria, which boasters can serve when it plays a constructive role in the area".
The goal is also to "seal the grain of the necrosity between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows it from a very good source.
On August 11th, François Richier said to him, "We obviously don't know if the Sisters have done anything, whatever it is."
"But yet we thanked them."
"That should at least bring confusion and ambiguity between Iran."
Klotilda Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts her at the Elysian Palace.
In communication, she thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the liberation of our country".
End online games after midnight for young Korea
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Peciwal" that will prohibit the adolescents from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, the responsible government officials.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December in order to ask the company operating online games to block access to these games after midnight to persons under 16 years of age, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of the Family.
"There are many children who play these games all night and then have problems teaching at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep" said for AFP Jo Rin, the Head of the Ministry, who has a bill of law in charge.
On-line games will be newly accessible from 6 am.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also assumes that it will ask the company to limit the daily time of access to these games for the young, whose parents are asking for this, to complement the responsible worker.
He also gives available to those who ask for this, free programs, allowing you to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "preserved" and daily press brings regular differences associated with the intensive use of the internet.
At the same time, the country is an undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea gained four golden medals on World Cyber Games, in the face of 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: Fifa establishes host countries.
Full unrest due to suspicion of corruption is established by the Executive Committee of Fifa on Thursday of the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a selection of politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risk overcoming technical criteria.
The issue is certain, Fif's Royal Competition in 2018 will be held in Europe , the traditional swamp of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 Championship will be much more exotic, while the International Federation hopes that it will be able to conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere in the African continent in 2010, or continue to be deployed to the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities involved in the delegation ( David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, Belgian government leaders and Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives you the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political betting around the world.
The discussion behind the scenes faces the risk that will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish hierarchy according to candidates.
According to Fifa's assessment report, the English, Spanish-portugal (2018) and American (2022) documents contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for 22 members of the Executive Commission at an hour to vote.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the discovery leading to the suspension of two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynalald Temaria et Amos Adamu) may have destroyed the chances of her country, the collages of the copy that so far hosted the world championship only once a year.
On Monday, the BBC imposed a crown when it sent out a document that "slept on pins" three powerful members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayata.
How to make Fifa restless and bring English leaders with David Cameron first in distress.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will be able to repeat the move that led to his predecessor as Tony Blair, who managed to acquire for London the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Will it be enough this intense activity to add new shine to England by its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the pair of Spain-Portugal do not miss the coffins of the already prepared stadiums, his benevolence (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the clouded economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any remuneration measures against the English and the doubts about the eligibility of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided not to move the Championship to Zurich and publicly declared "a certain competition in the preparation of the vote", in the words only barely covered by the accusations of the English press against CE members (European Commission).
"We're going to throw mud on them, we're going to try to compromise them," said Poutin.
For 2022 they seem to be a logical favorite of the United States with their considerable experience in 1994.
The world’s highest economy performance, the headquarters of Fif’s main sponsors, seems to have a great lead in front of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, produced a beautiful project.
But these candidatures seem to be premature for both countries, which together have undergone a "test" test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of World Championships 2026 to China, which is eager to Fifa, has made Asia's chances for 2022 invalid.
With Katar, who pulled out of the sleeve a large ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand into new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than sure.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for the chat fees of TV (due to time shift) paid by European countries, forming a momentum for Fifa.
Second mandate: public (certificate)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand woke up knowing he was weighting.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
The Mandate of the Elysian Palace calls someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But clearly, it is not in good agreement with the share of secrets associated with the Presidency's function.
It is therefore necessary to act as though doubt persists.
In one sense and in another.
In 2006, without wanting to believe, Jacques Chiraca's friends would claim that the third mandate would not be excluded.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy, with a serious expression, said that he would sometimes decide in the autumn of 2011.
As it recalls before the members of the UMP Parliament on Wednesday evening at the Elysian Palace, the perspective of two mandates has become less hot.
Was it the official announcement of his candidature?
He wasn't far from doing it.
The President only reminded that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 reduced the number of five-year terms of office for two.
It was from his side of the story, not the announcement.
It's not the first time he reminds us of such meetings as the humorous tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you still have seven and a half years ahead of me," he passed in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next stage."
His previous statement will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; he will not make him a candidate or less.
If they make comments, it's because of double truth.
It's getting fast to the candidacy to PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to the Ségolèna Royal collage that push Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
On the contrary, it is because his candidature in 2012 is evident that many in PS want to arrange for combat formations rather premature than intended.
Bad research on the other side.
First, voters of the right would prefer François Fillon's candidacy prior to Nicolas Sarkozy's candidature (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we do not discuss this matter with the UMP," they responded immediately and soberly people from the nearest vicinity of the Prime Minister.
"If he believes a possible defeat, he won't run", Jean-Pierre Raffarin reports.
"It will always believe that he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with the obvious.
Euro: Central European Bank forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of Centrals of the year should have been an opportunity to specify the conditions for exit from the crisis or, at least, to notify a large number of unusual monetary policy operations which must be terminated by the end of this year.
The crisis of the sovereign European claims binds, the securities issuing institute will undoubtedly not be able to afford so much categorical under the threat of deterioration of the situation already being so tight on European securities markets.
In such cases, the political price would be higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, the French Minister for Finance Christine Lagarde gave up a tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in favour of the resolution of the crisis of European sovereign debts.
She did not want to say whether she thought that the bank could have done more, for example by increasing their programme of purchase of sovereign bonds.
"I pay attention to my European partners..."
In the evening before, in Brussels, during his hearing of the committees for the European Parliament's economic and monetary affairs, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show up as much as possible in terms of his intentions and was satisfied with the fact that he said that the programme for purchasing state titles in the secondary market "go ahead" and that "we will see how we will decide" during the meeting held this Thursday.
One certainty: The Central European Bank will monitor its basic non-monetary interest rate of 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of bonds made by the Central European Bank have doubled to nearly €1.55 billion in the last week.
And thanks to the confusion of the agreeers on the market yesterday, new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds were made.
Overall, euro area central banks have purchased 67 billion euro from May 2010.
There are no doubts between the agreements on the market for anticipating purchases (see page 29).
Neither economists expect any significant change in course.
If a loan operation for more than three months has already disappeared from the European Central Bank's arsenal, the latter shall be appointed to the unlimited provision of liquid funds under generous conditions and for the duration of one week to three months.
The Economs are now expecting this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine she'd change her program in a significant way."
"If not, this would take the risk of a short-term tension," says Michael Schubert, the Commercialbank economist.
"The progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", says Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its public debt interventions, "that the European Central Bank have to maintain the volume of purchasing its bonds to reinvigorate the poor market", says Norbert Bräms.
Given the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, it has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"He needs to replace the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the discharge of paid performances by the States, which belong to the most fragile", said yesterday a significant bond manager.
Because if interest rates take off, the states will be more concerned about this to reduce their debt instead of stabilising it.
It's a rescue of the euro at this price.
In Italy, the Government of Berlusconi's proud back
After the beginning of the week for Italy a little slowed down the worrying situation, with a backflow of bond interest for 10 years yesterday.
Return to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for the Economy of the Regions, they said that they heard Giulia Tremonti, how he qualified the situation as "unsolvable" and that he was expecting an "unforeseeable" weekend, which he then demented.
In any case, on Tuesday, the derogation from the long German interest reached a record of 210 base points and the price of the bankruptcy cover (CDS) contracts went up to 263 points, which in Rome caused certain disruptions.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the derogation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said of himself that he was "too busy" "breeding market development" and a possible disease originating in Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stellar, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Right and not encrypted, its problem is the absence of growth and insignificant fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and puts the state at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is expected from now on to 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the government deficit will represent even 4.3% of the gross domestic product next year (compared to 3.9% of the projected government) and 3.5% in 2012 (place 2.7%).
From here on, a new summary of the additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new measures will have to be taken", evaluates the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The core stones of its economy are correct and its calculations are correct, we repeat it for a long time", assures Argigo Sadun, Italian member of the Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short-term nor long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of the Gross Domestic Product 2011, NDLR), the efforts to stabilise the required in Italy are smaller than efforts required from other countries", notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of OCDE.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion for distrust in the Chamber of Deputies and then they could start organising elections, with which at the end of March is counted.
This would open a period of little suitable for the adoption of a decision on the serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking of strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde stressed yesterday in the press conference in Paris: "I think that Europeans have demonstrated this on Sundays all day and night, they are obviously very solidarity-based, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although all relative, yesterday's expansion on interest in European state bonds brought water to the mills of governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about starting normalization.
The Standard & Poor's Notation Office has announced that it could degrade the Portugal debt record, the objectives that focus on various speculations most.
"Because in May, the economy of Exane BNP Paribas is an insufficiently transparent and obvious policy, consisting in particular of banking systems."
More so, "political time runs slower than market time".
They are aware of this interrupted relationship and the dangers that are hiding, making the European countries more intensive in their discussions, aiming at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultation between finance ministers, the most involved problem, and in the wider sense their G20 counterparts, is developing very well.
And that in the light of Eurogroup meetings (Eurocrupe) and Ecofin groups since the beginning of next week.
The European Central Bank meetings are held today.
The programme is the fate of conventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
With regard to the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, he closed on Tuesday in Singapore a trip to Asia with a view to informing investors from the Far East about the evolution of the crisis in Europe.
If it is not intended to increase funds, it is preparing land to achieve this objective.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected for next month.
Yesterday, the US official representative told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilised funds by additional direct involvement in FMI.
The countries concerned in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are being prepared to adopt structural reforms, particularly as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are linked to strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid are different from those used by Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid, at all costs, asking for international assistance before they apply their own budgetary corrections and rather than deciding on structural reforms necessary to regain lasting trust again.
The European funds capitalists are finally talking about options that are available to speed up the normalisation process of the markets with sovereign bonds.
On its way to Paris November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea that it would not cost EUR 750 billion of mobilised Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to touch the stock of securities again.
The Ecorooms of Barclay Capital, which is the entirely first business plan with European sovereign claims, consider that an addition of approximately EUR 100 billion would suffice, "rare" by direct granting financial liquidity.
There is: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which is €60 billion this day.
The Council, which has every chance to be tried in Europe's major cities.
Especially when market conditions deteriorated.
Snow and air: 24 regions have an orange emergency.
Snow rations still cause problems in transport, especially on the roadways of other classes in Brittany, and there is a risk that they will disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four periods have an orange emergency from now on due to the risk of snow and air.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Lair, Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, joined 20 periods of already declared orange emergency, 18 already from the mid afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde later on night.
According to Météo France, the significant floods of snow cause problems in the north of la Gironde and the Charentes forest and are weakly snowing on Ile-de-France.
The snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, seats 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the periods concerned and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the areas of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are reserved.
Snowflies are big enough to cause problems in transport and disrupt certain economic activities, predict Météo France.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some periods have prohibited the passage of heavy freight transport - to trucks over 7.5 tonnes with the Guingamp-Lannion route and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac route.
Road traffic on the road of the other classes in Brittany is very difficult according to police officers, and the police recommend driving with their vehicle only if it is really necessary and the operation of some cars was cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned for Thursdays in Picardia.
No special measures are to be taken on Wednesday evening to limit freight transport.
The District Authority calls on all drivers of cars to be as careful as possible on roads and to adjust the vehicle's nature.
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel their flights on Thursday 25% at Roissy Paris airport and 10% to Orly due to expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends passengers using air transport services to join their companies.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport is closed to the south of London and Edinburgh, Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport at Ile-de-France in full flow, it rains billions.
At least during the discussion.
We remind particularly 23 billion of the Grand Paris Metro, which is to build the Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to be launched, the State announced a subsidy of EUR 4 billion.
This is theoretically the amount which will then allow SGP to use part of funding for contracts from its dual source.
Today we are finally getting to the first supplements.
The 2010 Finance Act, which examines the financial committee of the National Assembly this morning, includes the mechanisms provided for in order to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special equipment tax and increasing the office tax on Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, Article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution of the Société du Grand Paris".
It is estimated: "The revenue from this interest is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the price for the offices already in existence, "to be upgraded to increase the yield obtained and to affect this increase by Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
I can't believe it.
That's not specified in the text.
We've got four billions away.
"It is clarified that these fiscal resources are linked to EUR 4 billion from the capital subsidies that will be mobilised by the State and inserted into the Société du Grand Paris project", we can read in explaining the reasons.
This system does not seem shocking to us at SGP.
"Since we have created revenue (taxes, ndlr), we can cover studies for three years and then smite up to 4 billion, explains here."
"This will be integrated into the budget and used as necessary."
The SGP considers that 4 billion will be assigned in 2013 to the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billions promised belong to the present subscribers, risk calling for a rather busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be December 7th.
Misty hackers, and they'll make the confessors
The WikiLeaks case has two double meanings.
On the one hand, there is an obvious scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal in the face of hypocrisy, which governs relations between states, citizens and press.
On the other hand, he talks about profound changes at international level, and he takes over the future under control of regression.
But let's do the right thing.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this is a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by a secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of printing cuts.
The American "motual revelation" about the way Berlusconi's sex life is told what everyone could read for months in any newspaper (all except the two Berlusconi's own), and the cartoon profile of Kadafí has been a long time for cabaret artists covered for sketches.
The rule, according to which secret documents can only consist of messages already known, is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to the bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that every work repeats (with Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templářích or Zednářích) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of the occult texts does not like to search for new information (not knowing where to look for reports about the non-existent), but because those who engage in occultism believe only what they already know and confirm what they have learned before.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same goes for secret documents.
An informant is lazy, and a lazy (or limited spirit) chief of secret services (and if he is not, he might be, as I know, editor in Libération's newspaper), who considers it true only of what he himself admits.
The high classified information on Berlusconi, which the US embassy sent to the State Department, was the same information that Newsweek had published a week earlier.
Why, then, did so much fuss around the discovery of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that embassy, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of the states can call or fly away to a shared dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation, have transformed into a spy center.
Any viewer watching films about the investigation knows very well that only from the lycometry seems to ignore it.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly, the shameful duty of hypocrisy, and it sheds bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can get the most strictly classified information on the world's most powerful country represents a hard hit, not an insignificant one, for the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victims and his "conventor."
But let's go from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell's times, it was possible to take over all the powers, like some Big Brother, who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been demonstrated since the ability to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, visited hotel, used highway and so on, has become a citizen of a complete sacrifice of power.
But when we demonstrate how it is now that even the graves with the secret information of the mighty cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes a runner.
Every citizen controls the power, but every citizen, or at least a hacker, elected as a citizen's avenger, can know all the secrets of power.
How can power remain that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that George Simmel said that the real secret is unobtrusive secrets (and unobtrusive secrets will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious secret, because it is derived from public life; but to reveal, like that WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were unsustainable secrets, means to take away all power from him.
WikiLeaks didn't make any mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something great to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound of so significant power?
Clearly, in the future, states will not be able to send on-line sensitive information - that would be equal to its publication on a poster mounted on the corner of the street.
But it is also absolutely clear that with current technologies it is unnecessary to hope that you can keep a secret message by phone.
There is nothing easier to determine whether and when the head of state traveled by plane and connected with some of its colleagues.
How will private and sensitive reports be preserved in the future ?
I know that for this moment my forecast belongs to science fiction and it is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials transporting discreetly filling the formality on non-controllable routes and carrying only reports that know or rather hide rare information in the shoe heel.
The information will be maintained in unique copies in drawers closed by the key: a total, attempt to spy in the Watergate affair had less success than the WikiLeaks.
I had a chance to write that technology is now moving forward with the side, which means backwards.
One century after the wireless telegraph meant revolution in communication, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Video tapes (analogs) have enabled movie lovers to see the movie step by step, move it forward and take it back and forth and reveal all the secrets of assembly while CD (number) now allow only jumping after chapters, that is, after macropors.
Through the speed train, we will reach Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the journey by plane and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is not exceptional, therefore, that politics and communication techniques will return to transporting horses.
One last comment.
Other times, the press tried to understand the secretity of the embassy.
Now it's the embassy that wants confidential information from the press.
Klima: how France hacked its promises for financing
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to try to keep the promises to rapidly unlocked funding (salted financing with a fast start (fast start) or prematurely implemented by developed countries.
And the great French hacks have been exposed
In Copenhagen, the developed country committed to providing $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised €2.2 billion for three years and France €1.26 billion (this is €420 million per year).
At the start of COP16, the EU has taken a big deal to convince its partners about the reality of its commitment to financing fast start: a report specifying the action of their Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation invaluable and valued: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that in 2010 it released EUR 2.2 billion, which brings it to the right path to comply with its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we find things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no match in what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, between others and France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses that reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered the 2009 reference: international funding has been preserved and it adds 150 million to it for three years to the start finance title.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment dates or with deadlines at the level of public development aid.
On the other hand, France considers that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of public aid for the development of d'Aide pubque au développement.
In particular, the total amount of aid to France towards developing countries may remain unaltered (or even reduced), to comply with its commitment to financing 'new and additional'....
Another decisive element is the distribution of donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that€ 1 loan is equal to €1.
Clearly it is difficult to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be added to some investments that are profitable (which are often projects associated with reducing emissions, consisting in more efficient technologies), the poor are presenting one euro, which we will get as equivalent to the euro that we provide... we should not understand it from the title of our liabilities, but as the price of the loan to the creditor country (i.e. the interest rate equivalent).
But France can only substantiate its commitment to EUR 420 million, making it 91.5% loan (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of the donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union which has been using the loan on such a scale.
Germany claimed 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (except for others) comply with their commitments with 100% of the gifts.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives 1€ on the basis of satisfaction of its promise, France will give only 10 cents and considers this effort to be comparable.
That's a beautiful little cobbler!
For the sum, France is operating in its financing of "fast start": on the one hand, the development of the stock in time and, on the other hand, with real financial burden.
Although it only issues EUR 36,1 million, it can convince that it issues EUR 420 million "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
Manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such a decision) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to donate when just lending?) and when negotiating, because developing countries are not totally naive...
The chapter of early funding is just a small lead, relatively short-term, in relation to the series of climate discussions.
But it could be a grain of sand in a huge outfit like UNFCCC.
Hopefully it won't be our case.
Whatever this is, it is essential to draw knowledge from this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its management of accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and integrity and justice with other European Union countries.
But above all, France should avoid discussions on deposits to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not avoid the question of 'accuracy' or the way of billing loans.
France should change its position to become progressive with these deposits as with others.
Thus, hopes all fit into the new Environment Minister, Mrs. Koscisko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
Surprising announcements on France's fast start and its vision of 'accuracy' and the use of loans could result in an increase in international confidence, necessary to continue in discussions.
The alarm on pesticides that the children will die.
The 10-year-old child will lose one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published on this centre, from the association Future generations (ex- Movement for the rights and maintenance of future generations).
The Association, which points out that its results " do not have a significant statistical value with regard to the low number of analysed samples, but are characteristic of the processed issue", bought between July and September food commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack for one child for approximately a 10-year-old in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as confectionery, were analyzed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance plate is crushing: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified among carcinogenic substances, possibly or likely, and five substances are among clear carcinogen substances, as well as 37 substances which could act as disruptive for glands with internal exchange (PE) according to studies of several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Even though in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical adopted individually are not exceeded, in our research we see that the reality in the exposure of consumers to contaminated substances, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is overwhelming", reports association.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain about ten résidoids with possible carcinogenic effects and three proved to be certain carcinogens, as well as some 20 residues that could interfere with the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, presented as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including, inter alia, France's prohibited fungicide.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, in which studies discovered traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, the biphet of minced meat, canned tuna, and even mushrooms and gum were dusted pesticides and other chemicals.
The water from the tap analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
The steak from salmon to dinner was "the richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to warm the food in the microwave oven did not avoid analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this 'contaminant compartment' is likely to be underestimated', results from a study.
The Ecological Europe-Green Society (EE-LV) proposed a 'form in the face of an emergency situation' to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop 'a growing civilizational diseases'.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the state of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which in cereal.
