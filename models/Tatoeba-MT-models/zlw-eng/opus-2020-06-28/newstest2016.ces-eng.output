On an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend.
During the call on the emergency line, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and needed them to come home.
Lamb said that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset, and that contacts on the family of a dead woman can be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss' body and handwritten a message on white office paper: "I am so sorry and wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she is the only one who ever loved me," was in a letter signed by the authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles on school campus where the police thought he shot Ethan Schmidt's favorite professor at the door of his office.
Police chief of Delta State University Lynn Buford said that the staff of the university heard shooting at 10:18 in the morning.
Lamb said he made a fatal call on the emergency line shortly afterwards.
Finally, there was another death; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after shooting at school, students and the faculty were forced to hide behind the locked doors, the authorities still trying to figure out what the Lamb's motivation was.
Details published by investigators on the side of the state and students and employees who knew him together created a picture of a talented, but probably a problem teacher.
Students confirmed they were looking forward to his lesson.
The Gautier police, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote in thanking the "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
Both were taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History together with 17 other faculty members and many students attended courses at both at one time.
At the same time, inclosures occurred as regards problems.
The student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, "like something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him he was facing stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had already asked Delta State University for a medical leave, when he said he had a problem.
And this year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate, on which Lamb worked hard, would not give him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
The President of the University, William LaForge, stated that he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamba was probably suffering."
Lamb won't answer these questions anymore.
After he left campus, the police intercepted his lead when Arkansas crossed the border back to Missippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with the only gun shot in the yard about a mile from his parents in the Greenville suburb of Mississippi, confirmed the Washington coroner, Methel Johnson.
He left the car started on the street.
It wasn't clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb has grown in this region.
Lamb started working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which is about 12000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught languages and hours of education.
In spring he received a doctorate in education.
One of Lamb's long-standing friends described him as a clever, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lambovi 20 when they met through joint friends.
She was with her friends at high school, and he was the great old guy who taught her a few years of playing guitar.
It was quite a heartbeat back then.
The heart of all the girls was seen as soon as he appeared," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss said they had some time together.
During an emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter now 19 years old.
"She was completely broken," O'Steen said about her daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Abigail and I built at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, random giants played together.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, barman and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, the savings of the lit bar near Gautier, said that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss at night 5th September, the sweat that Lamb finished on guitar and harmony for countless crowds.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We used to hurt each other and record each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, killed professor, conducted a seminar in the first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, professor of English at school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a boy student club and student government.
At Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, employees, students and community members, attended reminder events with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and Brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vialia, during which the university corps supported "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
On Wednesday, the school started again.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge claims.
The crisis is over.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story was modified to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a call on the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called his wife Prentiss, there was no evidence that they were actually reported.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us declares that they will not hire as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturer of children's toys and products claims to give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it was planning to hire around 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centres throughout the country, which is a fall compared to 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting candidates this month, and that the employees will receive employees within October until December.
While holidays on their own are far away for months, the shopping season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily accept employees for assistance in shops and sales, for sending and delivering goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about her date with Princess Diana
The Prime Minister "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable even for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theatre waiting for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would sit there," said the trailer for the coming document, "Back in time."
The movie starts and I realize I'm on track to something that could be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Return to the future," says Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemecki and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The Prime Minister "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is indeed the best travel document ever made for me."
"In time" will be available to VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russian accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader has again urgently called upon all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution.
Ban said at the Middle press conference that he was planning to meet the foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries - the USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the edge of the Ministerial Meeting at the end of this month due to the discussion of the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret at the fact that division in the Council and between Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unsolvable."
Ban invited five permanent members to express solidarity and unity which they showed when Iran’s nuclear agreement was reached in the resolution of the crisis in Syria.
8 electoral numbers that show Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to identify him as a person who often changes his mind.
Others over their hands like an unspeakable joke.
And some of them are getting ready for the implosion.
But whatever some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they're not doing it yet.
10 of the last 11 national polls show that Donald Trump is in charge of a double number, and some people are starting to seriously ask what that means for the nomination chances of this real estate magnate.
Of course, there is only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of 2011, Rick Perry's leadership made the way to rise to Herman Cain, eventually neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could run into general elections.
But outside groups like Super PAC Jeba Bush and the Economic Conservatory Club for Growth realize Trump's will to endure and start spending their dollars on a stand to throw it away.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that real estate magnate is not just a minor phase:
Trump's favourable rating turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in June June, it showed the vote Monmouth University that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnát.
That was 40 percent already in July.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a favourable view of Donald Trump.
Three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion on him.
And these numbers are held in the initial stages.
Following the election of the University of Quinnipiac, which took place last week, it was found that 60 percent of the Republicans had a positive opinion on Trumpa.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they would be either "excellent" or "consistection" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 reported that they would be "breathed" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said that they would be "excessed" against 40 percent who said the same thing about Trump).
Another closest in level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters argue that they would be "not satisfied" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush were to be a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his published and insulting, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationally inclined to think that real estate has a good temper for the post of the president, according to Monday's vote ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held in the Senator's club of the state of Iowa, which is the first in the country where 52 percent Republicans think he has the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independent people say that his temper does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to this idea.
When they put their student hats on, the Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
For a question of who most likely wins the GOP nomination, four of the 10 said that Trump would be the best choice, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
This is a change from late July when four out of 10 put their money in Jeba Bush.
Full publication: GOP voters had no clear crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the past cycle, 4 of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the candidature against 28 percent for Mitta Romney's event nomination.
Yet, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump as a credible campaign.
Even though the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump equally defeats almost everyone.
Some scholars stress that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is difusely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But the Monmouth University survey from the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical direct struggle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will receive almost always majority support.
He runs over Carly Fiorou by 13 points, Marc Rubie at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jebem Bush at 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie at 33 points at everyone.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead over a merchant at 19 points in a hypothetical match against one.
The Hola majority of Donald Trump’s followers claim to have already made their views.
The new CBS/NYT Tuesday survey shows that only more than half of Trump’s supporters claim to change their mind.
Clearly, it can change a lot of things, and no one can really say he would never change his mind.
46 percent states that they keep the back door open for a change between candidates.
Yet Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider colleagues, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion to be final, would go twice as likely to vote for Trumpa.
6 of the 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump about immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "roaders" in the announcement of his campaign with immigration still holds as the main and central theme of the 2016 conversation.
Some are afraid that Trump's publishedness is passing the key Hispanic voters away from the Republican party and the damage they seek rebranding.
But according to a new Monday's public survey of ABC/Post, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as immigration remains in the light of the headlamps, Donald Trump will stay as well.
Frustres from the government achieves new maximum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive about half of the support from Republican voters, especially due to their outdoor status.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new Monday vote ABC/Post say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
Des Moines Register/Bloomberg voted in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "not satisfied" and 21 percent "heavy angry."
The House supported a larger share of the State of coal levies.
The Czech Republic will gain more than 400 million.
At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the Government amendment to the upper law, which regulates the amount of the charge from the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised the Members that they would gain extra money from both the Treasury and the municipalities' budgets.
The message was criticised by opposition members who were afraid that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the village as well as before, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House supported the government amendment of the upper law at first reading, which means that the State should receive a larger share of the yield of fees from brown coal surface mining from mining companies.
The share of the State will be increased to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will fall from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The reference also changes the way in which the remuneration for minerals is calculated, which companies earn.
The change in neo-forest mining fees is expected to bring more than CZK 427 million into the Treasury than in 2013.
The government is expected to have a neutral impact on the revenue of municipalities budgets, because the fee is expected to be higher.
In the preceding year, the municipality received some CZK 450 million and a state budget of CZK 150 million from the fees.
From brown coal mining, about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns were spent.
The amendment also includes an increase in the remuneration from the loading area with 1000 crowns allowed for one hectare per year.
The income from these payments should continue to be fully mined by municipalities.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the Members that the municipalities would gain annually instead of CZK 14 million to CZK 100 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but it is determined by the government by its regulation.
The remuneration is now calculated as the sum of the amount of mineral produced and the rates for individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation is a reason for change.
However, Member of the ODS Marek Benda warned against the fact that setting up a fee by government regulation may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládka, in this case, the tax is not taxed because the state is charging the mineral, which is the property of the state.
Only municipalities whose territories are affected receive fees.
In the event of deep coal mining, they will receive three quarters of the money of the village and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will also be in the event of the mining of radioactive rock.
Part of the money that the State will collect from the mining charges will be targeted.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or in order to provide the rescue service.
The message was criticised by opposition Members who claimed in particular that it would harm the municipality affected by mining and land.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starost) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the communities as far as they have been, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget of the Minister of Finance," said David Kadner (Ustvit) elected in the U.S. region.
Ms KSČM Hana Aulick warned before the rise in unemployment in Mosteck.
Kadner and Aulický have failed to propose an amendment to reject, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government to work.
According to mining companies, the reason for the report does not reflect the increase in coal prices, because prices are made from more than 90 percent long-term.
The main consumers as power plants or heating plants should therefore not feel price growth.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the efforts to reduce their operating expenditure, which would in particular reduce the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to the latter, the increase in employment charges is reasonable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment to Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is crucial that Members, before the law is approved, know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government decision on coal mining limits.
If coal is used for limits, then it will have impact on profits for both the state and the foreign, it has highlighted.
Urban does not agree with Youth that the decision to break the limit below the Czechoslovak army should fall after 2020.
The limits at the bottom of the ČSA are expected to be broken down for reasons of social, economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Happy lead the Czechs as one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tenists appear at the Thursday draw of the Davis Cup in India on the board, and this time each one of them will probably hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans that, given the difficult conditions, he will spread the load on the entire quartet.
There is a heat and high humidity in Delhi, which is why heavy matches are expected, which can stretch to five hundred.
We need to take this into account.
I'd like to sort it out according to the weather.
And according to how it's going to look, he returned during today's training of Czech choice in the center of Raja Kumár Khánny.
With the number one team and the world's 40s, Jiří Veselý counts for both Friday and Sunday two games.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are likely to be a prognosis.
I want almost everyone involved.
I got it in my head, but I'm not gonna tell you yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech construction should be Stephen's participation in Saturday's four-game.
It's just a question of who's going to stand next to an experienced debivot who has 18:4 in Davis's Cup four-game balance.
It's probably not happy.
There are options for Rosol or Adam Pavlásek.
"I really don't know who and how it's going to look," said Navrátil.
It will decide according to the development of two-games.
Pavlásek can be a variant, and the Veselý surprised in the first round of the defeat in the deblem over Australians.
"He is decent to the debreath," he said.
I was successful against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to show the same performance I've shown from the second set.
"I'm happy for your experience, and I'd like to bring a point," said Pavlásek.
The home will be placed in two-her Yuki Bhambrio (125th ATP) in the ATP ranking), which won the challenger in Shanghai last week, where he defeated third and fourth-point players.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both challengers and our own experience from the ATP Tour, but we've convinced a lot of times that Davis Cup ladders don't decide.
"It decides the current form, the weather," said Navrátil.
Friday's initial two games start at 6:30 SELČ and can stretch because of the weather.
According to the predictions, it's raining, and the courts aren't under the roof.
However, he may play for artificial lighting, as well.
They've already ironed it, and it's got about two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be recorded under the lights," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ has been very excitedly expected
The new working manager Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time he will have to work with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions, shortly after noon, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and Members.
In a week's notice, he asked for "less theatre and more facts."
He also said he could skip a few sessions that he would leave with his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment into the shadow booth and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Leader to stand silent during the singing of the National Anthem in the service on Tuesday on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met criticism from a number of conservative Members and is at the center of attention to several stories on the headlines.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing national anthem has drawn attention
Mr. Corbyn's spokesperson said he'd be "sent in a respectable silence" and that he would recognize "the Lordship of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr. Corbyn's Shadow Department, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that the Labour Leader would recommend a national anthem "no matter" to sing "no matter" in his belief that the monarchy should be cancelled.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in the top of Mr. Corby's team, quoted differences in economics, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties initially supported him as leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that the political differences in work are also "maintenance" after Mr Corbyn's appointment through his position in the European Union and the government dose limit.
Mr Corby indicated at the TUC conference that the Labour Party submitted amended proposals to eliminate the whole concept of dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, said that the "very clear" party was undermining government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23.000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Works Party, facing David Cameron in the last decade since his election as the leader of the conservatives.
The leader of the working party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims to have ideas from the crowd for Mr Cameron's questions and received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims to be too confrontational and to refrain from both "responsible" and gross trade, and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, shadow business secrets, will represent him at PMQ if he does not participate — such as when Mr. Cameron is leaving abroad.
He also abandoned the idea of letting other colleagues stand up for him from time to time because he let himself hear that he had discussed the whole matter with the House spokesperson John Bercowe.
When Mr Cameron became the leader in 2005, he said he wanted to lean away from the politics style "Punch and Judy," which was often connected to PMQ, but several years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the judgment of leaders, their management of the House and their position among other MPs, although critics argued that they had become a caricature and need far-reaching reforms.
"Focence in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The Johannesburg Center is a difficult place to be homeless.
But one group of former street kids found a way to learn and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take photographs of their neighborhood and earn money.
The BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound rises while the wage growth in the UK accelerates
The pound came up with the following data and showed recovery of British wage growth, while FTSE 100 was carried out by means of a tender goal of SABMiller.
Between May and June, GB’s profits including bonuses increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
It was as fast as 2009 and it seemed as though the estimates were coming up when the rates would rise.
Sterling increased more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% above the euro to €1.33730.
FTSE 100 index concluded at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped by 20% after he got an approach offer from his rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine two of the world's largest breweries, and closer brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's stock was 0.9% above the encouraging news from the Rival Group of Richemont luxury goods.
The latest sales results of Richemont are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, started to rise again.
The shares in Glencore increased by 5% after the mining giant said they had risen by $2.5bn through shared placement as part of the debt reduction strategy.
The Mondi stock was the biggest drop on the index and decreased by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs reduced his rating to the company on the "sale".
JD Sports went up by 3.1% after the sports company announced a 83% jump in mid-year in the pre-tax accounts £46.6m
JD Sports says higher wages could harm expansion
The Executive President of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power outweighs the higher wage costs in his company, it states.
Costs could intervene with plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
The opponents of Prague apartment maršmelon are exaggerating.
Controversial construction's got a trace.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investments considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
Against the construction, which is to arise in close proximity to the Anežský monastery in the centre of Prague, there were also petitions in front of the Prague office.
The magistrate stated in the decision that there was a breach of the building law because all the elements of the territorial decision were not respected.
"The specific territorial decisions do not contain, for example, a type of land, a distance from adjacent buildings, a sufficiently clear and comprehensible shape of the building, the definition of the territory concerned by the influence of the construction," shall be written in its decision.
It is also considered illegal to believe that certain documents for decisions were issued on the basis of the original documentation that has changed.
This is, for example, an opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be created on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor has no valid consent.
However, according to file material, the owner of the land submitted only consent with project documentation for territorial proceedings, not consenting to the location of the construction on its lands, reports the Department of Construction.
According to Francesca August Razett, the branch of the construction order did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for the initiation of the review has already expired.
Anyway, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, complying with all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," said Razetto in the press release.
The project by people who, due to allegedly proposed façade color overlays maršmeloune, causes strong emotions in Prague.
In the city center, hundreds of people met in the past for protest against construction.
The association and residents close to the home are concerned that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inconsistencies of the buildings for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Anežian monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original format of the 2008 project, which was counted against the glass facade, was rejected in the light of the opinion of the National Memorial Institute (NPÚ) of the Ministry of Culture and cancelled the authorisation of Prague memorials in 2010.
The new project of Praga Progetti e Investments with windows for facial shape but the NPÚ and the Master's Memorials have been approved and a building permit has been issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the statements of opponents, said he never counted with the facade in pink color, which gave the project a nickname for pink and white sugar.
The Czech politician has brought the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On the way he took the crew to the car with three Syrian refugees, who said they wanted to drive about a half a kilometer.
In Hungary, according to him, it was not punishable, he claimed to the People's newspaper.
We knew that the law enforcement officers did not do such a thing.
But when the police stopped us, they arrested us to our surprise, and they took us to an investigation facility in Sheged, described the letter.
In the end, politics spent nine hours.
The police said they were correct, but the communications were no good because they did not speak very well English.
Incarceration, however, according to him, was tribular.
For example, in our goal about three times four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were distressed.
There was also a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people have been locked up there the next day, and because of the language barrier none of them knew what was going to happen to them, Berg said.
What's not to entertain anymore?
Ask the president of the Executor Chamber.
On Friday, 18.9., President of the Exektor Chamber of the Czech Republic will answer the questions of readers from 9:30.
You can ask her about changes to the Excise Act as from 1 September 2015 even to other items related to the expeditions or excursions.
Metcash launches a campaign in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA business from the support of Aldi in southern and Western Australia.
Metcash launches a campaign in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of over 120 shops in southern and Western Australia at the start of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brand using marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are added to brands such as Dunsborough based on the Simmo's ice creamer offering tastings in IGA shops and shop owners sell discount tickets on the Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when food, alcohol and hardware dealers celebrate their annual investment strategic day.
There is a lot at stake, because southern and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA's business steps and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Customers in southern and Western Australia are on-the-spot and IGA shops are enjoying a much stronger market share than in the NSW, Victoria and Queenland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern States.
Anyway, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will rely on 5 percent of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of the opening of the first trades they took from all existing players but mainly independent retailers.
This week in his report analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose USD 360 million on annual sales and Metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in southern Australia and 30 in the next year, and will generate sales of USD 500 and 600 million on individual markets.
Loss of food sales and volumes in the solid price base Metcash could cost it around USD 13 million on income before tax, confirmed by Mr Kierath.
At the same time Metcash lost its share in the markets in the Eastern States, especially Aldi and Coles, although the last survey of Roy Morgan found that the buyers in IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Hamish Douglas Fund, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said that business lunch in Melbourne could "probably disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglas's comment.
But it is known that a member of the Metcash Board contacted Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and Metcash’s trade incomes, which adds around 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of speculating changes, because sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesale has gone to counter-operated and they invest over USD 150 million per year to match the July prices in Coles and Woolworths at hundreds of products every week and thus help IGA retail refurbish trades by adding fast-growing food and news from private clients.
The executive director Metcash, Ian Morrice, claims that programs for comparing prices and making business take place and hopes that the wholesale will return to basic profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healym
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for her behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a collateral damage at a recent outreach around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves his manner of praise rather than criticism, reports President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented dua often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention to himself thanks to an afrerere with an unfamiliar Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinko on Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualification game at Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice separated the referee, Harrison then declared: "Wawrinka had to pull one to Kyrgios and I should have pulled him too."
While the last time he was seen smashing a rocket after he was stung by a cramp, Richard Gasquet's possible power at the U.S. Open, Kokkinakise was silently defending Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth about the location in the second two matches behind Bernard Romice in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I've been very intense about how Thanas was a bit involved in the dispute," says Healy.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost his cramp in the U.S., but he's not the first player to take his own anger out of his rocket because of frustration.
But he was in a very good position because he was exposed in the U.S. to a highly provocative circumstances because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves great recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, and he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, working very hard and he fits the team well and so, he has never had a problem with other players, in the wardrobe he is very respected, training hard, he is in a wonderful condition, he is a very stable and advanced young boy and I simply think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios because of an important match that starts on Friday, and notes that "morning decisions" is the right solution for all, but supports the native of Canberry to return to the team as a long-term centurion.
"First of all, we want our team to be totally focused on the match and not on all the controversy that arose around him." Healy says.
And I think that Nick rose very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, in the public's eyes are growing rapidly, he's also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, and we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time outside of the audience when he can think about it, is the best solution for the team, and also for him himself.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders and holds migrants
Following notification of the threat of Hungary on Tuesday, it closed its southern border with Serbia and stopped those who tried to make it illegal to stop the arrival of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants became involved in the country and Serbian authorities reacted in a grievous way.
Those who have stuck to the unknown time on the ground between two states stand by those fleeing violence in their home countries building tents and housing.
But there's a feeling of frustration.
When the helicopter flies over them, the migrants together call "Open Borders!" and they broadcast the orderly units of the Hungarian police.
Some in protest refuse food and water.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declares that it was "unacceptable" to send refugees back from Hungary, while more and more comes from Macedonia and Greece.
(Srbland) wants to be a part of the solution, not just an indirect injury.
In the next day, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic says.
The concerns at the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the 28 States block came with a united immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and talked to hope to reach an evental agreement for another month or by the end of the year, which the EU nations would accept more than 120 000 other refugees, including Hungary.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday for a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, did not lean on Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday, the threat situation in two southern regions gave authorities greater authority to solve the crisis and allowed them to close the road and speed up the case for asylum.
Meanwhile, the Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijarto said that his country is also planning to build fences from a barbed wire along the border with Romania to stop refugees who are trying to cross over their country when it is now finished fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News Coreponent Charlie D'Agata announced that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped to draw a barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point for refugees in the European Union, many of whom have escaped Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, the Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not war refugees looking for protection, which is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalise the violation of a four-metre fence that the government has built on the southern border with Serbia, and it also sets longer time-limits in prison for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares a threat," said the reporters spokesperson of the Government Zoltan Kovacs in the southern town of Sheged.
In this we have quite clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, the Parliament must continue to approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but reporters of the Associated Press at the border have observed heavy-armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, a home defense counselor, said that the authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border, and 15 had already been caught in the territory of the state.
They penetrated the fence with damage, and now in police custody they are accused of committing violations under the new laws.
The authorities quickly got the fence fixed.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday mornings after using a tow truck covered by a barbed wire.
At the main border crossing of Roszke there was chaos because the Hungarians opened an office in a small metal container for processing and the removal of people.
There were about 20 of them in, but thousands left behind.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton Neck before Bernie Sanders decreased by half in the national vote
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit lead at the Democratic Race at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up on her lead.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of democratic primary voters (glass 58 percent) while Sanders is second with 27 percent (per 17 percent increase).
The vice president Joe Biden, who is to tell if he wants to become president, is receiving support from 15 percent of democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the opening of the main competition, the most democratic voters argue that it is too soon to say that there are clear decisions which the candidate will support.
But the Clinton sponsors are more confident of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton lost land under her feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few.
Clinton keeps a big head start between women and relieves her guidance, but her guidance narrows down.
Her support between men fell significantly and Sanders lost only 5 points to her.
The benefit of Clinton with democratic voters under 50 has disappeared and is now equal to Sanders.
Clinton's still in a lot of lead with older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double head start in front of Sanders between liberals, but Sanders is now losing only 5 points in this group.
About half the democratic primary voters throughout the country say she'd be thrilled to be supporting Clinton if she'd become a party candidate.
The quarter would support it with certain reservations, and another 15 percent would support it only for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
I don't suppose it's a surprise that the Clintons are currently incompetence because of it, especially inflamation.
The views are mixed among those currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would be very happy to support her.
While 48 percent of democratic primary voters say they'd be thrilled to support Clinton, the less Republican voters say the same thing about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in the open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), it follows that there is time for her to be president of a woman (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
There is also a great option to choose and match problems.
While the Vice President is considering a potential candidate for the President, 57 percent of democratic primary voters would like to face-thirds of it, he thinks he should not run.
When primary democratic voters were asked who would choose as the second election for the nomination of the party, Biden is the most common option.
Clinton's supporters reported more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democrats' nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will spread from 20 points when Biden candidates to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win in general elections; but this figure fell from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is the second one on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be elected is increasing.
However, when the question of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems before the greater chance of election.
Like last month, neither one democratic candidate nor a potential candidate acts as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics between the primary voters of their parties.
Most of them see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and credible, and they think they have strong leadership quality.
Biden of all three leads to honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of democratic primary voters don't think that Clinton is honest and credible, so twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent of him doesn't have that opinion.
Primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are consistent with their ideological view.
With regard to all these standards, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
How questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as state secrets continue, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with the explanation of this matter and they say that their overall view did not affect it at all.
But it's a whole different story between the American public.
Half the Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third is satisfied.
The public's views on this topic were distributed in March, shortly after the problem came out.
Most Americans claim that this email controversy has no influence on their overall opinion on Clinton, while 36 percent of their opinion on Clinton worsened.
It is mainly the Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their view of Clinton deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and credible among the voters of her party, this question is still a problem between registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and credible, which is a decline by eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and credible.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also see Trump as honest and trusted.
However, Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush were best led.
Sanders see more people as honest as it is, but, like Carson's, a lot of voters didn't think of him.
The error spread of sample 351 of primary democratic voters is 6 percent of points.
Ben Carson ended up with Donald Trump in the national elections
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates are responsible for half the voters in the latest survey and others are seeking support.
The voters from all over the country continue to support Trumpa by the overwhelming majority, and they climbed out of 23% of support in the latest CBS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month, at 27% on Tuesday.
But in the same period, Carson fired 6 to 23%.
The research also found that Carson runs well across demographic groups, and tells Trump among the University educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor of the state of Ohio John Kasiche, is behind together with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, entirely on the run from 10% of the support fell to a current 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in third place with 6%.
The error spread of the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson improved and reached 19% of the support between the Republicans for Trump 32% of the support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
During Carson's rising trend, Trump decided to shoot down a neurosurgeon in service, and even Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five brotherhood members were accused of the death of a student of Baruch College's first year
Almost two years after the student died during the overloading brotherly ritual at Pocono Mountain, Pennsylvania, she was accused of murder against five people.
Brotherhood members of New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michaela" Denga during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and delayed him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, told the police.
Police report that he had blindfolded, had a bag full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the target over the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches and then fell unconscious.
Members of Pi Delta Dogs' fraternity did not call 911 immediately after Deng passed out, and they allegedly waited an hour before they took him to the hospital, say the police.
However, they found time to change Dengovy's dress, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Menga, the national president of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, put a police chief Chris Vagner at a press conference.
"At this moment the members began to hide the equipment and basically preferred the welfare of brotherhood before Michael Denga," said Wagner.
He didn't get back to life and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck with blunt subjection into the head, hull, and thighs.
"A lot of families have been lost as a result of Brotherhood overload and at least one student is dying every year for overloading since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, lawyer representing Dengov's family, in his statement.
Brotherhood and their members must be responsible and this step is important by the authorities.
The grand jury of Monroe County recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Menga, will also be charged with assaulting harassment and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only interested persons, but if there is an organization that approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will also bless them for responsibility," Wagner said Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned brotherhood and national brotherhood to cancel its relationship with local branches.
This will happen if Fed raises interest rates
The growth of rates will come and the bull market will stumble, the yields of bonds will rise and the economy will fall into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it takes and how long it takes.
In particular, the economy offers the history of a small timing producer.
Recession came 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggression of the Federal Reserve system in increasing rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rates rise, but rather the trajectory, as long as normalisation will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, the market members can make sure that all the fuss due to the speed increase can be exaggerated.
"The first increase of Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as the end of the era of 'lev money'," said Julian Jessop, head of the global economy Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more common but still low, to create a seismic shock that many might be afraid of.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a view of how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen in the last about a month, the expected increase in rates can make the air a little constant.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There appears to be a trend for the cessation of shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in the recent study of what would happen after the increase of Fed.
More specifically, the market in the last about 35 years often most - about 14 percent - is heading to an increase in the relatively flat in 250 days (mean increase of 2.6 percent), and then again returns to normal status after 500 days, with an average yield from the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to the recent analysis by Bob Doll, the main share loss of Nuveen Asset Management published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on shares tended to become more significant later in the tariff increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but the increase in rates often help her.
At present, Fed is facing some of the conditions that have not yet existed and which could accelerate recession.
Most remarkable is that the gross domestic product near its lowest point in history when increasing Fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, only twice the nominal annual GDP increase was below 4,5 percent during 118 tariff increases since 1950.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 percent, few people expected to maintain it while in the third quarter it was at only 1.5 percent, reports Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates in this difficult economic background could be risky and might arise a question, "this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants have been ready to grow Fed all year round, and all eyes have turned to a meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, future trade indicates only 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all elevating cycles have been in the super cycle to increase the leverage with GDP covering the tops of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning recovery," says the report.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is far from the longest of those who have waited since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, now we have been at 74 months and continue.
The firm yield was also callable as the market expects an increase in tariffs and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is faster evident in bonds than in shares when Fed changes policy direction.
In the case of bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first coming of the cycle increase/decrease.
At the end of the cycle, the yields of bonds fall immediately," Deutsche said.
The Stratégové Charles Schwaba believe that the increase in rates will cause an approximation of revenues between long- and short-date bonds, which equals the curve.
The high-income debt often works better in this climate, although "we are still careful to make a return," said Kathy Jones, in her analysis, a firm analyst for fixed income in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adapted to Fed's expectations of policy.
"There are several signs that the market has contributed to the prospects of more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is larger, the credit margin has spread and the volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens up policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the US are winning after rising interest rates and local products become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be much worse, because the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market area and their debt will also be greater.
"The history shows that "value" shares tend to overcome within three months of the initial increase in rates," said the analysts Goldman Sachsve in the client report.
Enterprises with strong balance sheets predominated the weak balance sheet companies in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
High-income companies, as well as low-volatile stocks, have also exceeded their average of 4 (per cent points), and 3 (per cent points).
The debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of mobile interest rates will lose most, said Goldman.
Despite purely stock games, consumers also benefit from a growing dollar.
People can see their profits also through higher yields, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, claims Member Andrew Bingham
Konzervative Member Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "glowing"
He considers that he is increasingly more and more indiscriminate from his commercial rival
He's also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on the British.
Member's colleague Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says neither is the original idea.
The BBC Radio 3 is "change" in Classic FM, claims the leading MP and builds fresh pressure on the broadcast to prove that they are doing something that they do not do commercial broadcasting.
Konservative Member Andrew Bingham also told the CEOs that public service radio stations seem to be "gloped" and become increasingly unrecognizable from their business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "hattered" - but it seems to change to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards that began last year seem to be British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that think of me, when you actually only imitate what we already have on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC has rejected the plea that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his business opponent in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 would not learn from any other radio.
And their commitment to live by music and creating music is actually at the top level.
"I think Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before because the British are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element for the production of the BBC, which came under fire due to the footing to commercial competitors during the transmission of Culture, Media and Sport, and they got to the hearing of the Commission.
Konzervative Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that the BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media at the estimated price of £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is discussed as a non-original and very different one?
Lord Hall insisted that the show BBC1 - in which the stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - were produced "a style typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to find a hit from its own stables when he started a fun series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of several future series of The Voice or spending money on license fees on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing by the slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be guilty
The first three months of 2015 recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month the lowest growth has been recorded since the year 2000 the records themselves began
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for losing spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, and it has made many British major streets a city of ghosts.
However, experts claim that there are signs of stopping online sales, and new figures show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth from the early 2000s alone, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts claim that signs of post-market termination occur and new figures show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at growth levels over the past years and go back to 2000, you always rationalize yourself in time," says Guardian Andy Mulcahy, IMRG index editor.
It explains that Internet sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to realize purchases in different contexts, such as the couch.
But now (growing) is a bit stagnant, and therefore it seems to flow away.
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which was taken from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the decrease in sales.
Experts believe that customers could keep their purchases from this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average of the buyers turned to their computers to arrange their purchases and throw down several sales websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which the buyers are renegotiating, can retain customers from other purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was lost online.
For certain products, such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of sales are done via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of buying in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the fall of the crane in Mecca and the family Bin Laden was punished
Body 29 dead were transferred by the streets of Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly throws the blame for the collapse of Saudi Billadin Group's design magnate.
The Health Department stated that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane fall in the Grand Mosque in Mecca. The bodies of the victims were carried down the street.
Dressed up to a certain extent in white, mourners chose the way and gave up respect to the victims when the first fallen came on his final journey to Al-Moaiss cemetery.
The sad news was passing around the holy place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and cast himself into the believers.
The body was released for the funeral and the Saudi king punished the construction group of the family bin Laden over the disaster that also left 394 injured.
Body 29 dead after the fall of the crane in the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried by the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first bond when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the launch of the annual hose bond.
Saudi officials have already promised that the serpent will take place in Mecca, and thousands of people continue to enter the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group shouldn't have left the arm of the crane upstairs when it wasn't in operation.
The Arab version of the Decree, held by the State operated by the Saudi press agency, states that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the fall.
The English Disk Agency did not report this detail, but indicated that the company's bosses were forbidden to travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane to the courtyard of the Great mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims corroborate from the wilderness of Hadž later this month.
Binladin Group did not release any statement on the crane collapse and its representatives were not given a commentary.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of not using the most recent security measures, and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
The tens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive building effort headed by Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been near the Saudi government of the family for decades and are running major construction projects.
A late leader of the Al-Qaeda Osama bin Laden was the son of apostate who was rejected by the family in the 1990s.
The crash became in the middle of a strong wind and rain just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on a pilgrimage that at least once in life must be attended by every powerful Muslim.
Officials say 158 people still remain in the hospital.
Officials have identified that one million riyals will be devoted to the related victims and the same amount for the permanently injured.
The other wounds will receive half of this amount.

If you're good with a hammer or painting brush, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out Kutilian work at their home, according to the head of society as Screwfix B&Q.
Veronica Laura, the new Executive Director of Kingfisher, who owns the chain for domestic needs, claims that a large increase in the number of East European merchants offering the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at traders, closing 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laura says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores, because eight out of ten shopping decisions make better half of them.
At present most male workers are male workers.
She said that there is a need to address growing demographic trends that depict more female households that make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says, "Most men work in business with us.
We need to approach the balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women who make 80% of their purchase decisions.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms Laura, who is one of only five women at the corporate headquarters according to the British FTSE100, also reorganized her top team to reflect equivalence between the director of men and women.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in the fact that he has half the representation of women among employees, including executive and financial director.
Mrs Laura says, "It was a conscious decision - the diversity is an important topic.
So it wasn't difficult to find the good women we'd take with us.
Kingfisher announced how to profit in the middle of the year and sell after the group took the cost of closing business.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The financial contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It is justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of merit.
The President of the ODS Zbyněk Stanjura noted that the one-off contribution sounds good, but it would be better in the long term to be in standard valorization, because it would have been reflected in the next years.
"We have room to find the mechanism we will arrange," Stanjura said.
He supported the initial proposal by Minister Michaely Marks (ČSSD), which was meant to be valorized over the law next year.
Marks argued that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she thought was not pink.
The higher valorization of next year would mean the budgetary impact of 5,5 billion crowns and ministers debate every stamillion.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the pace of valorization has declined.
Report Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal did not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
In this right of payment in December significantly complicates and possibly even deteriorating, he said.
The chairman of the ČSSD MPs Roman Sklenák therefore proposed to shorten the deadline for discussing the standard within the Committee for 10 or 20 days, even the right has blocked it.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
Bonus should reach a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
Money is intended to go mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions should grow on average by about 100 crowns.
The contribution should be paid according to the pension amendment of the people who will be entitled to a pension in December or part of it.
Even those who lost their pension rights before they paid them could receive it in December.
However, they would have to request a supplement in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
In the Czech Republic, incomes are regularly valid for January, namely price growth and a third of real wages growth.
This year's salary corresponds to a salary of 41.5 percent of the gross wage, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent CZK 314.7 billion on retirement pensions last year, which was about five billion a year.
The old-age pension expenditure represented 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all expenditure required by the law.
The average old-age pension increased according to data in the state final account by 104 to CZK 10.714.
The Czech social security administration provided a payment of 2.4 million full of old-age pensions and about 17.000 retirement pensions.
Jakuni has left his plans for a political career, he will be dedicated to science.
The Senate seat was so certain by the Russian media.
In the Council, the Federation was to represent the Western Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov as a candidate of government, the Single Russia, in Sunday elections with an overview.
According to the Russian law, senators don't vote for citizens, but they're chosen by a governor from a threesome of candidates whose names they notify before the governor's elections.
Then after the election, the senator will choose three candidates himself.
Jakun's complicit was the fact that he hadn't lived in the Kaliningrad area for 20 years as required by the law.
Although the Kremlin found an exception to Jake, he is an exceptional and competent ambassador not subject to a legal requirement for long-term residence.
The filming of Czech comedy Theory Tiger.
The last drop in the resolution of the main hero is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has suffered strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janžur made a decision on her grandfather's life, age and funeral.
John is clear that he is on a similar path with his wife Olga - Eliška Balzer.
He will remember that he once had his own will and dreams, and he wants to live with dignity and freedom.
They desire to regain their control over their lives - and as a solution they choose escape from the present, he said to the story of Slavik.
Bajgar wanted a comedy form to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of his partners didn't feel completely free.
He said it was clear from the beginning that Bartošek, who had already worked with him on the Invisible series.
Yet, the actor who appeared in front of the camera after a longer break connected with the reconvalence after a serious illness surprised him.
We made a deal three years ago.
I gave him the script, and he said he liked how sad he is.
And I'm surprised he's probably a kooky athlete.
He used to ask questions about where he would sit before making another scene.
This time he was riding a bike, climbing rocks, and even walking down a hill.
And that in record tropical heat, he made a note of the director.
According to Bartošek, women take a tiger to make a rabbit out of him.
They're gonna stick some feed on him, but they're gonna close the door so he doesn't think he'll be playing outside the rabbit truck on a tiger.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie, commenting on the actor.
His wife, who can act slightly negatively on the audience, represented Eliška Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic, and she thinks well.
But at the same time, she's a dresser, and she wants to make her husband sick to death, and he said Bajgar.
The film depicts also the fates of Jan's married daughters Olina and Alenka - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavel Beretová - and the teeth of Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film manufacturer is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-productions Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google’s American Internet Company promised to provide more than $5 million (US$132.6 million) to organisations that help thousands of refugees streaming to Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday, Google.org, a charity post of this website company.
Azerbaijan repealed Telič's part of the visit for criticism of human rights violations.
The Czech Member of the European Parliament for the movement ANO Pavel Telička put the fourth trip to Baku, because the authorities of the Observatorie today canceled the official part of the visit.
This is based on Telka’s argument that the EP resolution last week, which criticises human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Telička co-authored.
By deciding on the Hungarian side, Telička lost the possibility of interviews with the official partners, as well as the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, explained in the press release of his Brussels office.
The trip planned a few months earlier, Telička wanted to use the text sent by the ČTK to meet Parliament's leadership and representatives of the exhibition with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners.
EP resolution condemns "unforeseeable repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
She called on the European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officers and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after the recent judgment on the babodian opposition journalist Chadjí Ismail, who had agreed to expose corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out that it will build an air base in Syria.
Bogdanoviani did not rule out when he visited Novosibirsk that in the future the Russian air base in Syria would emerge.
We don't have such plans yet.
But nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia has already a flight base in Syria at the port of Tartus, which has been used more so far as a service and logistics center.
According to reports from the Russian press, Russian weapons and military material have been rising to Syria since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow, weapons shipments resulting from the trade agreements in force are concerned.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to set up an air base near Latakíja, which for the time being remains the bast of Syrian President Bashar Asad.
But Washington does not have a clear understanding of the specific military intentions of Russia in Syria, that match the American commentators.
The US Foreign Minister John Kerry spoke on Tuesday with his colleague Sergei Lavrov, for their third phone interview in the last ten days.
Next week, in Moscow, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be released to translate his concern over the gathering of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The White House spokesperson Josh Earnest named Asad's support from Moscow for the lost bet.
Russia’s policy objectives in Syria declared that they were rather unclear.
Moscow, according to him, made Syria its satellite.
This may mean that President Vladimir Putin is more of a long-term target, but what does Earnest say is not quite clear.
The war in Syria is expected to be the main theme of Putin's speech at the UN General Assembly meeting in New York today.
On the other hand, the situation in Donbas in Ukraine is wrong for Russian leaders to speak at all.
According to today's newspaper The New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out that President Barack Obama and the Russian President could meet during the UN meeting.
However, the opinions between White House advisers have been disintegrating so far.
The TASS Agency wrote today with reference to the words of Cremel spokesperson Dmitry Peskov that Putin had no meeting with Obama on the programme of her New York residence.
Set sesame oil on a gallbladder diet, the hemp helps strengthen immunity.
The use of extra virgin oils is a good way to increase the intake of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these crops.
When pressing from seeds for cold, they will remain in the oil of all healthy substances.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of a health diet, such as gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
The Czech Institute of Health Information and Statistics has been the most common reason for the death of Czechs for several years.
Yellow inflammation suffers mainly from women, helps sesame oil.
If you belong to Asian cuisine, you must not miss a sesame oil that is part of the original recipe for exotic food.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used for heat treatment of dishes and has a number of favourable health effects.
It is often used on a gallbladder diet.
Essential fatty acids that contain are good for the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% cause of gallbladder inflammations and women suffer 3 times more from these difficulties than men.
In general, the problems with gallbladder relate mainly to overweight people who do not export and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be used with a liver diet that is very similar to that gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits brought by the consumption of this oil, they should be careful about goods from exotic foods.
Asian producers often use broken seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
But the oil will lose all the active substances, described Ladislav Hačecký, CEO of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokollovsk, who produces bio virgin oil pressed for cold.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unladen seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our fox will be able to drain eight kilos of sesame.
The mechanical pressing of the raw material shall be warmed up to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for the extra virgin marking.
A loss of nutrients would occur at higher temperatures.
Sunflower oil is beneficial in heart diseases and blood vessels.
The Czech favourite among oils is sunflower.
From Jarmila Hamer's research conducted at Masaryk University, 43% of respondents preferred him in warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, starting at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, for the seasoning of salads and especially in diet, in which it helps prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of Omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which reduces cholesterol most from all fatty acids.
In heart problems, attention should be paid to the amount of total accepted fat and calories.
For example, there are 62 calories in one spoon of sunflower oil, 99 calories in the spoon of rapeseed oil.
As regards the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more appropriate than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
It is therefore appropriate to touch on extra virgin oils.
The sunflower lasts just like the sesame and hemp for nine months.
In the fridge, durability will be extended even further.
Old oil people get to know especially according to bitter taste.
On the contrary, it is not a fault.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
The cannabis oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of hemp are classified as superfood, and therefore hemp oil is considered the most healthy of vegetable oils.
This label gives the highest content of omega 3 and the Omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids can't produce the body on their own and you have to take them out of food.
Omega intake of 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
A study of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece conjure her 0.6 grams, on the contrary, the Icelandics take 2,5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
It is appropriate to include cannabis oil in the diet as part of a support diet to strengthen immunity and to heal the injury.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People don't have to worry about the use of hemp oil, they don't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms the fact that Bohemia Oil is one of the best sellers in the company.
500 liters will be sold annually.
People often use one spoon fast by morning.
The cannabis oil is not tasteful, but excellently strengthens immunity, advised Daniel Vlček of the crystal company Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, Americans are the most precious people of barbecues.
There's 1.4 grills for one household.
There are various grilling contests throughout the world that confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs in the back.
On the basis of consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in their lives did not compete.
The vast majority then grill even several times a year.
To make barbecue successful, we must not underestimate preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating several hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is the most suitable for this while grilling leaves healthy beneficial substances?
Generally, during the grilling process itself, fat should be saved.
Experts agree that much of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oil then comes the body of beneficial substances, which we otherwise obtain from the consumption of food oils modified at lower temperatures.
But it doesn't mean that extra virgin grilling oil won't find their use.
Pea oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When you say meat, grape oil is immediately removed from the company Bohemia Oil in Sokolovsk.
The taste of meat and fish is wonderfully added.
In the kitchen, it is characterized by unique features to increase the natural taste of food.
Also suitable for frying and grilling because it has a high level of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, as one of the few oils preserves the health of the beneficial substance, describes the advantages of the grapes oil Daniel Vlkek from the company Bohemia Oil, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this vine oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
In addition, it contains high amounts of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating the excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favorable content of these substances helps reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
Consuming grape oil we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves skin elasticity, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and flammable hair.
The chefs commend the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example when seasoning salads, but also for heat treatment of dishes.
So you can use two ways for barbecue, marinating and barbecue alone.
By marinating meat and fish, we will maintain their juicyness.
There must be three ingredients present in the preparation of marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
We add acidity, for example, with apple vinegar, and we achieve a softening of the flesh.
The chicken supplies the meat of flavor and the oil preserved and supplies the right rod, advises Daniel Vlček.
It also adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils it can pass through dark meat.
So the marinated meat or fish are prepared to grill, how do they proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by just a few drops to prepare food.
The same applies to barbecues.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method.
This mainly applies to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Shake oil oil from the grill itself, thus preventing the burning of food.
The preparation of the annexes is also an essential part of the barbecue.
For grilled meat and fish, practically anything - grilled vegetables, cooked bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
The chefs of Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, hot summer salad.
To him you need: • 1 piece of peaches • 1 bundle of rubella • 1 cup of sliced cucumber • 1 cup of salad leaves • 3 soup spoons of grape oil
Add the salad bowl to a mix of salad leaves to the round, sliced cucumbers and to the large cubes sliced peach.
According to the taste of osolate and opete, you can also taste ground chili and soy sauce.
Finally, bathe a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can then put the salad on gently cut almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it doesn't only affect medication, but also the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and one with this diagnosis needs care of a number of experts: neurologist, physiotherapy, ergotherapeutic, urologist, otalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example women with multiple sclerosis need consultation if they decide to have a child, social law advice, housing recommendations, etc.
However, all this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient itself.
The more actively fighting the disease, the longer it can work and it doesn't need to change the way it lives.
As doctors point out, the passiveity of the sick releases the area for the activity of the disease.
For example, it is proved that regular movements are quite far from the time when a patient needs some compensatory aid, such as a stick.
It is important for patients and their surroundings not to be subject to different myths, such as that disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
This is why we have a page Give a chance (www.bezmyt.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign.
The most important person in the care of sick with multiple sclerosis is neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, twice the saying that the disease starts to heal earlier, the doctor may rather influence something.
It's because we have multiple sclerosis medicine in the inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not yet so strong.
The sooner we get hit, the greater the hope that we can stop the disease and delay the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from Neurological Clinics of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important in people with multiple sclerosis of rehabilitation care, which most often solves lower limbs and balance disorders.
Patients are working according to their individual needs: to maintain condition, to improve walking, to strengthen the men’s bottom, to ease swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the patient's particular difficulties," says MUDr. Martin Kövári, Mayor of the Rehabilitation Clinic and Body Medicine Faculty Hospital in Motole.
While people with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same illness, they manifest themselves in a different way.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
Movemental activity, however, also strengthens the immune state of the organism, which is desirable for multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that sick people are verifying what they can do, and that strengthens their self-pity.
"In the exercise, endorphins are also flooded and people feel good about it," warns PhDr. Kamila Rozas from the Faculty of Medicine of the Royal Vinohrada Faculty of Medicine.
By affecting the physical side, we are operating on the limo system responsible for emotions.
We directly interfere with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, add.
"These patients were so often spared, we now know that they need a targeted burden," said Professor PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, priority of rehabilitation clinics and body medicine Faculty Hospital in Motole.
The goal of physiotherapy is that you can stay as long as possible, including work.
Thus, Physiotherapeutics cooperate with ergotherapeutics to get compensation aided in peace.
Many patients also need psychological or psychiatric care.
They're in a difficult situation.
When you experience a serious illness in your life, most people will shake it.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
He must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a painful soul, we're supposed to follow someone, not try to take everything on our own.
"I work with them in order to finally conclude that even with a handicap, a full life can be lived and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says Reata Malin's psychotherapist Schubertová of the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, airbuses would not fly.
Air production is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technology.
New planes are filled with titanium or light and solid composite materials, which are not capable of producing and processing directly.
Still, next to the super precise, computer-controlled machining machines, next to the autoclaves for moulding composites, you can hit onto something as common as the merujuice furnaces.
In a drum that reminds a pot on a sugar bag, the edges of the metal parts, which just came out of the milling machine, are mutilated in a pile of furnaces.
"So far, no one has come to anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of the air door manufacturer Latecoe Czech Republic.
In the premises of Prague Letňany, the former Letňa is produced by Letov complete door for Airbus A320.
As the only door in the world for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which are built in Prague, are also entering the first and higher class on the upper decks of the largest aircraft of Airbus A380.
There are also doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
The accuracy here is the main motto.
For example, the momentary keys let the company manage twice a year.
If the yellow stickers missing control records, they would have had to explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing who are driving on a regular basis to see if the doors are produced according to the agreed rules.
But advanced technology has not replaced human senses yet.
There are 1500 rivets on one door to A320.
You'll have to tear the vertebrae by hand.
It takes them two days.
Even according to the sound of the falling hammer, they will know if the rift is already properly cracked.
The tolerance they're moving in is minimal.
It may be zero to 0,13 millimetre above the surface of the aircraft.
That's about twice the thickness of the human hair.
When the inspection comes to a series of trained tweezers.
When the controller crosses a series of rivets, he will know if any of them are out of tolerance.
Then he takes the exact slope into his hand.
Letov was a member of the L-39 training program before 1989.
But in 1991, there was no more production.
The company had to quickly find new contracts.
That's when she got together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the call procedure to the emergency door supplier for model A321.
Talks to Boeing weren't so happy.
"We were for them at that time a small company that did not have enough money to invest and Boeing could guarantee long-term stable supplies," recalls Dubský.
The doors to the American producers would remain knocked up if Letov did not take part in the Prague conference of the international association of the aviation industry, the French group Latécoere.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, the meeting with the French began, says Dubsky.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new contracts came with a strong company.
The installation of parts of the door for A320 began immediately in 2000.
Three years later, the door of the upper deck for A380 arrived.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for the Boeing Dreamliner deliveries.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't get to these big deals ourselves.
Maybe we could do parts or small parts.
The partners want a supply guarantee for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubsky.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere reached a turnover of over PLN 2.9 billion and profit after tax of CZK 147 million.
The exclusive position between aircraft manufacturers' suppliers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have certificates of quality, certification 170 specific production processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the undertaking would not make any doors to the aircraft.
Get certificates that the manufacturing processes correspond to customer requirements, and in repeated controls, they are worth keeping according to Dubská million crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They're more accurate and strict.
We have to train employees, equip equipment and re-certify the whole process, deliver Dubsky.
Now the company finishes the preparation of a process for coating with zinc and nickel, which will replace the existing for human health harmful cadmium.
Although the assignment was received from the manufacturer, they had to adapt the technology to the devices or chemicals they use in Prague.
The Boeing people will come, check out the concept of the whole line.
Then we show them the production.
They'll also check our lab.
One set of samples are tested in their own lab, and then the results compare with ours, it brings Dub's way of controlling them.
The reward is the Prague company's long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague race standing today, the production of embraers falls.
For A320, it produces half of the total volume of doors.
To replace Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complex for Brazilian or European producers.
It does not mean, however, that he could say anything to himself on the door.
A price curve is part of the contract.
That indicates how many doors are going to cost at ten, fifty, the stitches made.
Price per piece keeps falling to a certain limit value.
We need to fit into this price pattern.
If we don't, we're going to make money, it says Dubsky.
Half the hall, where electrical closets are set up for Airbus A400 M aircraft, is still empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
behind the wall there is a new semi-business line for riveting and assembly of doors for innovative model A320 Neo.
The wastes will speed up and fasten.
"This is the trend in which the installation in aviation is subject," said Dubský.
The estate has a secure future line.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of the new A320 model.
A line will be created just a few meters next door for complete installation of doors for upper deck A380.
It's the strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, says Dubsky.
Before that, however, the company must undergo qualification tests for the installation of some electrical and electronic door-to-door devices for the largest Airbus.
The company also relies on further development of production from composite materials.
Apart from Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit for the company when it knows how to process composites besides metal materials," Dubsky says.
Latecoere, however, reaches the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There's no more place in Letov.
Before the French mothers entered, 180 employees had the company.
Now he has 800 of them, and within three years, there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are overrated, how many hundreds of new planes are ordering airlines every year, they don't have to worry about working.
Although she has orders for several years ahead, she faced the Prague Latecoe's parent company with a threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to spend on a glowing loan.
Finally, Latécoere was able to reach out to the prime creditors.
At the end of August, some of the loans were exchanged for shares.
In the company, the creditors gained a EUR 51.4 million share of 37.4 percent in the capital increase.
The company's debt has fallen by two-thirds, i.e. by EUR 180 million.
The second part of financial recovery came in early September.
The company signed new shares between existing shareholders for EUR 222,9 million.
In total, it raised capital by EUR 280 million.
At the same time, the whole group benefit from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which accounts for 85 percent of the market.
The average growth of contracts is expected by four percent per year until 2017.
In a custom book, orders are worth EUR 2.6 billion, equivalent to four-year production.
The French media are saying that Latécoere can breathe again after years of droplets.
Czech race in Letňany is important for groups.
16 percent contribute to the Group's markets.
According to the number of employees, he is the largest foreign branch of the group.
The Members supported a larger share of the State's coal charge.
The change in neo-forest mining fees is expected to bring more than CZK 427 million into the Treasury than in 2013.
The government is expected to have a neutral impact on the revenue of municipalities budgets, because the fee is expected to be higher.
In the preceding year, the municipality received some CZK 450 million and a state budget of CZK 150 million from the fees.
From brown coal mining, about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns were spent.
The amendment also includes an increase in the remuneration from the loading area with a chargeable charge of 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these payments should continue to be fully mined by municipalities.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the Members that the municipalities would gain annually instead of CZK 14 million to CZK 100 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but it is determined by the government by its regulation.
The remuneration is now calculated as the sum of the amount of mineral produced and the rates for individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation is a reason for change.
However, Member of the ODS Marek Benda warned against the fact that setting up a fee by government regulation may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládka, in this case, the tax is not taxed because the state is charging the mineral, which is the property of the state.
Only municipalities whose territories are affected receive fees.
In the event of deep coal mining, they will receive three quarters of the money of the village and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will also be in the event of the mining of radioactive rock.
Part of the money that the State will collect from the mining charges will be targeted.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or in order to provide the rescue service.
Today, opposition Members were criticised, who claimed in particular that it would harm the municipality affected by mining and land.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starost) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the communities as far as they have been, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget of the Minister of Finance," said David Kadner (Ustvit) elected in the U.S. region.
Ms KSČM Hana Aulick warned before the rise in unemployment in Mosteck.
Kadner and Aulický have failed to propose an amendment to reject, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government to work.
According to mining companies, the reason for the report does not reflect the increase in coal prices, because prices are made from more than 90 percent long-term.
The main consumers as power plants or heating plants should therefore not feel price growth.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the efforts to reduce their operating expenditure, which would in particular reduce the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to the latter, the increase in employment charges is reasonable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment to Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is crucial that Members, before the law is approved, know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government decision on coal mining limits.
If coal is used for limits, then it will have impact on profits for both the state and the foreign, it has highlighted.
Urban does not agree with Youth that the decision to break the limit below the Czechoslovak army should fall after 2020.
The limits at the bottom of the ČSA are expected to be broken down for reasons of social, economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time for a decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the US Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a fundamental decision on whether to increase interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
The 80 economists surveyed by the Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it took years to reduce rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a central bank could be able to get out of the zero loop and start the process of normalising interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of Peterson's institution for the international economy.
The US economy did relatively well, recovery in the form of adding dollars triillions to a state account and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be ready to increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great opportunities against this step.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day and his colleague - wrote a message in which he claims to be “fly” of the first murder and wanted him to take it back, revealed on Tuesday by government authorities.
Police at Gautieru, Mississippi, stated that Lamb, a teacher of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around 10:00 am.
And he said he shot someone.
The lamb dispatcher asked him to send the cops to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there's a "nice dog" in the house that "will not bother anyone" but is upset.
The police requested the caller's name, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb didn't explain why he was shooting at the house either.
When the police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a hand-written message from Lamb, in which it stood: “I am so sorry and wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who's ever loved me."
After leaving a message, Lamb went on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt's history teachers and then took his own life.
Dean of the University, William LaForge, said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “Mr. Lamb's head obviously had something going on. ”
Despite the Monday statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt's government authorities, they said that there was no "no evidence" about "the love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was "a great person."
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but they both stayed friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was the whole "baptized" case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald said, Prentiss worked from her home to the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," said Knowles.
The police said that Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said that he would not go to jail.
When the police caught him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods where he shot himself.
According to a CV published on the school website, Lamb received a doctorate in the field of education at Delta University in spring 2015.
The stars that lost their magic
The actor (left), in his picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years.
He fought leukemia in 2001 and lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer in 2009.
Herec also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
I'm sure all these things are taking their toll.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months from the game due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fractured right leg during the Manchester United defeat in Liza Masters against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this tear injury and removed it from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury caused Héctor Moren's careless procedure in 15 minutes when Shaw's 20-year-old was in the PSV area.
Nine minutes were treated on the field and an oxygen mask was also needed before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be transported tomorrow or maybe next day and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - the boy who comes to Manchester in 18 years has it very hard, but plays fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the lockers, he also had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in a group phase.
I believe he'll still play this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalt kick.
Nicola Rizzoli's referee didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gal said the Italian referee was wrong.
You can self-evaluate whether it was a penalta and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure both legs.
The tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you all for their messages, words cannot express how destroyed I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I will come back even stronger."
Related: Manchaster United recorded Luke Shaw's injuries against PSV
The English defender will have added motivation for recovery in the form of a European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Coc, a PSV coach, said, "It was a very bad injury."
When any player leaves the field with this injury, each one is very sad.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg during the match for Mexico against Van Gaal Holland at World Cup 2014.
"It is very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt an opponent, and when you hear of the severity of such injury, it is not good," Coc said.
I was unable to see this moment.
All I saw was a ball that was headed in a different direction, so it looked like he was touched by [Moreno], but I didn't see an intervention on Luke.
In an interview for SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I am very sorry.
The player PSV Andrés Guardado was also transported to the hospital after Chris Smalling's intervention.
I'm sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: when a child falls in love with a book, it does not take long to learn to almost forget it.
Of course, you can't be David Cameron.
At the request of the provider of children's schemes to name his favorite children's book, he chose Prime Minister Lorax, a fairy tale from Dr. Seusse of 1971.
It was hard to choose, writes Cameron in the report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "A funny, touching, creative and strong content, such as I liked reading to my children, because there was always a picture or message that I had never seen before."
Well, except in the following paragraph Cameron reportedly described the book story according to the 2012 elevator, which added other figures and details to fill out the brief original text.
"In the city of Three-Ville surrounded by walls where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of a girl's dream girl, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," is a brief contents of a book that records the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodore Seuss Geesel, who died in 1991.
As if it was not very suspicious enough, the text added by Cameron reads as the aggregate elevator of Lorex film, which is on the Internet page Movie Database, and starts by saying, "In the city of Threeed-Ville covered walls, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of a girl's dreams, Audrey."
Because he was open to a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not meet the history of the book, where the unnamed young man will learn that the local nature is devasting the countnish, trees squeezing the industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the titular Lorax, a strangled, murky creature who says "the trees."
Most likely, the relatively few important PR was given an assistant who had never read Lorex's child 20 times in a row.
Talker Downing Street said the text probably came from Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but no further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of forgetting England, but he's still holding.
To join Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England has chosen for this tour, I think the repeating of the 3-0 defeat that suffered last time in the test series is unlikely.
Also, I wouldn't rule out the guests' win directly.
The Alastair Cook Party can be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in this ball set and collective thinking is strong; they will not carry scars from 2012, only youthful positiveity.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, it represents an offensive opportunity.
Related: Adam Lyth fell out of England's team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget Adam Lyth is hard for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in demanding conditions and simple, but the harsh reality is that players of cricket are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, there were no questionables around Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and I’ve mentioned this earlier — players are their best selectors.
A few more centuries ago, and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, although his performances were not entirely 100%, and that does not surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much test time does the spine get to show up is a hard nut.
Lyth received seven hats — just like Sam Robson had before him — while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and out.
The only thing you could say is that England gave Jonathan Trott a chance in Caribbean first — although Lyth was in the best form — but this wasted opportunity is already in the past.
Here comes Alex Hales, and that's what I'm evaluating very positively.
He's the x-factory picket player we saw here in Yorkshire in the beginning of the season, when he got us 236 on the Trent Bridge field, which did a little bit.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this will, of course, depend on the overall setup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts with Cook, who gets another extra spinner while he keeps four quicks, has been brought up and I have no reservations against her.
I don't understand why the sharpieker couldn't launch, and this lefty man has already shown that he's an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them, and there's no big difference in that.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests before his performance in 2001.
He immediately had three centuries of relief, and he didn't look back.
The team comes to Zafar Ansari as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to follow it, I was captured as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — on average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see it as a threshold, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors decided for youth.
They'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside of the team, England seems to have made some changes and smart additions to their coaching staff.
The names of Mahel Jaywardenea, Sri Lanka's batter, as a consultant for the test matches, can be a master's move.
He is one of the most beautiful playable guys who bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings to the team both energy and a heartless spark.
I've always felt he was born into a world of international cricket, whether like a player or coach, and just like Mahel, he's got an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the closet, although they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, they can sometimes lighten up and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's teammates Ben Stokes got one day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many do not agree, trainers and selectors do not create a timetable.
And you must remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy started to stagnate by 2017.
The inevitable strategy of David Cameron's renegotiation to maintain Britain in the EU is getting into other problems with every day of the past without choosing the genius Jeremy "Is it yes or No?" Corbyn will take the entire situation around Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat has recently explained how Europe is stuck in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British self-center agendas, sharing concessions and disruptive changes in contracts they did not usually want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided they didn't want it even if they had taken social protection.
We can even call this selfie the Dave and George agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolis, take a picture before the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then come home with words that they win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to avoid looking into himself in Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some of the short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have come to a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German cautiously balanced Chancellor, is an ally, but she was in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it gets bad, as it was for too long-term Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande faces the re-approval or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling out, too.
Poland may soon have nationalist rule on the right side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how breaking their legs with the help of Selfie Brits who could invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving UK - something they don't want themselves because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan intentionally useless SNP notes during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in Great Britain to speed up the Brexit process, claims to be a friend.
"Repeat negotiations solved the problem" and "Britania has nothing worth negotiating."
Europeans know how expensive Fleet Street can be and how skeptical to the EU are the printing oligarch Barons because they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benne in 1975, which supported our entry of 1973 in the ratio of 2:1.
They may materially remember the name Boris Johnson, the amazing Euro-Oportunist who made his name as the Brussels rapporteur "EU strike banana" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his masculinity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of non-repayable taxes, foreigners hacking phones, and pseudo non-U.S. departments that owned most of the great newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was thinking the same thing about them, but you realized that when you're in a cage crazy with a gorilla, you have to throw bananas at her to keep you from having dinner and then for tea.
In fact, he was more like Blair than Blair himself, when he was tying Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair accepted the principle of the EU's cancelled constitution, which was sunk by the French and Dutch voters in 2005 and won him a throw-off card.
The press never forgives him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who was friendly to me on Monday in Westminster, patting on my back - I told him that he could no longer waste time on me - seems to be in danger of retaking the strategy of the boycott of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was probably now.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent strategy for media engagement, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marre, whose chair he left with the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe, I will say it nicely, it develops.
He claims to want to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the escalated trend of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly come to it.
The same said Hilary "Bem, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week when his inner Scout couldn't have decided to admit that Corbynov's appointment as an abrasive McDonnella as a shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought on TV about his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's match was more attractive.
But fighting for staying "in all circumstances" - Bennina fráz - apparently not what McDonnell said or what JC told his colleagues and Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whether the background is any sensitive painting that Corbyn wants to tell - remember, he touched me too - the discipline of the report remains important in the ages of the whole-day television transmission and especially in the faith, the groaning of paranoia and betrayal, which are social media
It is fair not to provide Cameron with a free ticket to Europe that would enable him to consider the support of the Works Party in a referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell's and Corbynov's fundamental extortion about EU membership - in accordance with their Bennite tying the economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion between left-wing dissidents, for which narcism is the central principle of dogmatic hashosis.
Just like his extortion about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end this - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their home masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - also have suspicious voters - because of the concessions of Britain when it seems unnecessary?
The United States are already quite disappointed in British 's weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the cost of conservative government in power, as I was reminded of the Monday opening of something called the British Security Forum of Impact.
Experts criticize reviews on electronics published by Public Health England
Declaration by the government funded by the Agency that there are 95 % more secure electronic cigarettes than smoking, came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have connections to the tobacco industry, listed researchers.
Experts writing in British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet critical evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by the Public Health England Agency (PHE).
PHE published a "limit" report last month, describing it as a "complex examination of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the abundance of data and alerted the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The guide in the expert magazine Lancet last month attacked the "mimonally chat base" on which the PHE found its main conclusions.
Two other experts who wrote for BMJ questioned claims that were allegedly "building on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They say that the public could expect that PHE’s claims, which are "the current best estimate, are about 95% less harmful than smoking", are based on a detailed examination of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called for the analysis of multi-criteria decisions (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on damage associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of the negotiations were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a society called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO allegedly had already received funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also approved the mandate of public health BAT in the sustainability report, notes.
One of the 12 participants admitted funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the financing that he allegedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they supplied.
The reason for selecting the panel members is not available but contains several well-known electronic cigarettes champions, some of which also declare industrial financing in the newspapers.
Some of the other ones present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in combating smoking.
The meeting at PHE was also attended by tobacco management.
The report created in this group "extremely admits," missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes would be a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and well-being at PHE, stated that the BMJ claims had already been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of two life-long smokers dies because of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small compared to them, but we must continue to examine long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what evidence has shown, and they also do not display what it was, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year on smoking-related diseases and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
The clear emphasis on current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, there are only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competences.
The BBC should end up with EastEnders, claiming former Director Channel 4
Former Director Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give their right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programs which are not made up by other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for setting up public service programs that will probably only follow a handful of people in complex broadcasting times compared to his rivals "the largest rating show, and on channels like the BBC4.
After Director Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had failed to communicate with the BBC for six years, which he worked on Channel 4.
"I am fighting for the idea that the BBC is setting up and broadcasting programs that would certainly be sent to rivals without state contributions," Johnson said at the committee for communication in the Upper House, as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you maintain license fees that I am not sure that are a good idea in the medium or long term, the creation should be reduced at least in terms of programmes that do not produce or sell.
They broadcast The Voice in Main Transmission Time because they want to get as broad as possible support to the future.
The idea that no one else would send him is a funny joke, and, of course, it's ridiculous.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be financed without a contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and understandably produced on domestic soil.
Frankly, other channels would give their right hand.
I can't understand how these are by public service.
I don't think the BBC would even weaken it in the smallest possible way.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty by getting ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comment on the most popular BBC show repeats those who former executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTuggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC will sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even more mobile public service programs of the BBC "transit to the BBC4, where it is quite often impossible to measure the audience, but they fulfil their powers and can argue when they are preparing for their covert licenseion mission £4bn, "But of course, we do all of these bullshit programs that no one looks at."
They're broadcasting them in a time when no one looks at them.
As regards the licence fee, Johnson told the commission: "I call on you to find a more regression system about who gets the best value of it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people with 150 pounds a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look at the BBC.
Former Director Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who came before the commission on Tuesday, said that the BBC should review its reithov mission in terms of "information, education and entertainment."
He confirmed that the small production volume of the BBC was now classified earlier as educational - it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take the pattern of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "information, clarification and entertainment."
On the subject of the partnership, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were sent only a handful on television, and to join commercial reporters so that we can see them all online.
“Sonogenetics” or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction that the nails are moving.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small clays change direction at a time when they are hit by sound impulses that are irresistible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and record brain activity using light
Scientists said these worms are a great demonstration of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates out of the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said that this method could replace deep-brain stimulation one day - an invasive procedure in which the patient is inserted into the brain by electrodes that stimulate the brain. The method is used for e.g. the treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms.
Observations usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Challasani found that reactions will occur when they are placed in liquids containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, bubbles increase the ultrasound wave, which then passes through the worm's body.
An increased ultrasound wave operates in the ion channels of TRP-4, located in the membranes of certain worm cells.
The sound waves open and activate cells associated with these channels are listed in the Nature Communications magazine's report.
In order to control the nail using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain the ion channels TRP-4.
When he used these modified worms for ultrasound, the sound waves were enhanced by microbublins and moved into worms where modified motor neurons were turned on.
The new method is similar to optogenetics, a pioneer tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons by light.
But Challasani had heard that sonogenetics could have many advantages compared to this technique.
Unlike the lights that must be sent with an optical fiber to the desired site in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can focus on human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases,” said Chalasani.
He added that its use would also find the method in the treatment of muscle cells and cells producing insulin.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
An advertisement reassuring British arms trade.
Take a look at the video on the anti-braze market from Amnesty International.
You're a terrible killer's shit!
Windows on the legs that break ankles!
Sorcerous missiles!
And electrical stunning shoes that cause inconvenient pain, but leave no traces!
The great voice and caricature of metaphors leave no doubt that this advertising on the world's largest weapons fair is a sharp parodies created for Amnesty International because of an emphasis on the willingness of the British government to sell arms to repressive regimes through defense and security devices at the International Veselice at ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with the opening of posters at bus stops and metres that require a second look.
"Different announcements, Travel to DLR from 15th to 18th September?" reads one, using a font with London subway stamps with DLR lines becomes an image of the tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will be attending DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The collective title of Special Patrol Group is helped distribute all over London and using the "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen's key, which is reported to be "the access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not entertained by this lyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and expert assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to the viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activists in the protest movement and realize that they have to get out in the real world to have their art impact on society.

Video Amnesty was seen on Facebook more than 100,000 people in 24 hours, and it was created by the VCCP agency working without a right to the honorary and graphic designer and commentator worked for free.
The creative director of the VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding advertising of arms trade - he saw an empty site in the ExCeL calendar - and he thought, "Let's show them a campaign that is trying to avoid."
They were messing with the creation of a more realistic risky corporate advertising, but "the addition of varied colours and animations, I achieved that it attracts more people."
"They have done a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about selling illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is that the UK Government adopts measures and ensures that torture devices do not illegally affect our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding arms trade comes from the inside of ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In the press release Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army to "on the AT4CS RS launch arm."
This includes "a uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't feel good.
Eight golden rules for living on colleges
11 years ago, I moved to college as an uninvited 19-year-old boy, still believers in bars and moral relativism, but until now I remember the tense smiles of those whom I was wrong - and numerous, long complaints to others.
All I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The move on the track can move from slightly to nerve-going to total shake.
It's tempting to fool, telling people where you come from, if you took a year off, what your opinion of Corbyn is, and why "You honestly don't even love Marmite, because people, it's just an extract from HAHAH's leave, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath - ask and express interest.
It leads to a conversation and helps you find people you like, and those you wouldn't even have fun with, even if your eyelashes were in one fire, and they would've spent fire-extinguishing instruments.
Leave the people space.
People’s rooms are often converted to a drinking reception, movie evenings and municipal public spaces, but they are also rooms where people dress and adjust underwear.

The Introverts will simply come to college.
Your room should be a shelter, yet a lot of railways turn into an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendship.
Could be hell for someone who needs a charge.
No culture lets you say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can get back to the energy that I used to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write to him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
One boy in my dorms used to say that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited inside.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to baking.
'Cause you started going to the university to the top of a mantle, knocking on a foreign door and a show with a canvas of baked cakes, it seems slightly less strange, less than 'Welcome to the neighborhood, 'I baked something for you, now smile while I ask personal questions.'
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe it'll end up giving their face a tasteful surprise.
This is, of course, the subject of you being a decent baker.
Bad condensed pieces of flour, sugar and fat are likely to cancel that others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock them on the door.
The theft of food is a common crime at student colleges.
Stealing all the chicken is a crime, of course, but is the milk drop in your tea theft?
Check twice with the milk owner.
There's a chance your milk will be offered even if they're going to gnawing inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more grown-up than my roommate who has exchanged her milk for washing the dishes to punish the thieves.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't make sounds that disturb people from sleep or study.
It's not just being a decent human being, but you're also a legendary people in glass houses.
A girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could make the drum and bass a little quiet because they were 3 nights and she had a song in the morning.
Their answer was an increase in music.
When they finally got quiet at 5:00 A.M., she let them sleep for two hours, and then she let her own music out loud, locked the door, and went to her three-hour song.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband would go to the same dorms as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be awkward if you confused your roommates for your future husband, slept together, separated and had to see each other every day, and might also take control of your joint friends?
Of course, your heart will not guarantee - but if your sexy roommate is 100% not your future husband, try at least to talk to your weaknesses.
At an uplifting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their locked room, it's just a thin border between the funny and the ham.
A good joke is fun, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door for them and put the keys in the bottle with the water that you put in the freezer - but never put their things on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva looked forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a busy time already during pregnancy with a seven-year-old Vítko.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone for her preparation and education.
With the situation, I settled quite quickly - I was very excited for the baby and I was looking for the positive.
Insecurity and by being alone with my child, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not stay alone for a long time, remember Eva today for her first pregnancy.
She has already met on the Internet at the chat house of the older Vašek, who have started talking about popular films.
Your Eva and Vítko even brought home from the hospital, but he didn't play the stepdad.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," said Eva in the documentary series Four in that 3.
The third series of Czech TV series is just to search for luck on the second try.
The Care for Vienna and for financial security of the family have been managed thanks to work on part-time and great help of mothers and help aunts.
In the end, the prospects for a child’s responsibility did not spoil Vaškov’s affection for Eve.
In general, they came together around the Vítek second birthday and now he understands Vasek as his father and calls him that way.
Although Vasek has already two adult daughters, his fatherhood in the 1960s enjoys and is also more devoted to children.
In addition to the Vítka there was another two-year-old Leontýnka and in the end even twins.
"The bag entered our family somehow naturally, perhaps even by the fact that my mother never talked to me too much," she thinks is smiling Eva.
A little room?
At least we're close.
Em and El's twins were born in the imperial cut after Eve was diagnosed with pregnant cholestase at the end of pregnancy.
This is a failure of production and the activity of bile acids, which then occur in excess of the blood pregnant and show especially itching.
Disease is dangerous for an unborn child who is threatened with premature birth and death, in mothers after childbirth usually responds spontaneously.
Emma and Ela were born to Eva and Vaška's happiness was healthy even when they were only at Week 36.
They placed the emission in the incubator on the intermediary department, where Vakova's niece works, which managed to take over and accommodate her.
The Elina was larger and immediately after I moved from IIP to my room, I had it in my room, describing the challenging periods after the birth of Eva.
She spent 20 days in her midwife until the doctors allowed her babies to pass away, which, in the meantime, managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
Waiting for children to be taken in the midwife Eva didn't enjoy it.
"I've been a crazy steak for my husband and kids," recalls the tough moments in the department of the 6th of Sunday, fourfold mother.
She considered the husband and the signature of the reverse, including because of the insensitive approach of one doctor.
However, this was not the case at the end and the doctors released Eva and the twins into home care.
The stories of the four pregnancy and births are sent by the CT1 on Tuesday night at 21:45 p.m.
A whole lot of family can make up for one another.
They live together in a small house not far from Prague, where Eva had to cope with the electrical double bed and the harsh conditions.
The house did not increase, but Vašek made Eve the pleasure of putting on a gas cooker to prepare food for six people more comfortable.
If it doesn't get worse, we'll have a cab party.
Eva is convinced that children mainly feel a family comfort and a pleasant atmosphere, not a size or a faintness of the house.
For the time being, we've had a very nice time, better than we thought.
Although the disorder is worse hidden in a small space and the smothering babies sometimes cross, but at least we're all close to each other, Eva smiles, who can find a positive side for every situation.
The safety of the work of the lighting device in the film is not a guarantee of regular intake.
That's why he sometimes goes out into Prague streets like a taxi driver.
In his 60s, according to his words, care for family finances and children physically manages how long does it take?
"I realize that, given our age difference, it will be me who will feed this family," admits Eva to the plane when asking for the future.
She'd like to go back to her job, but she's even more attracted to her own business.
With four children, I'm not exactly current for the employer.
And if it's the worst, my husband and I can talk about a cab, joke a nice blonde.
Apple hit the yo-yo effect.
They can display for everything.
A more powerful processor, a camera with greater resolution, a firmer range or a touch-to-screen display, are in short favor of recently introduced iPhons of the ninth generation.
The last two then have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The latest trend in Applu was that every new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generations whose weight slightly increased compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in the failure of the news was indeed negligible.
However, this does not apply far from the new iPhones.
Compared to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus last year, weight grew by 14 grams in smaller models, 20 grams larger.
On one hand, you can't blame yourself, last year's art of bending in Apple's pockets has suffered a lot.
It is so from the more resistant aluminum alloy 7000, which has also been reflected in weight.
But they have a much bigger impact on her.
Apple used the 3D Touch technology for the news, making the displays discern the strength of the touch.
To this it was necessary to provide another layer of capacity sensors.
The weight of the new iPhone displays increased more than twice compared to the previous generation.
For a smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams per 29 grams, in case of larger 19 to 40 grams.
At iPhon 6s, the display is thus the hardest used component.
The weights of only 143 grams are then achieved for this news thanks to the defatting bark that touched most of the remaining components.
For the larger model, the most difficult used element of the battery is, however, its weight did not change at all compared to the predecessors.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is evident right at the screen.
Weight 5.5" iPhonu 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
As far as new technologies are concerned, the display will be practical.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday, September 25, when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will start in selected countries.
Are the flakes champion breakfast for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglitci, archaeologists made a discovery that opens interesting possibilities.
They have discovered traces of housing by modern people from different times, including wall paintings, pieces of tools and so on and so on.
In 23A layer, which is dated to about 30 thousand years ago but discovered by scientists but something very similar to the rest of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, there were traces of oatmeal grains that apparently went through the process of producing such popular flakes today.
It will first get wet today, then dry, rid of packaging, so-called regiment, then sleep, and distinguishes in the air.
In the cave of Paglicca we managed to discover grain which was apparently warmed or welded, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least this suggests traces of use on two stones in the cave.
So scientists could not prove in their PNAS magazine that the cave would be a complete process for the production of flakes, but similarity is really very conspicuous.
We also have no evidence of how people of flakes could eat, but the assumption that it was with some fluid and perhaps even warm enough is, of course, offered absolutely logically.
At the same time, it is an interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before the production of agriculture.
For if the flakes interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have been preceded by agriculture for about 20 thousand years.
New station reports in Transport Podnik Town Brno.
So once again, I listened to the report of the names of the stop in Trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Przyrzak, Frazova, Spratecký.
Of course, the trolehbus was a bit louder, so the report by a man's voice was somewhat less understandable than before when the stops reported with a woman's voice.
The female voice is higher, so in deeper traffic noise it is better discernible than the deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that this voter chose the passengers themselves - I do not know who did not ask me, but it certainly chose from the studio recordings performed in an absolute silence, which, of course, sounded quite different than in the bus engine noise.
I have been living in Brno for a few decades, so the right names of all these stops have been remembered, so I don't need this report, but strangers from somewhere else, who don't recognize in Brno, and for which these reports are primarily intended, can be confused and can be at the final where they accidentally arrived, then say that the stop at which they were supposed to be on was not reported at all.
Maybe the choice of the voter - but better again, the voter - would do again, and this time under the usual traffic noise and rumble of the engine in which the spinning speaker in the bus almost loses.
So we don't have to keep listening to the names of Water Herspice, Šmírov, or Poorná in the squeaky hall that I went to in Komárov.
I suppose my old ear didn't suddenly get so bad during the one day the caller changed.
Before that day, I understood those reports pretty well.
Good morning, comrade chief.
The tracker's minutes.
Today, few people know what the largest and smarter part of the government has been called comprehensive checks.
I let myself remember that.
The bus was late.
I bumped into the dispatcher's office the moment the radio heard it was just seven hours ago.
"You're lucky you didn't meet your comrade chief, he came in one minute before you, and he seems not in the mood," noted the dispatcher while I was writing into the book of arrivals.
Thanks. I'll be careful.
Just text me that I'm going after the precincts to review the minor mechanism.
That's not gonna work, it's a check-up tonight.
They're all fucked up when they're scared.
What is it?
"You'll see," the dispatcher said.
Next time, you'll be too.
I ran into the hallway.
Then the chief's door opened and the chief appeared.
Hot, with a stone face, in a perfectly falling uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I greeted with respect and quickly turned on two buttons of jacket.
"Good morning," she said the answer, and I quickly ran to the second floor without realizing the cold, evil tone that the old man answered.
"You're playing," I was greeted by an engineer, Eva, the older lady I appreciated.
She was even chief before the comrades sat her down.
There are checks, and you get there like that.
How many times have I asked what the comprehensive checks were, but no one wants to talk about it.
They say they're once in three years, they all have to go to them, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
I'll see about that.
I pulled out of the drawer with periodic reports and that phone call.
"This is Holcman, come straight to me," the chiefs said.
What's he upsetting?
Now we've met and nothing..." I've made a mistake, but no one's answered me, just everybody with their thoughts.
"Good day, Comrade Chief, I came upon your command," I checked, I barely entered the chief office.
The chief was sitting behind his desk looking at some leystro.
"Sir, mechanizer," he said after a while, without raising his head, and he kept looking at the lefty, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw his left on the table, set himself on the back of the chair, and looked at me with the usual, unpleasant, evil, bold look.
I did.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised that I had worked very well in the office for the few months, and that he was very pleased with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the platoon at the distance.
And now this?
You realize you're a track distance technician, and that's what you have to behave.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I tripped that I've been using such greetings since I was a kid, that I've been so raised up and that I don't see anything wrong with him.
It was like a red turkey rag on the chief.
"You're on a socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is honor to work," said the trained chief.
Plus, you're still encroaching your superiors.
You say "sir" one time and the second time, "judge."
But I'm not a chief to you, but a comrade chief.
The troops are comrades, the chief trackers are comrades!
Remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but I greeted you with a common civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... with the honor of work or the comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your priority that you're not on the side," the well said the chief who calmed down a bit in the meantime.
But we'll talk about it.
Anyway, remember, the chair upstairs isn't prepaid for retirement.
That's not good.
When the Chief said something wasn't his priority, it didn't look good with the person in question.
For a while, he stabbed me with a cold, tiny view, and I sought the words I would answer.
Also, it upset me of his advanced bullying.
He was only a few years older and played God, actually, comrade.
A lifelong, inflated, authoritarian, arrogant, just as he did right now.
He was all banished.
He's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party's organization, as well as all the parties, but also the nexus, was ticking.
But the chief of staff was a man of many, especially those with whom he could apply his superiorness.
Right now, he's shot me for a complete piece of shit.
I thought something about my ass, and it cost me a lot of time to stop shooting it in his face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the junkyard no more, let alone a good official.
What would I do with two kids?
And the building!
I was sick, but I did.
I'm not going to make him happy.
"That's all so far, you can go," finished the audience chief and started to look carefully at the lefty that he had in his hand.
At 12 p.m., I was summoned.
Everyone at the office was there, asking what and how they said, yeah, it's gonna be okay.
Only Jožin said, as it used to be his custom, that they cannot fire all of us, because he would have to do the work themselves with their faithful, and that he would not threaten.
However, the word "sir" stressed that he knew what an old man had me for this morning.
There was a nice meeting at the chief office.
Comrade Chief behind his desk, and at a long advisory table, other comrades who were supposed to decide my official existence or absence.
Kadrovák, President of ROH, a staff recorder, a referent for special purposes, something to counter the military, and the deputy, my boss.
And the most important person, the president of the party organization.
I knew him from the moles.
Ordinary track worker, conquering Prague or forks threw bark.
But also an ex-gift.
It was said that there was no fun with him back then, said a pretty beast.
Bad languages claimed that school went out in seventh grade, nothing learned, didn't know anything.
And when the crime was cancelled, he ended up in the crotch.
But comrade, yes, comrade was stoned!
Chief ordered me to sit down.
I had a little soul in my neck, an uncouth stitch.
Kadrová read the report from the Civil Committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two kids and so on and so on.
It's good so far, I've thought, and I've had a little bit better breathing.
Then a judgment from the street organization.
He copied the civil committee's judgment, maybe both of them were written by the same person.
But then it came!
The family members of the members of the Party refused to come before the commission of examination and subsequently came forward, allegedly for health reasons.
Chief looked at me carefully.
The predator noticed and stopped reading.
Chief has ordered him to continue.
It was worse than that.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee, and there I was awarded a candidate for the party.
Regardless of the parents who came out, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and married, except for the National Committee, I also had a church.
I failed to trust the party in the worst way.
That's why I've been cut out of a number of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, executed a church funeral, although it was a former member of the party.
All of this, I show a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the cadaver read, only the knocking of the chief pencils into the board of the table interrupted the silenced silence.
Everyone looked at me carefully, and I wished I was far away.
And I kept repeating in my mind the "Comunists - the superhuman, communists - the superhuman." What did I get into?
Why didn't I just stay at the moor?
I could even fix the fold without any fucking clearance.
But now?
She took her career as an officer before she started.
Go back to the squad?
I don't think that's gonna work. I'm sure the Chief will be able to get me out of here for an hour.
"Siress, how did you check the comrade discussed here?" interrupted the tight silenced chief's question on the leader.
Well, according to the previous job report.
Do you have him here?
Apparently, it wasn't too many times to be a predator.
At the dropouts of sweat, he was nervously mutilating, as if he was tested himself.
He was horrified and gave the chief some paper.
"Oh," said the chief with the name of the community, but often the announcement of storms.
At first sight, the praise itself, taught with honour, graduated an industrialist, worked in a task base as a locker, filled the norm on average at a hundred twenty percent.
But it doesn't really work.
Where did you get that statement, comrade?" he turned again to the Cadet, who felt it was starting to turn against him, and that he would very soon perhaps not even have to be a cuckoo.
This is where the comrade gave it to me when he came in.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the precinct to the platoon," the blekotal kadark.
And there's no need for judgments, the extra one, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were placed in a technical function, this lot of paper was enough," the dryer was the chief.
He was nervously mutilated by the predator, and he was not able to answer any questions.
"No matter what, we'll discuss later," said Chief and Captain, obviously, the case was relieved.
It's settled for now.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned again to me.
She's suddenly telling me, so it's over!
It got dark in my eyes, I was getting hot.
He followed accusations and accusations, and I knew that I was the most disgusting creature in the world that does not deserve the slightest mercy.
That I misjudged the incomplete judgment by misappropriating the comrade of the core referent, and I did not understand why the judgment was incomplete when I received it from the leader in the factory.
I am also an antisocialist feeder who, at the time of building real socialism, supports the resemblance of religious darkness, and even participates in them.
That there was plenty of that I had committed, or maybe I would commit and quietly prayed that it would end.
I don't care anymore.
I didn't care that I'd fly out of the mechaniser's place.
I don't care if I can get that dork.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people that I was in the eyes of the comrade chief.
"That's enough, Chief Chief," he then called the party president and strongly interrupted the leader's left.
This is where the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he did stupid things!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, comrade chief!
What could be worse for a young man than we'd close the door to his side for a while!
To open up to him again, he will have to prove that he is once again worthy of our trust.
An uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is it so concise or papuškoval phrases from steam training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
Chance to prove that he's changed.
And who's to give it to him if not you, comrade chief?
Your duty to this young man, the truth, a somewhat misguided comrade, is to support his efforts to correct him!
It's your party duty that no one can get rid of you!
Actually, it's a party duty, too, to all of us.
This is where the comrade needs to see that the party hasn't forgotten him.
That as a kind mother not only punishes, but also loves.
When the chairman finished, no one looked.
No one expected that kind of turnover.
At least I did.
"I simply agree with you, Comrade President," the chief of staff said in his attempt to take the initiative again.
If you had let me finish, you would have heard that I was on my way to this conclusion.
They were all consonant with their heads, but it was in them that they didn't believe a word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a self-referent to care for basic means," I hid when I returned to the office and cried in return.
It's good that besides Evy's engineer, they were all at lunch.
The silence was listening to my inseparable trial of fresh experiences, and in the meantime, I calmed down.
When I was done, she asked me to get some coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she built water for a cook and prepared pots.
In the meantime, she talked about paradisciplinary practices.
Like one judgment, often full of praises, they will put the person in the hand, and the other, in which there is dirt, will send to the new employer.
But I'm not gonna end up where I was, but at the dumpling's shelter, and so the factory comrades didn't know where to send it.
And our cadaver?
He's only old enough to eat or drink anything, and it finally worked out what happened.
"The one from the old one gets it," she meant wickedly.
I'm sure he won't enjoy it today.
You keep an eye on him anyway, he's very vengeful.
And the party president?
In fact, a far worse chief, no human being.
Zero from the donuts having great power.
The coffee water started to crept, and the office filled with a smell of salty coffee.
I threw a sugar cube in the cup and the milk was mixing a hot potion.
Maybe I'm from the worst outside.
Now he's not gonna fire me, and there's more checks in three years.
Anyway, the second chief of the day won't just forget me.

The alien symbol is alive.
The circle of the windmill over Chlum is turning again after years.
It is seen far from here, because it is located at a height of 15 meters.
People from around here call him "the weather on Chlum."
For the village, 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the local mark, which the municipality gained for the 2010 family reunion.
"We asked for a sign at that time, and we wanted a sign, of course, that everyone knows about it," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chluman wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit a mementum of the present: it reminds us that people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in recent centuries was rare.
Until 1910, the Romanian representatives decided to solve the solution, which followed until mid - 1980s.
In the village near the branch office of China, they destroyed seven meters of deep well.
Three years later, the well was filled with metal construction with wind pump, which pumped water into a reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the church.
"The construction was performed by Antonín Kunc from Hranice in Moravia by 2 400 crowns," says the memorial inscription on the ground floor covering the structure of the stžár.
After several repairs and falls, the windwheel was served in 1971.
On 7 May 1973, a new chapter began to write: that day in Chlum began serving a new water supply.
The wind pump has already remained only an infunctional municipal symbol and its rarity here.
The Dominant was run at this year's family reunion.
Until 2008, the Chlumský decided to repair the windwheel again and bring it back into progress.
They had made a replica of the original wheel-- reduced on average by a quarter of a meter.
The wheel was set on the stžár, but the same year had to be carried down.
The producer of the replica did not choose the appropriate material and the wheel could not resist winds.
Then the chluman dominant rested in a few years under the roof.
Since June this year, however, the wheel at the high station has been rolling again.
On the occasion of the family reunion, the municipality has adjusted the replica of the wheel and replanted it at the top of the Iron Tower.
But the bike draws useful water from the well to the pad blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected him because there was little water in the well.
At least it turned empty.
"In the fall, then the shaft of the windwheel from the pump in the mass basket will be disconnected again," explained Mayor Mašek.
The chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic, where the windwheel has reached the municipal mark, but it is the only village of this kind in the whole of Vysočina.
A similar element in the mark have to honor local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Green Hora in Vyškovsk, in Kuželov in Hodonínsk, Partutovice in Přerovsk or in Police in Vsetín.
No offense, but I don't know Lafat, she admitted the resistance of Tripoli Goian.
"A match against Slavia I remember very well, even my goal, as well as everyone in my career," smiled 34-year-old Goian at the pre-war press conference.
That's when George Hagi trained us, it was bad that we lost.
I hope I score my goal now, Sparta.
Just the difference that we will not lose this time," Goian continued.
This man who played 60 games for the Romanian representation is the key support of the Greek team.
As a tracker, he will face the raids of the Spartan offensive.
There will be a few thousand people, no hell, talking about the Greek struggle with Spartan Hybš.
And part of the ink that can wait him Thursday night.
I know Fatai, who played with my brother Lucian in Romanian Astra.
At that time, I saw all their fights.
I know he's a very good assailant, which is why he went to Sparta too, said Goian.
Another footballer didn't name the Prague club, and so came a direct question whether he knew David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of Czech league and captain Sparta.
The Goian smiled and focused on Czech journalists with an easy-to-reading view.
A helpless look on his face said, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a while of silence, he started.
We saw some videos, and I noticed Sparta playing a lot of teamwork.
He's got a really good player.
And Lafat?
No offense, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The sardines know very well about Goian.
"My experience from larger clubs, can be said to be holding the defense of Asteras, is such their game organizer," pointed out by Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Although Goian has the best summers behind him, he can boast of a very interesting football resume.
At the time he was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both of the United and City Manchester units, but Steauy went to Italy's Palerm, played also for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European cups, he is fighting for victory in the Czech League.
For me, it's a favor in this game, but we're playing at home and we want to start the group off with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, said Goian.
I am in peace with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who enjoys competition from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland due to company shares in the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary objective is to have the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken during the project are mostly legal and administrative and do not have a real impact on the situation in society, says Daniel Buryš, Managing Director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the Group headquarters, shareholders consider placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to joining the Prague Stock Exchange, the company finishes a prospectus of valuable paper, which will be presented to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of holding offices and related transfers of shares will be made in the form of non-public transactions, with only existing shareholders being involved.
As part of this operation, no shares will be offered to the public or new investors.
"The future offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders decide - later, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issuance of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on a stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
The Czech Television objectivity test in informing about the crisis of migrants.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of news coverage of the main Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time the broadcast of the main news coverage of Czech TV.
How did she end up?
When they are taught at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can launch today's broadcasts Czech TV Events.
The migrant crisis was dedicated to about 80% of the news broadcast.
Except for the first minute when the ČT informed them of the riots on the Serbian-Maďan border and attacks of migrants on police officers, she called them euphemistically suffering - throwing stones and attacking metal bars), already the current promigrant propaganda - judge the names of each report.
Critics of NGOs - a great space for non-profit organisations that criticise the poor treatment of migrants.
Syrian children at the Czech School - a story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat but as a chance.
Running fugitives - ČT consistently uses expressions of runners or fugitives and not migrants.
The striking fact is that the CT uses only consistently and only small children and women's images in the illustrations.
In the same way, she said that 80 % of the men were detained in the Czech Republic.
Summary: Most of the propaganda that doesn't have an obscene from communist agists.
I must say, as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my fellow colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
I soon stopped becoming the only citizen.
I had some fish in my bathroom.
Domestic fishes, insects with a change of imperfect, i.e., the non-alcoholic infertiles of bugs and youth appear to be an adult, only small and gradually growing.
They were mean to me, and I didn't make them rich.
First manually and chemically later.
Socialist drugs at their disposal provided some blue crystals.
I think it was called Cycle B.
Or something else?
This has, however, been eliminated successfully.
Later, I dealt with the Pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with some juvenaliser that the ants brought into the nest, and then he wouldn't let the queen generate a new offspring.
But that's what I'm turning around.
As the time went, insects became the subject of my admiration, and I became more and more inclined to think that they had the same right to live as our people.
Moreover, I have learned from my life that interference in the ecosystem does not lead to success and that one pest can replace another.
The truth at the fleas and the bug, I don't think I could do any harm to their karma by killing them.
In a new apartment we agreed with a partner that if we don't get fisherman behind our necks, let them eat their skins of waste, some of those invisible algae, and so on.
Their peaceful existence over time broke the spider.
It was a common kind of treat, long-term seat on the ceiling.
We thought he lived from the occasional flyers and mosquitoes, which just made us feel more comfortable.
Because he lived with us for several years, we found that he is feeding mainly with fishers and that he apparently maintained their number on a loading number.
We discovered that it was a female.
For we have seen romantic conversations with a partner about a third smaller than a third of the smaller ones, as carefully as the spider fibers, so that they do not eat before they reach the ecclesiastical coulomation.
It took about three days when they didn't move and react to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love toys were played, we found the remains of the dried male next to the female later.
Then the spider hasn't moved in weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by a lot of little spiders hanging around.
They're missing soon.
They were eaten by mothers, and they were separated by others.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
If she left somewhere else or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, she showed up again on the ceiling.
True, slightly smaller, probably the daughter of the great-grandfather of the toilet.
For some time from the ceiling cautiously observed our behavior and moved under the toilet bowl assessed our failure as friendship.
The numerical state of somewhat multiplied fishes decreased again, and the spider looked at its normal food care activities peacefully.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed all year.
Our daughter, between that, grew up to the age when the use of the night was already a disgrace.
We've tolerated it so far, but we've had a long time to pour out its contents.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more strongly.
However, the daughter found an excuse in the spider for keeping her habitation, which she saw very well during the torture.
Our talk of seeing spiders, luck in the house was never taken.
She was crying and screaming and forced into her nightstand.
It wasn't too much.
There was a time when the spider had to be broken down, in the interest of a daughter's developmental shift.
It's on me.
He was dragged into a glass and shown over a balcony somewhere in the garden.
I was talking to him like a friend, but I still felt awful after having had sex with him for so long, like I was throwing out a relative.
We assumed that the fishes would start to appear more frequently and they would start multiplying by a geometric series.
The world wonders, a week, two, we don't see any show up.
I started speculating about the cause.
I was wondering if there was this spider after the model of the ants, somehow he didn't conceive that the toilet environment was not as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were already wet again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured that their connection to the spider had to have a cause for not seeing him being hidden in any other place and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some telepathic connection with their predator and his rapid disappearance in them caused an alarming reaction.
I mean, I don't do any illusions about their eyesight.
There was some spotlight, but they would react to the waveling of hands or quick movements, no.
My daughter's been going to the bathroom all the time.
I think she forgot the nightstand.
All we have to do is bring back some spider.
I'm already sending my wishes to the ether, and I hope they didn't close to me after the expedition.
Otherwise, we'd have to use that Cycle B.
A desatero of Albert Einstein's remarks that enriched the world.
Evidently, the benefits of a brilliant scientist from the past century will never cease to be fascinating.
He proved to be so deep that the explosion was always a stunning finding.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
In the consciousness of people entered primarily his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its giant ratio.
Also, it cannot be forgotten by its clarification of photofection or the idea of quantuming electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the self-description and system of knowledge of popular relativity theory is so complex for many that for closer familiarity it prefers to choose easy dimensions.
But it's not easy.
But it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation: The clock near your nice seems a minute; a minute in a hot furnace seems an hour - and that's relativity.
I chose to choose those ten people who literally captured me from his whole piles of famous quotes.
Smart people try to solve problems, genius try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of temptation can ever prove that I was right.
But the only time he can prove that I was wrong.
But it's a sad period when it's easier to break the atom than to destroy prejudices.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, what then reflects the blank table?
I don't know what's going to fight in World War III, but it's going to be sticks and stones on that fourth.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
It's dangerous to know little and to know much too.
If I had an hour to handle the problem my life depends on, I would spend 40 minutes with his study, 15 minutes with his analysis and 5 minutes with his solution.
In the world, the hardest thing to understand is income tax.
To conclude, I cannot forgive Einstein's formula for the definition of success: If we take A for success, we pay formula: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to hold the tongue for teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in Zlín region expect changes for 1.5 billion.
"It's a success, considering that all four are held in black numbers this year," said the captain Stanislav Mišák.
The overall profit of the county facilities is now about 32 million crowns.
The share is mainly higher than that of insurance companies which are equally favourable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after years of poor, hospitals can finally afford more investments.
In the Podměříž, Vsetín, Uherský Hradiště and Zlín are therefore facing the buildings that will together cost nearly 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period when we were shopping mainly for instruments is over.
Now we need to start building new buildings, because without them top health care is not being done, it has justified the plans of the regional meeting for health care Lubomír Nečas.
He enjoys changes in all hospitals.
The builders are coming to the hospital next year.
In Vsetín, suppliers are now picking up a new internal pavilion for nearly 300 million crowns.
There's a dialysis port planned in the mire.
Uherské Hradiště wants to build a new internal for about 200 million for this year's open central pavilion.
And the Bať hospital inlín is waiting for a long-standing construction of a new central income and an internal emergency of three-quarters of billion.
In all cases, it is a fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, both patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," said Ms. Věra Prousková, for example, for the construction of the Viennese Internal Affairs Director of the Věra Prousková Hospital.
The five-story building there is supposed to be finished in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for both internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, beds and a unit of intensive care.
More comfort for patients.
The changes that most patients experience are affected by all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, there are many sick people in one room, on the floor they have just one toilet, beds are inexcusable, windows untitted and health caremen do not have the right conditions for work.
"For example, our internala was built five years ago, and now he is at the border of his lifetime," pointed out by the director of the Berlin Hospital Pavel Calabek.
For several years, it will be replaced by a seven-story modern building connected to an urgent income.
Doctors and patients will have all the acute departments in one place, plus new premises.
The same model is already in the middle of the finished Uher Castle.
The central income is already standing, and within three years the internal will be added to it.
"We will pay our loan and partly from our own resources," explained Petr Sládek.
This hospital can afford its own funding as the only one in the county.
Ziksk still has the highest and has not reached a loss two years ago, when, perhaps, the Zielsk hospital faced nearly a two hundred millionth loss.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenue and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," Vlastimil Vajdák, who is responsible for the economy.
The improvement is also expected in patients outside of the cross-border hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years, he'll be in repairs, new instruments and reconstructions of up to half a billion crowns.
This year, there will be a complete repair of the capture station, then the dialysis port will begin, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one has explained to me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
The Minister of Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD), following negotiations with European colleagues, complains that the other Czech states are pushing for quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but no discussion.
He also points out that no one has yet to explain to him how the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic should maintain if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We didn't get the answer, and therefore we wanted quotas to be released from the final text," the Chovanec told the journalists.
Can you describe more specifically the position you have come to the meetings of the Interior and Foreign Ministers of the European Union?
We disagree with mandatory quotas like a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants as salt bags or flours.
They're living beings that have visions, they're going somewhere, they're related.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we could sustain migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not get the answer, and therefore we wanted quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration sites, border protection, camps outside of Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we're saying this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
We handled forty thousand a couple weeks ago, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how are we gonna keep these people in this territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants to see us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others, who take to the Czech Republic as their target country, are seeking asylum from us, but the interest of people in this migration wave, i.e. Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You mentioned that refugees didn't even want to come to us, but 15 hundred people already committed to accept.
Couldn't it be possible to accept them more this way?
We're committed to accepting 1500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even with the 1500, we're going to lose 1100 people in the asylum procedure.
They come to our facility and we treat them the same way we caught them.
It is a big question, and we will debate it with Europe, if we can hold people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe is acting like they cannot be detained if they have registration.
This means that they will come to our territory with registrations, and if there is no agreement yet, it may happen that even those 1100 will not stay in the Czech Republic and they will leave Germany after coming to it again.
If we can hold them for asylum, we will deal with the asylum procedure.
If it is a citizen of Syria, Eritreje, almost 98 percent according to European statistics, they will receive international protection.
Then they will receive documents that will enable them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end up in target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people staying.
This is the second project that is still running, and there we have only progressed to debate with churches on the possibility that they can help them get employment, accommodation and so on.
But that's a very long track.
You said the other states weren't willing to discuss with us at ministers' meetings.
But isn't it so that the Czech Republic just rejects quotas, but does it offer no solidarity step to unlock the discussion?
And how exactly do you think it's supposed to be a solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany tells an incentive that all Syrian migrants can reach them, then the report goes on the lines of hours after all camps around Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
This calls for another migration wave that goes to Germany because they just don't want to come to us.
We think that the path is to protect the external borders - simply those migration waves to discourage, help the necessary, and separate the economic migrants.
To show them clearly they don't have a chance.
Only 50 thousand Kosovans came to Germany last year.
From the security of Kosovo, where we apply all the saturation of this state, including police, courts, state representations.
If we could separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economy, the 50 percent of what the social systems are spending on them today could go to refugees.
In contrast to the first day Germany carried out checks, the number of persons detained in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's 80, the first day was 12.
Where is this supposed to go to make the border controls go up again?
We were afraid of getting caught in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we handle.
We still have a few hundred free seats in stone detergents.
Of course, all the people we hold back will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We're doing it the standard way.
The Austrians are the only ones who take our people away, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - that's a completely useless story.
So where's the breakpoint then?
Could it be a thousand bucks a day?
I think it would have to be, like, a couple hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, three consecutive days, exhausting our capacity enough to come up with crisis plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would call upon an extraordinary government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in contact several times a day.
If this situation were to happen, the government could sit in de facto immediately and by one resolution, decide to strengthen the military police, give it a customs administration, or a prison service.
The national variant is an exceptional state which has now declared Hungary in some places?
I don't think we can get this far.
Do you realize that our positions are different, we are the national state within Europe, the Schengen border is only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would happen to make this happen in the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have, from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests rather that Hungarians try to divert migration flows to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct trip to Austria.
The Czech Republic would have touched it very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia has paid a lot of debt for the last moment.
He's trying to stop the announcement of bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid off her debts.
The football players also waited for their money.
Football Slavia stood on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings before the court.
Almost three months after Online Services from Pacific Samoa submitted a proposal for her about CZK 20 million.
Attorney Slavia Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzl in a few hours that he had no bankruptcy over Slavia.
And it must be said that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week, the new owner of Slavia became the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimán.
Apparently, money came from the new owners to the club at the last minute.
This also shows Slavia's statement before Tuesday's trial - the Wršovický club on Monday, just the day before the trial, sent tens of millions of crowns in debt.
"Everything was paid off between 11 September and 15 September," said Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Contemporary and former players and business partners.
In particular, for example, the Slovak exrepresentant Milan Ivanov or Czech reserve Maria Ličkov.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenick.
On Friday the club also paid due to city part Prague 10.
As part of the insolvency dispute, de facto only claims that Slavie violates.
According to the club, the commitments were either not at all, or are being brought to trial.
However, we are prepared in the event of the loss of these disputes, to pay the amounts.
"We have the necessary funds in our bank account, which we can file with a statement from the account," said Judge Mládková.
"All that was paid after maturity," said Mládková and added that they were not paid only due or disproportionate commitments.
It is also certain that the judge will not decide in the coming days and that the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid those debts.
As a result, all evidence will be evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The Judge ordered the continuation of the negotiations on third November.
However, the decision does not fall to this meeting, but it will be written in writing.

FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of invertor associations of resources.
The combination of state-of-the-art technologies, hardware and software equipment integrated into modular construction brings benefits and rapid return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, which is why the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
And that's all, from welding of structural steel to welding special alloys, as well as from welding rough materials after welding thin sheets, from application in workshops to welding in yards.
The incredible amount of welding curves, simple setting and expansion of the welding source enables you to react quickly to changing requirements, which reduces the simplicity, the need to convert resources and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with top welding processes developed by Kempi, which ensure higher productivity and quality of welding.
The waste of time and waste of material or repair of misconceptions is stopped.
Flexibility is ensured, is less simplicity, more welding and higher profit.
It is this year's news, which had its premiere in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We appreciate these things because they confirm the exceptionalness of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers can boast similar systems, but due to the differences in software and parameter management, the FastMig X is one of the world's tops.
Surely, for the interested party, the delivery times that are about three weeks old are pleasant.
We have already made first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will surely expand after the Brno Fair.
We have been regular participants for over 20 years, and almost always our business results are better after him than before, stressing for ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, head of Kemppi stores in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, which is why the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka was going to build a way of not falling.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert in the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka went to beat it and it's safer, says the expert.
The tunnel complex Blanka was possible to build so that there were no two groundfalls in the Prague Stromovka, claims the production director of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovič.
He said it on Wednesday night at the journalist's tour of the tunnel.
But he thinks it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a price-security compromise.
"Tunel was more secure, but costs grow exponentially," said Butovich.
The conditions in Stromovka have been the same, but the country has only fallen a few steps from where it began to go with a safer and more careful method.
"If the measure had been applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would have been more expensive by half a billion," Butovich said.
Tunel Blanka fell three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater in Stromovka was founded, in 2010, the land fell through the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to director of Metrostav Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessaryly expensive, said the Euro Week.
The construction was intended to cost 17 billion crowns according to its original intention.
When you add VAT, which twice jumped out of 17 billion for the construction period, you have twenty-one billion.
When technology, land ransomes and engineering activity, valorization and similar items are added, it is 29 billion, which is no longer that far from 37 again, said Bělohead.
That's what someone ordered and paid for.

Mixed FedEx profit, reduction in fiscal outlook 2016
FedEx reported the unsatisfying results in the last quarter and the massive reduction in annual forecasts due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also stated that it was planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holiday.
In this period last year FedEx announced that it would hire 50 000 seasonal workers on holiday.
The company shares decreased by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trade 45 minutes before the Wednesday opening.
FedEx states that it expects an income between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, which means a 20-cent decline in previous predictions.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced view comes in spite of an increase in interest rates on average by 4.9 percent, which is reflected in January. 4, and a higher allowance for heavy or large parcels ground transport, which start in November.
The company stated that it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO of Fred Smith said that "the company has demonstrated firm performance despite less expected economic conditions, especially in the manufacturing industry and in the global trade."
The holiday plans were announced the day after the rival UPS indicated that it was planning to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, which is about as much as they hired last year.
In August 31, FedEx received $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The profit for the shares was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted to be 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
The markets increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts asked by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in the priority international shipping service in recent years, which has caused revenues in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But boom in online shopping strengthened the ground results of the FedEx unit.
In the last quarter, land income increased by 29 percent, but the operating profit was essentially the same for higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The expressive unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while profit decreased in freight due to higher labour prices.
In the pre-trade of about an hour before the opening of the FedEx share, it decreased by $3.85, or by 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decline of 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the record of June 11th.
At its most expected meeting over the years, federal reserve legislators will spend two days this week at 27 feet of the Hong Kong Mahagon Table and decide whether it is time to increase the key interest rate after almost ten years.
At one end of the central bank's ornamentation, a two-story meeting room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to give the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The Central Bank has a dual charge from Congress: maximising US employment and maintaining its prices stable.
But since the Fed's Great Recession, they recognised that there was an unspeakable third term of office: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, whether the American economy is ready to be released from unprecedented stimulus in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates on the spot from the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows a strong growth in the economy, recent turbulence on the global financial markets could already frighten the Fed due to the addition to instability by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - even more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will first of all be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economist of the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for a pretext to avoid increasing levels, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them sufficient justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what Fed will do, which itself causes nervousness in the financial markets.
About half the economists recently asked by Blomberg anticipated an increase in the rate this week.
However, financial markets expect Fed to delay the issue with a key indicator of only about 30% of the chances of increasing.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market in case Fed raises rates only if politicians reduce the default by promise that further increases are not taken into account.
On Tuesday's industrial average Dow Jones jumped up by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The assembly was launched with the expectation that the Fed politicians would keep the rates quiet this week, says John Lonski, chief economist in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed had now lifted up the rates," he says.
If the Fed politicians did this, they'd have to go to extremes in their programme statement and hold hands on the financial markets to avoid panic.
Other experts argued that increasing the rates would calm down the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty from how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be on a good way to raise the rate by 0,25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the power of economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that through spring and early summer, it expects an increase in rates this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Even though job creation slowed down in August, the labour market has seen strong growth this year.
The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that Fed considers full employment.
The wage profits showed signs of lifting.
And although inflation continues to be under the annual 2% target of the central bank, the Fed politicians argue that the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices was the main reason why.
"The economy can cope with higher rates and needs them taking into account the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets throughout the world began to reject at the end of last month after China devaluationd its currency.
Dow Jones’ industrial average dropped by up to 16% under its record value in May when investors were worried that the slower Chinese economy would go down global growth.
The market was somewhat reflected in this month and Dow is now losing only 10% of May’s maximum.
The restless market situation of Fed’s policy agents adds a comprehensive calculation when to start an increase in interest rates.
"In the absence of what happened in the financial markets, and reports on the weakness of the Chinese economy over the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, researcher of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data on which they could rely on the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health situation of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main interests, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact Fed became the monetary authority of the whole world.
The influence of central banks in recent years has been enormous.
A mere sign of the then president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013, that Fed could "consiste" their monetary expansion on the market, triggered cramps all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are still more narrowly connected, it can be expected that Fed leaders are also monitoring developments elsewhere, but they are also advised with other central bankers and experts so that they can better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, Head of Global Strategy for Rich-Management by Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "Fed has history of overflows in financial markets that seem to be independent of economic foundations."
Lucker, a voting member of the Federal Committee for the Open Market, which pushed for an increase in rates, quoted decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led Fed to a reduction of its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during the three sessions "Although the limited identifiable effects on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officials turned these cuts.
The Fed should favour concern for financial stability only during the great crisis, such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., former member of the Bank of England Committee.
The latest versions are not even close to this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of price growth because markets got upset," said Posen, President of the Institute for the International Economy Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get on the board.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinese Quarter
The market/storage was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese neighborhood, not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/storage is the only contact point that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian refreshments, and kitchen dishes, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part if you need a little engine oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to go through all the alleys.
If you're hungry about all this, get a meal at LAX-C BBQ Express.
Internal trade stand (good, cheap) is close to registers and has different sampling sites.
What's in stock: Do you need anything - anything Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in large quantities.
Mez fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruit and more.
The expansion of the meat is large, such as fish - the staff of the counter will wash you and the depots, even fry it for you if you wish,
A good part of the trade is left to a massive freezing section, where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef and gallbladder, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, freely sold semi-premises and others.
Who buys here: Owners of restaurants and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
Wide streets meet shopping carts and forklifts.

The store is located in the Los Angeles industrial area, surrounds the suburbs of Chinatown and centres - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the motorways will remain at the same time as the old one.
Acceleration to 150 km/h The House rejected.
The selected sections of the motorway will not be possible to increase the maximum allowed speed to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, so decided by the House when it acceded to an amendment by the Senate, which refused to increase speed.
The amendment of the Road Traffic Act will now lead to the President.
President Zeman said, by the end of April, that the law would allow the foot-and-mouth rate entering.
The Minister of Transport Dan Ťok (for the ANO), according to which the Czech motorway network has not yet been built at such speed.
On Tuesday, the members of Parliament supported the Senate version of the law.
The approved amendment now allows according to the original government proposal to increase speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first class roads, in particular four-speed roads.
The House first extended this possibility even on motorways where it could be driven in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate rejected it.
The Members have now responded to his proposal.
Senators with the consent of the Minister of Transport from the amendment also removed the permission of the transport police to have the last word when adjusting local communications to be taken care of by municipalities.
The Senate version, approved by the House, includes also for the sewering, waterworks or cables of the public lighting, can be stored longitudinally under the surface of the wagons.
The municipalities would have saved the land to buy.
Also, municipalities should not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
The amendment is also designed to help improve road protection and facilitate the foreign handling of separated vehicles to which the owners do not report.
Newly-known vehicles could be sold by the municipalities, which will not be notified by their owners within six months of notification of the departure.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight through their territory from roadways of the other and third classes under the threat of fines, even for freight companies.
The amendment is also interrupted by the possibility of introducing electronic highway signs instead of existing papers, which will be used even after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it saves money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The officer's going to court.
He's run out of 10 years for the previous welcome of the villagers.
The case relates to an alleged overpriced hearing project.
The police wanted to prosecute Mr Zuzana Kailov in this case, but the House of Chamber of Deputies did not publish it.
According to legal qualifications, two to ten years in prison are at risk.
The main presentation is scheduled for two October days.
According to a U.S. Attorney Mandík and Maciek, at least one million crowns caused damage, results from prosecutions.
The applicant leans on an expert opinion.
According to the plaintiff, former members of the city’s leadership have unlawfully enabled the company to obtain the property benefit that it organised.
Mandice according to the prosecution of the then major head of the District Department of Urban Services, Education and Culture imposed five connected companies to address in the selection procedure.
When another company that offered the lowest price came into the competition, the Competition Hall cancelled.
The contract was then to be entrusted to the administrator and only Darothore, who then assigned the City Council to the competition.
The city paid at least a million more.
Both allegations aimed at ensuring Darothore's award of a public contract for the holding of the events of the Vienna of the municipalities in Ústí nad Labem for a long time and coordinated action at least contrary to the demand for the procedure with the proper householder, writes the prosecutor.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that Darothore subsequently after obtaining this contract, it will charge Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Vienna event a prize which will be disproportionately higher than the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the file for the project, the company received more than five million crowns.
In the end, the city paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, and then quit the contract.
According to expert judgement, the paid amount was at least one million crowns overpriced.
Mandice has already refused any violation of the law.
I didn't commit crime, I'm innocent.
This case I don't understand, said earlier, the former Mayor, saying that the city under his leadership was just committed to a similar project from past years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was provided by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, with the same money," Mandík added.
The Kriminalists originally wanted to accuse and Member of Kailov, who was also a member of the City Council.
But the House of Deputies didn't give her up for prosecution.
Therefore, in her case, the criminals put the kauza away, but they count on Kaila's accusation after her mandate was ended.
The welcome of the cults was social events, which took place several times a year.
The mothers received a $5,000 gift check for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
The Hungarian police reportedly deserted a dog fugitive.
Then they got the journalists to delete the record.
The Hungarian police reportedly stopped the AP cameraman shortly at the border and forced him to delete the record on which the police dog allegedly hit the refugee country.
However, the Hungarian government is questioning this accusation.
The reported incident took place on Saturday night, when the cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia across the cornfield near the Hungarian city Röszke.
The refugees got hit by police officers, and one of them let a Syøan attack a dog with a basket on his face.
The dog of a man who shouted "Please, I am a fugitive," says Muzi.
Muzi's filming everything, he noticed one of the cops, and he wouldn't let him leave.
Then the journalist could no longer telephone his superiors, nor his colleagues on the scene.
Muzi's police have taken him to a dark place at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what's being recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the footage.
Muzi lost his two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
AP sent a protest letter to the Hungarian spokesperson Zoltan Kovács.
Police officers treated him as unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to fear that the government would destroy legally acquired material.
With reference to Muzi's police report, Kovács questioned the events.
He said the police just wanted the journalist to show them if they were on some of the footage, which they're entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him.
"The dogs can bark - they are trained to scare off and a little afraid, but they did not turn away with certainty," Kovács claims.
An unforeseeable Champions League.
The winner of City is gonna kick us, believe Juventus.
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserve to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, coach of hometown.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was the classic League of Champions game.
Not one team made up a lot of opportunities, but the ball on the kickers was longer we.
"The cause of defeat was not in the tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," evaluated Pellegrini's match, whose team was incarcerated in the competition after a long 636 minutes.
This finalist of the last season Juventus was in front of one another’s clash exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian League has only a point to defend the title and score 2:4 is located at the 16th place of the table.
And that's why Etihad Stadium's turnover was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistances before the new year - Pirla, Tévez and Vidala.
There's Pogba, Manchukič and Morata in Manchester.
"It's true, this victory is very important, perhaps because of it we will find the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we are on it, we rank among the best teams in Europe.
We were better at the second half, especially at the attack stage.
This result deserves my players.
"Unfortunately, before our compensation goal we could reach 0:2, but Gianluigi held us," said the coach Allegri Golman Buffy.
"We burned down a few good chances," cried Yayu Touré, backup City.
We need to take from the League of Masters experience and try for a better outcome next time.
Good-bye, Angela, good-bye, old Germany II.
Before continuing on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that the whole media friction around is managed by professionals.
According to media needs and from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today there are newspapers and a media full of kids that carry on their parents' hands after the dusty roads of the exod.
And it causes a person - that is, in a European person - to automatically feel guilty and compassion.
Well, they don't come here just desperate kids, notice the footage of the landing boats to the Greek islands that they don't see so much on them!
And somehow recently we have disappeared from television images of ships heading for Lampedus, fleeing from the French border of Menton, where thousands of young men lay their beautiful promenades.
A lot of young black people.
And the pictures from Callais also disappeared, where these snowmen and black men are waiting to get through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he's getting it anymore.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans have somehow made a special impression on the people of Europe.
Too much falsehood.
So when it's a quota for a fugitive, it's kind of a secret that it's not just unfortunate kids from Syria, but also a secretive one - for elders: fashionably evaporated - young men.
Their musicals look like they've just come out of a fitcentre.
Only one personal experience.
This summer on Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on a private beach hotel.
No matter how private she was, suddenly a large group of cars arrived at the beach.
But no hams.
And young blacks came out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They walked into the beach, all the clothes in brandy and shoes, in the hands of the other way, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, it was not interested, and the employees - Turkish, Muslims! - were obviously afraid of them.
They've taken all the loungers.
He who wasn't lying on him, and he was in the sea, bad luck.
They were dressed like a American rapper movie.
On the heads of a nail cap, white and colored adidas on the feet.
Then they surrounded the local beach bar and started to farm.
They occupied the tables around, stuffed themselves next to sitting with the snow and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children went somewhere peaceful from the dining terrace.
The incoming black people drank beer straight out of the thirds - as in the shows from the USA?! - on the beach they threw empty bottles around each other.
They were always yelling at each other.
Well, it wasn't English, of course.
Then they put themselves in a drink of wine, also straight out of the bottle.
They were jumping into a hotel pool - in brandy swimmers, especially young ladies - in the water they were screaming and crying, mothers with children and pensioners fled horribly and in half an hour was no longer on the beach or in the pool a black guest.
They're all gone.
No matter whether there was a Christian or Muslim.
The staff of the hotel were afraid to talk about them.
The waiter told me this evening in half, "Have you seen the gold that they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they definitely didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had a massive cross on his neck, like, a 20-inch massive of gold.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"These are drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've always seen them drink," said the waiter.
They don't even use drugs.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I figured out what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105 it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what would follow.
But secret services and top politicians should have known first.
They don't seem to know.
Some 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at that time.
And they go and go and go.
Today, it has proved that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correspondent politicians, like intellectuals, and their attached lobbyist and economically important groups have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - today the publicly recognised main force in Europe - lie, lie, and lie - but not only they, also the tops of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television pictures about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of photos of Moscow television from August 1968.
Of course, there were some sun loungers at the station, but mostly - ancient - Muslim - Muslims were welcome to their collective.
In the long weeks, they were babbling on news on Czech television, as according to some research by the Germans, almost everyone for the arrival of emigrants.
But whoever was only a few days in Germany knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, famous research public opinion organized ARD - Czech Association of public transport television companies Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of the Germans wanted to accept more refugees a week ago.
This was also reported by our TV.
However, they concealed what happened the next day in Germany: that an ancient vote on the article showed that 94.5 percent of the Germans no longer want - 67 000 people participated in the survey.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, i.e. five years ago, stated: "Our attempt to o'multi-culti society has completely failed."
Then she said, "German gives up the fight for multicultural society."
"All efforts for such coitus have failed altogether."
In a country where four million Muslims live, she did not see a strategy that enabled people from different cultures to live together without integration. Today they live with us and we lied for some time that they will not stay that one day they will disappear.
That's not reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say that we just live happily alongside each other, has failed this approach.
He totally failed.
But neither Merkel may have the strength to go against powerful Germany and Europe, and especially against political integrity.
It shows an escalation of events.
Conflict increases fast.
Euroněmec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, Member of the SPD, the only one who allegedly does not have even graduates in the europarliament - yes, that is the one Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said that he could play overseers in the concentration unit for a minute - as he has done more than once.
It seems, especially under the impression of the last statements of German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that up to some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the states of countries that have been victims of Naziism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
For years, which years have they tried, at least on the outside, dealt with their terrible past of an aggressor and a murderer of millions?
Is it true that what they say in the soul of Germany is to put the devil's aggression, superiority, and violence?
Was he right, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, when he stopped all his attempts to control the entire center of Europe?
When did he say that Germany's grand idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When they dropped him off, she began preparing for World War I.
The idea of Velkonemeck, which led Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in another form.
After the Marxist attempt to dominate the state, such as the Rote Armee Fraction, and after the failure of the NDR, Germany has started to develop new German ideology, for example, based on ecology, which, by the way, was one of the main ideas of Nazism.
We'd say sunshine.
German elites have long defended the emergence of German nationalism, and so they left in peace all those fighters against the atom, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi password Our forest has to live.
To satisfy the restless young people in the world who want to do something differently and better, they fully lean on the side of fighters against planet heating, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strong anti-Semitism in this current - so-called propalestinian - and the antislovan current considered all Slavs to be a difficult bag - from Karl Marx's age, which, after his parents' Jews, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the last statements of Schulz and German Mints show, openly threatening the unobedient Eastern states, the idea of the leader of Germany.
Which must be listened without forgiveness.
Otherwise, you're upset!
And when we mix it with the fact that immigrants are a very powerful group of voters, we have what we have.
And it stands behind this as always capital, especially German, which is suitable for it and which is the case that Germany actually controls most European countries through banks and the Union.
The Sunshine Pedestrian first led the Germans into the swamp of ecologicalism and multiklturalism, bringing them home today and today, perhaps, bring millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by the voices of siren, will soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and are going to storm.
Germany can only again threaten its neighbours with force, once again can part of its inhabitants - but, as it seems, a smaller part - ideologically misplaced, but eventually the reality as it has always been achieved.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim hostel's already on fire.
What will the German government do when the Germans protest against the incoming Islamists?
And the Muslims will come to help, long living in Germany, but certainly not in love in order to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans, following fear of Islamization?
What will this do with the Germans, and even Germany, when the people who will rise up loudly and publicly protest against the new Euro-rural Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict that has created in Europe the promotion of a solar ideology, an ideology of elite and, in principle, totalitarian, and its dissatisfaction banks, is growing.
And because of its infallible conduct against the unobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and unobedient Eastern neighbours, this cannot be done well.
Finishing tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the founding vendors is to scare them to death.
Just knock and the robust knocked on you in a huge way that the weaker nature may not just stand.
The living head will take you down pretty well, and it will take you to go away (or, rather, to take away) the needy seller and the living statue.
Maybe it's a shame that a talking cage can't be handled in reality.
Even with us, we could use a lot of junk and shit.
Cod (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates the dry environment.
And so it's between the outdoor tiles near my place of residence.
On 16 September 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to expansional weeds, but looks like a pleasant impression on flowering.
The outdoor tiles are located.
She's unquestionable, she's in our garden.
She likes a dry environment, easily adaptable, modest and non-fatty.
Sce creates leaves with a chaotic composition, but it is worth watching and taking more pictures.
Under the microscreen there is only a beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves with also purple escort.
Brazilian Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet during breast feeding
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS came in a shocking way to try to make women aware of the importance of good diet when breast-feeding using a picture of children who were breast-painted by showing unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which supply to infants all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Due to energy requirements, pregnant women and newlywed mothers are recommended to increase daily calorie income by 500 calories per day.
However, new surveys suggest that an increased intake of calories is not the only dietary measure that should be followed by mothers.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced their children's genetic production and protected them from tumour development.
Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that unhealthy diets have negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the Sabbaths, although Nine's trying to take charge in Today Show
With Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry, due to the cost for the consequences of the liberal leadership leak, it was not possible to create a sufficient increase in the rating for Today.
Nine's morning show shown from national capital after being thrown away by Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise and host David Koch and Samantha Armytage are stuck in London as a part of a week's long series of international television broadcasts including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem that the distance of Aussie TV to viewers was so important because it recorded 397 000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330 000 broadcast audiences Today.
Today, it recorded a smaller increase in its assessment compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was up to last Thursday (343 000).
Today has been filling the Sunris gap in recent months.
In August, on average, on Saturday, 318 000 were on average compared to 330 000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has 349 000 viewers on average and 314 000 today.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The wind changes affect more than just Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are well, thank you for asking!

The great news for Seven was a stunning debut of 800 words with former star Packed to the Raffers Erik Thomson.
A new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand has on average very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critices considered whether Thomson could pull a TV hit without Rafters Rebecca Gibney's star.
Last night's result says "yes."
The X Factor from Seven has left strong 1.136 million viewers, and has slowly defeated The Block (838 000) and TBL Familias (726 000)
Seven recorded a mixed observation of the second night The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30) that introduced Andrew O'Keefe had on average 446 000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623 000 viewers — enough to win a little over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday night, she had the first half of The Chase Australia averaged 520 000 viewers and the second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Due to the decline in The Chase Australia's second night, Nine will be convinced that the Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which could not defeat McGuir's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect kid, but who will he choose?
Secrets revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may be reluctant to find out who wins Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes up with on Bachelor is wrapped in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who stand still will certainly not reveal who is the one who gets the rose eventually.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before they were left just two, thanklessly told us who to win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until the fourth finale
All three women were singing lyricky, why Wood was the perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positiveness as the reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, which gets Wood's final flower?" they could work as a consorter for whoever gets Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would be best suited to Wood besides them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared a very easy relationship from one day forward.
"Since I entered the house and watched Sarah and Sam's energy, I felt that they were very compatible and I still think so during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a real country woman, she has a lot of fun," she added Markoski.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They're fine together and pleasant.
Sarah Mackay thinks that Sam Wood and I could make a nice couple.
She claims for herself that during his last visits home, she realized that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is no longer a game, "I opened my whole heart to him," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if she didn't, she looked mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can tell," she said.
I like both girls anyway - it's between Sneezene and Lana inadvertently.
Bachalor's on Wednesday at 7:30 to Ten.

Jaryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after they moved to the United States and many teams questioned after his great start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some of the trainers sat down Hayne for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which he made the conversion of the Australian Rugbi League at first kick from the pitch at Tuesday's win at 20:3 in Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and take him to the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also still honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of eating newbies before the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, declared that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and to take care of just another game.
Already during the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne fixed his mistake.
I'm sure it wasn't the start that Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for at his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught in broadcasting when he left the field after a mistake and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 worse start of career in NFL he couldn't even imagine.
"That happens, you just focus on the next game and that's all," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trap to its original debut in 2007 when the recording in its own goaltender territory led to three Queensand.
Overall, it was a great experience for 27-year-old players.
Hayne posted photos with fans held after the Australian flag game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Rus Vladimir Putin will meet in discussions on homosexual rights
In 2003, the richest man of Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested by gunmen on the Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts were limited.
US became emigrants who were allowed to replace the property.
Two were emigrated in 1984 and their property was won by a new owner.
After 1989, the property could no longer be returned, so the couple turned to the State for compensation under the Law on Non-Security Rehabilitations.
The Court first assigned them the required amount, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, of appeal, but their claim was changed by admitting only less than 90 000 crowns with reference to the amount of the refund being determined according to the 1991 price rules.
The Emigrants were replaced by the Supreme Court, and they were initially charged with the defendant's amount.
The Ministry of Finance, which had the money to pay, however, turned to complaints about the US.
In the meantime, there was a change in the social and economic ratios that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at that time – if it represented an adequate compensation in relation to the remunerated property - today it is only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the burden of side participants as in the restitution of entitled persons who have been in favour of their rights for at least since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to grant a refund earlier," explained the judge Jaroslav Fenyk, why ÚS stood on the side of the immigrants.
"The US has repeatedly spoken to the general courts of restitutional matters in order that any non-consistencies should not be interpreted in failures of justified persons, and that the purpose of the restitutional legislation, i.e. the restitution of property harm caused by acts of the previous totalitarian state, should always be achieved," the judge added.
Evat in the musical studio DVA currently production Radka Fišarová.
By the way, Radka Fišar became the world's youngest Evit when in 1998, in her 20s, she represented the wife of Argentinian dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague Theatre Spirala.
To return to the same role says, "Evita's complexity has not been equal to much of the performance."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
As first lady of Argentina, Monika Absolon recommended her.
I've seen monchu three times in Evita, and it was definitely inspiring for me.
Here I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I am a fan of more modern modifications, but this one is just particularly leading.
"The director Ondřej Sokola is original, lightened and current," says Fišarová.
The intention of handing out a musical Jell-O between the two divers will take place at Monika Absononna's birthday concert, September 27th, at Studio DVA's theatre.
In the evening, they will culminate in compositions from the musical Evita.
There will certainly be a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Be quiet, Argentina!).
In the limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also jump away from the director's counter when he plays for Charles Roden's film as President of Peby.
For the public's sake, further dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech study of the world musical Evita presents Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London has been successful since February 2015.
In the director of Ondřej Sokol the main female role was originally studied by Monika Absolon.
On her side, Karel Roden appears as President Perón and as the role of Che Peter Strenačik.
Legendary songs from the work of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with the Czech texts by Michael Prostějovský are in the presentation of a live orchestra led by Kryštof Mark, who participated in the first stage in the Spiral Theatre.
4 people were killed after the cops were shooting rubber projected for protestors in Nepal.
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police were designing rubber pieces in a crowd of protesters against the draft new state constitution, said in the middle of an official.
There was violence on Tuesday night in Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of Kathmand City.
Bishna Prasad Dhakal, Head of District Officer, reports that more than 1000 protestors gathered in front of the police station and some threw stones and burning bombs.
Mr. Dhakal states that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they got caught with rubber designs.
Twenty police officers and five civilians have been injured, reports.
It was not immediately clear why rubber designs, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This conflict was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the Southern Plain of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say they set up a new province under the proposed new constitution and mitigated their political influence.
Other demonstrations in West Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which requires the creation of its own state.
From August 10th, at least 40 people, including 11 policemen, have been killed in violent conflicts.
where four major political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into province — a big step towards the new constitution, but a very controversial question in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been maintaining since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the destructive earthquakes that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted in Kathmanda this week on the provisions of the draft constitution and officials say that the new charter should be accepted until Sunday.
We must definitely not panic now.
After the heat on the ice of the Master's Lithuania, you didn't even handle the home duel with the Spartan hockey team (3:5).
Don't you worry about the similar catastrophic entry into the extraliga as a year ago?
I hope nothing like that happens.

NHC predicts the 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide-ranging low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern Cape Verden islands is likely 60 percent in the emergence of a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday the National Hurricane Center of America.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about the middle between Cape Verde and Small Antilles also has 60 percent probability of developing tropical cycle formations in the next two days, added the weather forecast based in Miami.
Google launched a campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees.
Google Inc (GOGL.O) stated that it is launching a campaign aimed at selecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded the European states in the run from the war of rejected and poor countries.
Google announced this on his blog a very unusual way.
A report on her blog was published by Googlu Rita Masoudová on the basis of personal experience, as a seven-year-old man with her family from Kabul.
“We traveled in many dark trains and buses, and we experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,” said Masourov.
I was lucky.
But more and more families, such as mine, are willing to help with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe.
All contributions will be divided between 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: doctors without borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that all contributions made through the google.com/refugeerelief page will double up to $5,5 million.
Europe is facing the greatest wave of refugees from World War II, most of them coming from Syria, being thrown out of Syria by a four-year war that was only spent this year on 4 million people.
Many people also flee from the war of rejected Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

A useful weight loss surgery could be useful for mild occlusive diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss of surgery for mild tying people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too soon to tell whether minorly those with type 2 diabetes may live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are provided with non-rurgical treatment.
"The data on mortality lasts a long time to view," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an introduction to a new study of JAMA surgery.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgery use different methods to reduce the stomach.
Reduce the hunger and limitations of the human body absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric operations have proved to be effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey has been conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the ratio of height-dependent weights, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicate overweight of a person and people with a value above 30 are considered obsessive.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan have used data collected from the study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrostrectomy - in the treatment procedures of type 3 diabetes in people who have been slightly obsessive.
The average BMI among those who performed the operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 according to the study at the end of their fifth year.
In the meantime, BMI remained those who did not receive diabetes surgery, approximately the same as those of 29.
Diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and in 28 cases.
In the treatment-treated group, only 1 percent of patients were completely resolved for comparison of diabetes and partly for approximately 2 percent of patients.
In addition, blood pressure control, trigylcerids and "bad" LDL cholesterol was demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers also monitored the patient's level of haemoglobin of A1c in the blood, which reflects the continuous blood sugar level in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7 percent, reports researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin of A1c decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the treatment-treated group, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glyemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrostrectomy group (18.7 against 14.2 kg), achieved higher BMI declines (7.4 against 5.1) and A1c (3.1% vs 2.1 percent) and had a greater probability of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent vs 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence of a study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, the people who performed the bariatric surgery had about 29 percent greater chance of survival over the next 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival between patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, it is a comforting result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Just here, this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group," she states without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after the patient's BMI has dropped between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long for people to show the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once these genetic changes are accumulated, which will closely link their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is really heavy.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to take all refugees, said Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan leader of Buddhists called for the end of violence in refugee countries.
Dalai Lama deals with the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech opening the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which deals with an ethical study, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He argued that under present circumstances the interest of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the answer of the Western European countries, however admirable, was inadequate for the refugee crisis in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama endorsed the efforts of Germany and Austria in the resolution of the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"A few thousand refugees are wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force never solved these problems," he added.
When dealing with violence issues, Dalai Lama also expressed his views on the action against George Bush after 9/11 a terrorist attack, claiming that "the violence of the United States caused a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter from President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent road.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength and created unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have had an ambulance in the last four years
The Toxicologic Centre around the United States reported nearly 400 % increase from 2010 in the number of children up to 12 years of age, which swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitary agent, according to the Toxicology Centre in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Toxicology Centre, the number of use of ambulances for children up to 12 years of age reported at the control centres increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"The children get to these products more often and, unfortunately, there is a percentage of children who must be transported to the emergency," Lopez CNN said.
Some children drink the sanitary equipment intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge to social media.
Your YouTube videos show you how teens drink the ambulance because of cheap habits.
The Nazis reportedly mixed an ambulance with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to an attractive scent.
"The children don't think that it might hurt them," said Lopez.
A lot of more attractive (salitative means) are those that are perfumed.
Dioces are sanitary equipment with smells of strawberries, nitrogen or oranges, which are very attractive for children.
The vaccine contains between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in young children, several beds may mean alcohol poisoning.
"One of the highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City Medical Director of Control Toxicology at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't just let the whiskey harvest as much as you do, but people leave these health care tools out there, and if the kids get to them, it's a fast way to drink alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently died in school with up to four deposits of sanitary agent with scented strawberries and was transported to the emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah spoke out loud and was unable to walk after she arrived on the alert.
Doctors were monitoring her overnight at a separate hospital for any signs of brain trauma because her girlfriend fell and hit her head because of alcohol, reports Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, mother of Nhaijah.
Could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to arrange for the sanitary resources from the reach of children.
In spite of alcohol poisoning, some sanitary devices have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontaria died after the swallowing of the sanitary device, which contained toxic, undeclared ingredients.
Medical professionals thought that the product contains methanol, mortal, rather than ethanol, which was given as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth year in North New York planned to poison their "bad" teachers by deployment of antibacterial products in the room," according to police report.
The teacher is very allergic to ambulances and has forbidden their presence in the room.
The police judged a misguided plan as "invincible clutter," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Fáma: No consistency in the Celtic team
Griffiths bagates the talk of a crime in Celtic, while Delia admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he turns it again.
Hearts will fight SFA against the hit on Neilson and Warburton are concerned that the new January reinforcements will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons boost your head above Celtic by 5 points
Penalta of the first half in the submission of ADAMA Rooney provided Aberdeen with a close victory over Hamilton in Pittsburgh, which made Dons a five-point lead between her and Celtic.
Griffiths denied the talk of non-compliance
This situation has caused gossip about non-compliance in Celtic, which has been denied Griffiths, which insists that he and his teammates do not work under any pressure from the increased supervision in the preparation for the fight against the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish title rivalry bored by the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers reserve and former Dutch representative Ronald de Boer claims that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador to Ajax, says: "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic's games, and why?"
Because there are no Rangers anymore.
People here don't just talk about returning Rangers.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
At the matches of the Old Company there is great tension and not only people from Scotland are watching these games.
I'm going to turn things back to the good, and they're going to commit to Gail.
ROONY Delia admitted that Celtic was a bit stumbling, but the Norwegian boss pledged to turn things back to good.
The defeat of Malm and the following fall from the League of Masters was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now stands at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Delail says, "Celtic has already lived a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really upset or sad about the current happening.
We're all the same - but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic's support because it makes players much better.
It's very important to stay together now.
Warburton's worried about the January reinforcements.
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago and indicated that he had already identified some of his ice targets, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is worried about the great shopping of reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unit of the Ibrox team.
Former chief of Brentford says, "The London transfer window is very different from the summer window."
Players who come in summer have all the premonition period for housing, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more damage arises by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Celtic Michu's transfer target suggests retirement
Attacker Swansea Michu, who was associated with Celtic in the transmissive window, indicated that he could retire after his contract had expired with Swansea.
A 20-year-old shooter has had trouble with his susceptible ankle for two years and couldn't find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the locker room and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - it is the third red card issued by Judge Collum who was appealed.
Neilson stands up for his statement and says: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on the performance."
Griffiths committed to avoiding Tynecastleu
The hard-headed Hibbe was strictly punished after he admitted that he sang a song with a text aimed for the former Hearts Rudolf Rock player.
The incident took place in a pub in Roserburn, Edinburgh before Edinburgh's derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was derby, and it was a won moment," the attacker said and continues: "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle if it is not in Celtic's dressing."
The Tanadica Council believes in the Dundee United - Donelly procedure
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United Council still believes in correcting the situation with the team's current management - but admits that the fall in the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the boys for action again," promises Donnelly.
MCInnes likes to be "a bad win" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to be desperate to hold against Hamilton Accies in order to get the seventh league win together and a five-point head start before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the penal from the first half of Adam Rooney's submission.
McInnes says, "There's no team who won anything, no matter what cup or league, without winning this kind of fight."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged while UK overall unemployment is rising
INSTALLATION in Scotland remains unchanged to the number of 164 000 in the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10 000 to 1,82 million over the same period.
The rate of Scottish unemployment was 5.9 percent over UK (5.5 percent), as shown by the National Statistics Authority (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over a period of three months, the number of workers has now stopped to 2,612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 75.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the British average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of the State of Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
This is almost exactly the year Scotland has made historic decisions to stay part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment have grown, while unemployment has fallen.
Why was I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will follow the death of a man.
If that happens, and I hope that this doesn't happen, I'll sit in an inspection gallery at the death chamber of Oklahoma's state prison, and I'll see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of four officers who would witness his death.
I received the invitation first in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I'm starting to worry about it.
Why am I doing this then?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than open seats, there are morbid lottery that decides who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will follow all execution uninhabited.
I can't do that.
I'll sit by the side of Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a special bond for him over the months of phone calls and one-and-a-half hours of visitation.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a note block and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
One journalist in Oklahoma accused me of Twitter compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the breeder as he speaks to it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could formulate better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glosip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could take me out of the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist who is ready to tell the story in place.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help with the procedure against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To learn more about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts I created.
I won't repeat all the details again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His crimes after the murder of Barry Van Trees would've made him guilty of his involvement in a crime of crime.
But I believe there's a great probability that he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that there was no sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is bad.
And from this perspective, I will follow his death.
I can't say I'm gonna be really objective.
To this end, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the man I love die of unnecessary death.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he took the men out of Canning River.
The betting of a man from Petra who ran away from the police did not come out after he got into the shallow mudwater only metres from a police officer who tried to misguide him to go back to the shore.
Canning Vale P.D. was summoned at an incident exceeding Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get them out of the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I will not go out, just come and get me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to wet his uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic, and that's police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they run away," Castledine said.
The Ben Cousins Football Champion gives a memorable example.
In 2006 Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid the bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning a biathlon Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody says the organizers tried to spy on him and threaten to end the race.
Peeter Moody accused the organizer of Racing Victoria that they tried to get a spy last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He focused on the organizer and department of the integrity of Racing Victoria and came from the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with late scratching Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidarin's positive coat of cobalt that can't explain.
He bit into his tongue about espionage charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you at once," said Moody.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight, and I'm gonna sleep well.
I want to walk my head up and make the owners think I'm doing the best for them.
If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm gonna do with my license.
Previously, Moody released in his interview for racing.com the bomb that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"For 18 months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man, whom I will call after the question - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out information about the things that are being done in my stables," said Moody to Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because in an attempt to catch me, they've completely burned down.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of RVL, was aware of that at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's going to be personal?
Does RVL grow up a few balls and make people outside the coach position take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will provide them with material to think about.
But I got into a point when I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will press them, and I will carry a burden upon them to make decisions.
I have my family's support, and I can leave.
The levels of frustration of the coach increased with long-term investigations due to cobalt including Lidari and the recent scratches in it made it feel that "it could be hours of its license on the table."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of the undefeated Black Caviar champion, marked the rule of treatment on the day of the race for "murder" after the horse has been applied to the legs clay lining or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against racing rules.
I must take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put a mud on his leg.
He could've had it last night.
It could've happened yesterday, and it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treatment of observations on the day of the race to which the organizers have already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need the rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.
The Cobram driver who ran off was arrested.
The police arrested the man who hit a biker on a weekend in Cobram and drove away after the collision.
The biker was air transported to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley's main road on Saturday morning.
The police said the motorist left without stopping and helping a wounded rider.
On Monday, a 50 - year - old man from Nathalia admitted himself to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected that he will be charged with an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic violations.
Cyclist, 40-year-old Cobra man, remains stable in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy's coach is returning the hit to the rivals for the wrestling claim.
Craig Bellamy, Coach Melbourne Storm, criticized the actions of his players as "the setting up of the plan" by two NRL fans of the Prime Ministership.
Trent Robinson, coach of Sydney Roosters, said the referee allowed the Storm to punish his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team in Sydney final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly covered note on Strorm after his team won the qualification final over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game "view" Rugby league and according to him two of Queensland were not "too big" to wrestling.
Bellamy fought back his players and said that during them they focused on "intervention."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his confidence because his team was criticized by two coach leaders, which may mean that they are afraid of defeating the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and techniques in the last year, we've just put emphasis on contact during surgery, and that meant a turning point for us.
Trent's been here for three years, and he's obviously been training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how these things always come to this part of the year.
Bellamy underestimated Bennet's idea of "distorting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetov's team St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premier by playing "stupid" football in 2010.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right about his Saturday game as exciting as ours. It was also as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said that he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game that seems disturbing to him, especially his young backuprs with their speed.
Such football you would like to play if you had this type of player at your disposal.
He said this in 2010 and now he wants all the teams to play his football style - but not every team has two backups like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play such a style.
It gives me more confidence because they say such things because they're worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big fights.
Bellamy also referred to the fact that in the game Storm and Roosters, more goals fell than in the Broncos and Cowboys game.
Broncos team game was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game were two more attempts, but is it exciting football?
Or are the breaks and the non-squeaking of temptations interesting?
I think they're agendas.
If they mention us, it means we'll meet again at a certain stage.
Storm has a break this weekend and they won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary finale next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man has bailed on $20,000 for drug charges
A man who faced possible life for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine, who was smuggled from Queensland, got bail of $20,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years) was one of the five men who arrested the federal police last month looking for 100 kilograms of drugs from the yacht of Solay, who came from South America through Vanuatu and stuck in Coomer in August.
Maksimovic was spotted when he met with the accused in the harbor during the morning and later met with them at the Coomer Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential life sentence for owning a cocaine commercial quality, his lawyer Maksimovice built a defense that there was no evidence that he owned the entire amount and that he could be at the coffee shop by chance and innocently.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, believed that Maksimov had escaped.
She's got a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of a court.
In the Crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Mother and stepfather Maksimovice together offered a bail of USD 200,000 for his release.
"After reading the sworn statements of both persons, it is clear that the bail of USD 200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their efforts were obviously insufficient because the accused did not come further to court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on condition that he gives up both Australian and Serbian passports daily will report to the police and follow the curfew from 18 hours to 6am.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
Pedofil used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get photos of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the phone girl when she was asleep, then applied to her online chat site, where he had a lot of inappropriate photos of kids who sent him another user.
The girl then woke up and found out that she was missing a phone and then found him in Hogg's hand.
She went through it, and before she alerted her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police got involved and saw five photographs, then the analytical computers found the address, and discovered the "nervous" search on the web using expressions to look for immoral pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed that his reason was "to bring pedophiles on the internet" before "supplying that they were a police officer and scared."
Fiscal deputy Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was addictive - that he was addicted to the scary of people.
He admitted that his computer search was done by him, but he says he just wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send another one.
He thinks he was doing it to lure them.
He says he's gone off drunk and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When a girl found messages on her phone, he called his mother, shaking and crying.
She saw the immoral pictures on her phone and the defendant was confronted afterwards.
The girl was heard and talked about how the defendant used her computer and PlayStation to talk to girls that looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted guilty of bringing an action in respect of the adoption or provision of inappropriate images of children on 14 June of the last year, violated the conditions of bail on 25 January and failed to be heard in court on 24 March this year.
Gregor Sim's attorney asked that Hogg not be placed on the list of sexual delinquents, because he can argue that in his crime he was not "no major sexual context."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael dismissed the judgment in October to report to social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing of other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual delinquents before the date of his judgment.
Zmbabowski Robert Mugabe gave a bad speech to Parliament
Mr Mugabe, the African oldest leader, had previously fallen on the steps leading to the stage.
He wasn't injured, but the video of his fall became virtual in social media.
The opening of Parliament was also defiled by opposition legislators that they received an anonymous threat to the killing that warned them against Mr Mugabe's denial during his speech.
Last month, they scolded him and provoked him during his speech about the state of the nation in Parliament - the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Chairman of the Members' Club Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Incent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians adopted text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to defend Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from numbers that will not be displayed, but is named 'Death'," he told the journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in Parliament and as soon as they step out of Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is not working.
The chief said that the party that Morgan Tsvangirai was running has a "goods" regarding threats to Members.
Hewlett-Packard is about to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancel 25 000 to 30,000 jobs in its efforts to restructure and save the costs of business services of the company.
HP will be divided into two stock companies later this year and separate the computer and printer trade from its faster growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change in the range of around $2.7 billion and will start in the fourth quarter, reported in HP's statement.
"This restructuring work will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable expenditure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, Director-General of HP, and Chairman of the Board, who will be the head of the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than it is today HP and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of trades that will help businesses transition to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the emerging requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will send a statement of annual income to the company over $50 billion and "will be aimed at providing non-competitive integrated technological solutions" to the company.
This will be the distribution of the company, founded by Bill Hewlett, Bill Hewlett, and Dave Packard graduates, producing electrical equipment in Palo Alto, whose garage was renamed "Silicon Valley" in 1930.
HP was undergoing a massive reorganization to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move to HP, the second largest manufacturer of PC and one of America's largest technical companies, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a closely specialized company has better results.
Captain Mikel Arteta says the teammates need to get behind the wounded Jack Wilshere in front of Dinamo Zagreb.
Wenger also stressed for Wilsher that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason for him not to play again on Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least another four English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next summer European Championship is obviously uncertain.
A great damage to this new problem is that Wilshere ended the last season strongly after the injuries of the ankle and then returned to the former form during the presidium.
"This kind of injury does not threaten career," says Wenger.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of other injuries, whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant formula.
The examination by Prime Minister Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilsher wounds since he had his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he's only played 65 league matches for Arsenal from a total of 157:
From a wider perspective for Arsenal, it means that at six out of eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs who lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the enchanted circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes you go back after the injury, you have an vulnerable period, the time you need to strengthen your body and get a competition", says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get out of this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will, and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in Liza champions at Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to turn his team around.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta would probably come.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcotta.
"I try to maintain balance and let the players who need it breathe out," says Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite of the F group, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after the last season held the campaign "invincible".
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake of 3.2 degrees Richter at Wednesday night.
That was already the following year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks Arsenal learned from the last season of the League of Champions when he capitalized against Monaco and remains distant from his hope that he will lead the club to the first win in the European Cup.
"This attitude is huge," says Wenger.
It never happened to Arsenal.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I must be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy show that gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The lack of similar views in different shows is beating in the eyes, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever in terms of suicide between young men up to 15 years.
In 2013, it was the only cause of death in men aged 20-45 in Great Britain and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked Campaign Living Miserably (CALM) of 2015 as the Year of Men, whose aim is to question a culture that prevents men from finding help if necessary.
In the heart of this fight lies a friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students showing signs of depression found that in case the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends is half a chance to develop mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, of course, it must be reachable first.
In this communication through social media with emphasis on style and not on communication content, immediate response is often preferred before meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a deep influence on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game creator explained recently, he really doesn't buy more luck.
The beauty of the Friends series was the source of this thought for him.
None of the characters have been defined by their work, but by their personalities that have brightened through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler are frequenting victims, watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all comes from knowing that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they usually keep their feelings for themselves.
as one Samaritan worker explained to me: "My role as listeners of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies has really confirmed that even the least friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel inability to communicate with their friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the shows that will come to mind when I try to offer a longer-term compensation mechanism.
It highlights little moments in male friendship.
As for my task, the status of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from greater proximity, from a network of friends and families.
So if you're going to the FrendsFest, set up by Comedy Central, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior for the occasion will be completely reworked.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and greet him.
You never know the difference your friendship can make.
Friends' series will be broadcast at Comedy Central station from start to end - complete 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG to drive Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidi and Edinson Cavanim after shooting the goal against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored during his debut in Liza Masters and helped PSG beat the Swedish team on Tuesday.
Here's the report on the match and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edison Cavani scored both on Tuesday and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in Liza Masters with the ultimate comfortable victory of 2-0 against Malma at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Liza Masters, and this PSG player sent French champions for victory, but then they threw several chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani shot the head goal in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shahktar Donetsk are also in group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against Swedish champions, because they are not only focusing on qualification in elimination rounds, but on improving their journey to the quarterfinals that have been recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they got three points, it wasn't the classic performance of Laurent Blanc and Zlatan Ibrahimovic's team was futile before the goal, and later he was stoned against his home team and the club where he began his famous career in 1999.
"In the Liza Masters, it is not easy to win outdoors or at home, so win 2-0 makes our opponents problems and look comfortable in defense is a good start, although there are things that we will have to improve in the process of the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury as one of the three changes to the PSG team, who had spent 2-2 on the house this weekend with Bordeaux in Lize 1, but was screened by Di Mario in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian wing was marked as a man who would shift PSG in Europe to a new level after the transition from Manchester United, which ran last month, and showed why when he ran into Marc Verratti's belt behind Malma's defense and a beautiful ending he sent the ball behind Johan Wilanda's back into the distant corner of the goal.
However, if someone expected it to start a spectacular victory PSG, he had to be disappointed.
The Malmo that beat Celtic in the playoffs and got into this stage, joined with 9 internationals in the basic assembly and five defenders and two overtooked backups were a heavy opponent.
But besides the missiles Nikola Djurdjice, which just missed the far-off corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in 34 minutes, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves discussed the benefits of attacking wrong matches and miserable endings, which were neither good nor from Ibrahimovice, which could shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shooting arrived shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavanni.
However, he showed up much more appropriate when he came to prepare the chances for his teammates and it was from his passover when Di Maria sent a shooting shot that ended up in Highland’s goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of the game thanks to Cavanima, this Uruguayn head sent behind the line the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic played by the player from the left wing of Maxwell.
This ended with all the ideas of Malma about the possibility that they might have won something out of the match, and only Wilanda's extraordinary intervention from a great proximity to the hope of David Luize and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of Ezequiel Lavezzi's shooting goal was not recognized at the end of the fight.
The coach of the Malmo Age Hareide team admitted that PSG were about the class above his team, Nor said: "Our last game in Liza Masters took place last December."
We've only played Swedish league since then, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches aren't enough.
A hat down for Paris.
It was an amazing game for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion for sale of shares
The Glencore mining giant, based in Switzerland, which was hit by commodity price collapse, earned $2.5 billion on Wednesday from the stock sale within its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in its statement that it sold new shares worth around £1.6 billion to pay the debt.
This company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is dealing with commodity price easing, as China's slowdown in the economy reduces demand and devours the sparks of scrapes across the markets.
The issue of rights was sent by Glencore to the top of London’s stock market in early-morning shops at the center of the Glencore stock price.
Stocks jumped by 2.77 percent at 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of $2.5 billion shares is part of wider plans to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares in the price of 123pence per share, which marked a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
So 1.3 billion shares in the total price of 9,99 percent per group were removed.
Concerning the extension of Chinese growth, the price of iron ore decreased by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirms Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in his Tuesday report.
The first visit of President Xi in Washington will take place on 25 September in the reaction of Barack Obama to visit Beijing, where the President visited in November, reported.
American President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his husband Peng Liyuan to a state dinner that will take place after the end of the talks.
"The visit of President Xi is an opportunity to strengthen the relations between the US and China and to cooperate in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the differences between the two States," he adds.
Xi, whose first visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several technical leaders of the United States on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at the UN's Light Meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to deal with disputed problems, including Washington's fear of alleged China cyber-spionage and its growing aggression in the waters of the South Chinese Sea.
How the refugee crisis spread Schengen space.
The emergency lights fired by Germany almost did not include the European crew, but already forcing the ship to change course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
On Monday, the European Union has decided to deal with the refugee problem: it will instead systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece - rather than argue for future distribution of refugees according to quotas on the basis of the number that is increasingly devoid of reality.
Six days after President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to split 160 000 refugees, they changed the priorities of Member States' internal ministers.
Before taking care of the final destination of the runners, first we need to filter those who arrive today and solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effect management of the EU external borders is essential for managing migration," stressed the text of the ministers discussed on Monday in Brussels.
Following the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds that it is at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increases the pressure.
It renews border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in this country.
Central power makes it clear that without it there is no free movement in Europe possible.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia have already joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, although with different intensitys.
Hungary has moved on a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen rules.
It's a dominal effect, but it's blind as well.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry checks in Greece, southern Italy, as well as in Hungary for those who have already passed to the interior.
The French Minister of the Interior Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière were working intensively on this during a private interview with three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new at all, but there is tension.
In Italy two-thirds of new arrivals of runners were already registered and identified by the unofficial statistics.
The Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point in its territory, because it is afraid more than others, so that there will not be camps on its boards where refugees would be gathered on its account.
The real black hole remains Greece.
More than 200,000 people landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, which is twice as many as arrived in Italy recently.
Most of them are actual asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after they passed over crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge living hole.
Athens, which are still in a financial break, and which wait for the new government, put their hands in the lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan trip and source of the common concerns for the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The Juncker Commission promises that the entry of the checkpoints will take place as soon as possible, but it has shown no number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to all of Europe," said EU ministers on Monday to mobilization on this front.
The aim is therefore to deploy European Border Control Agency teams in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum reception and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"The need for adequate financial resources," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
In terms of law, Athens will continue to have the last word.
The issue of the creation of genuine European border guards was not officially raised, but Europe is approaching it.
The new emergency situation of the octopus, as well as the second round, raised the question of binding quotas and 160 000 refugees, which had already been established at the beginning of the year by Juncker Commission and the European Parliament, which strongly supported Angela Merkel and French President Français Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still don't want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
Number, not duty, was maintained on Monday in a text approved by most osmeals.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only strong promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, which has already been reached in June during the Hectic EU summit, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, apparently three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists that killed the avalanche in the French Alps.
German nationality is also a woman who survived the eight-member group as one of the disabled.
Previous media reports say it's about Poland.
Some 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with severe leg injury in the area of femoral bone.
According to AFP, the dead formed mostly forty-four.
"The security action ended, also the victim's bodies were transferred to Briancon," explained Hautes-Alpes Pierre Besnard.
Unfortunately, it happened around noon in Pelvoux mountain area below the top of Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The lavina was about 250 meters wide and about a meter high," noted Nicolas Colomboani, chief of rescuers.
At an altitude of about 3900 metres, the eight-member group said that the vast amount of snow was hot.
Today, the weather service did not warn in the area of adverse weather.
Trestisov before the game with Brago: Finally, the right Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpisovský, in his cup premiere, managed to go through the European League forefathers and now he enjoys the right Europe with the team.
Sloven to the opening of the main stage of the competition welcomes the finalist from 2011 Brag and according to coach wants to force her play style.
After all the nerves in evasive battles where every goal and every situation could take you off on your way to a dream group, now we're there and we're playing six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal we've got, we can play our tactics, and we're not just bound by a two-pack.
"I look forward to this and it is a true Europe, before it was only a qualification," Mr Trnisovský said at the press conference.
Braga considers the team top.
It will be very active, they have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The match may be harder, even if it does not have such a name, but it has a player in his hand who gave three goals to Manchester.
"It's an excellent whole at top team level," Trypisovský said.
But he doesn't consider Brag to be a clear favorite.
I take it we're playing at home, so I'm sure we're not outsiders.
"I think we have also shown in our home competition in the preschools that we are strong at our stadium," said the coach whose team lost from the eleven duels of this season only the initial Superpohrar in Pilsen.
He believes that Liberec even Braze can force his style.
We have a team waiting for us to be strong on the ball, and at the same time it's too unusual for them to be disciplined.
They play 4-4-2 with a rapid transition to the attack phase.
"He's a very tough opponent, we've discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing is how our players can do it on the field," Drypisovský said.
In the past we have studied a lot of opponents, which has helped us very much, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted the training.
"And we definitely want it to be very difficult to play according to our notes," he added.
Student films will be controlled by Písek, an international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries this year submitted their works to the competition of the 15th International Festival of Student Films in Písek.
Four tens of them, which the commission composed of students and educators sent to the finale, will speak from 15 to 18 October in the cinema Portyč.
The best of them choose an international jury, said the spokesperson of the Jakub Charvat Festival.
Every year, the festival has its special theme, which comes from festival sounds.
She's a detective this year.
Richard Blumenfeld is planning to combine elements of television, film and theatre production.
"And of course, we also need to solve the crime that was committed in this year's inception," Charvat said.
Visitors will see the choice of the most interesting of student works - movies played, animated and documentary.
They will be valued by an international jury, to which, for example, the winner of the last year, director of Milas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
Festival organizers as each year prepare an accompanying program.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional player at the Dedgeridoo Ondřej Smeykal, turbošanson group Let us fly, play band Zrní or for example Petra Hapková with recitation Life at the bar.
The festival will host two exhibitions of photographs.
The first will bring the graduate of the film school and the holder of prestigious awards, including the World Press Photo 2014, Jan Ašenbrenner.
The second exhibition will draw closer to the atmosphere, which reigned in Nepal after a tragic earthquake.
The cameraman and documentary writer Martin Čech will be present at the meeting with the visitors, the silent film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber and the song parents of Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of Jan Novotný’s sculptor baptized his new book of 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříček, a patron of the FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and the festival are his legacy, which will live on.
"The young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint ties and film crafts," the speaker said.
This will certainly help Pitching forum, where students can meet film professionals, attend several job auditions at once and get a job position.
The festival is associated with the creation of Private higher vocational film school in Písek.
Her founders, married to Vladana and Miloň Terčov, organized their first year in 1997.
He spent every two years in the sixth year.
In case of bankruptcy, the insurance companies are obliged to fully pay the claims of the clients.
Insurance companies should pay their client's claims when the travel agents fail in full.
It was decided in the centre of the House when it approved an amended amendment to the Act on Business Conditions in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able, according to a front to assess the Senate, to replace insurance against the bankruptcy of a bank guarantee.
Insurance companies with the obligation to pay clients' claims and the agreed limit disagrees.
The Ministry of Local Development insists on adjusting, arguing that consumers are protected.
Insurance companies have already threatened to stop insuranceing travel agencies against the crash when the amendment is paid.
But the proposal also criticizes travel agents.
Without insurance, they will either have to quit or go abroad.
The Minister for Local Development Karla Šlechtová (ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not Eurocomform.
She pointed out this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client was entitled to a full refund, regardless of the limit of insurance.
Insurance companies will receive enough information on the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the right limit, highlighted Šlecht.
"We appreciate the efforts to increase consumer protection, but must have such a limit to be realistic," said TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank guarantee won't work because no one's going to give it unlimited.
"The Travel Offices will have to end their activities or move abroad," warned Kalousek.
Member of the presidium Association of Czech travel agencies and agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) with Kaloussk concerns on the basis of a survey between Member States of the CK.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurancemen," he said.
The investigation of the insurance company does not consider Okamura relevant, no official written observations in that respect exist.
They say they find out if travel agents will be involved, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jan Fischerová (ODS) also warned before the provision, which referred to the opinion of the competing Association of Travel Offices of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who talked about lubricating the stairs to Czech travel agencies.
Fischer's travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," says Fischer.
Her motion to release the disputed passages of the House did not approve.
He did not include Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) with the proposal to return the draft to the Committee for alleged violation of civil law.
Filip drew attention to travel agencies that he believed could threaten the consumer.
The report of Martin Berdychová (ANO) in view of the verdict of the Constitutional Court has withdrawn its proposal that would limit insurance liability in cases where they could not know that insurance transactions will not cover the entire risk.
In the amendment, the minimum four millionth limit of insurance for travel agents that offer flights by air transport will not initially be proposed and the millionth limit for the sales agents, such as bus tours.
The border stays at 30 percent of planned tours sales.
However, the limit for insurance transactions will have to be such that, in the event of a failure, the travel agency will cover all claims of the customer.
The standard, even after adjustment, provides that travel agencies will have to introduce, for sold tours, which travel agency organizes.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies before the conclusion of the contract, inter alia, information on the management and number of tours.
The approved amendment of the Committee for Public Administration also includes further regular information of insurance companies.
Travel agents will have to supply them with data every month on the number of passengers and on sold tours, the total price of sold tours and the amount of advance and check-ins and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds out that the travel agency has not fulfilled any of the legal obligations relating to the insurance company, it shall invite it, according to the reference to the revision or may prohibit it from concluding a new contract in the event of a breach of the obligation, to compromise the customer's interests.
The amendment also has new modifications to the financing of mountain services.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the grant of the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the following year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money last year, a financial plan of expenditure and a outlook for the next two years.
According to the Association, the predecessor of the law did not figure out what would happen if the insurance company had signed the contract.
It will not be able to organize tours and clients who have purchased the tour prior to termination of the insurance, so they will lose it according to the Association.
In such a case, CK will suffer significant losses and may even decline although its management was in good condition.
One of the ways that travel agents can cope with this situation will be the case for compensation.
Another option will be going abroad and using much softer conditions abroad, and in our market we will then act only as agencies, said the vice-president of the Jan Papaž Association.
Although the draft amendment also includes an institution of bank guarantee, it is not in fact possible to implement it in practice at all, because the bank guarantee cannot sound to an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the Association, the change in practice is unnecessary.
In the two-year horizon, the whole law will need to be recast in view of the new EU Directive.
In the Czech market there are now 942 active insured travel agencies.
This year only three CKs ended their activities.
Domestic travel agencies will sell daily tours worth approximately CZK 20 billion.
Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must take a position on improving humanitarian conditions at refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to reduce the arrival of runners to Europe.
It was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after dealing with German Earth premieres.
At the same time, it again appealed to the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU, among the Member States of the eight-year-olds.
We must help countries from where refugees leave, or where they refrain from leaving their homeland.
I am expecting a signal from the European Union that we are focusing on decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, by a German chancellery that could give such a signal to higher financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
"The Polish countries also support the German Government to promote a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to the European countries," Merkel said.
The Earth Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke said in this context at the press conference that he expects genuine solidarity from all EU countries.
The distribution of runners in the EU on the basis of long-term quotas rejects, inter alia, the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke were also invited to speed up asylum proceedings in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start with the integration of foreigners, so that they can quickly speak to the presiding Prime Minister.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of runners serve to integrate those who have a chance to obtain asylum.
More teachers will need to be able to handle German refugees.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if runners can integrate, they can benefit us, he said.
Matt Damon bagates the diversity in the movie
Matt Damon confronted the African-American Effie Brown film maker during a discussion on direness, claiming that this was not necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of the HBO project Greenlight, the actor occupied the Brown series when she stressed the need for alternative views about black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about direness, you do it by making a film and not by taking the show”, says Damon.
Shocked, responded humiliated Brown with distrust and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments on the Martians got posted.
Damon and Brown joined together with a well-known producer named Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I would like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they will behave to the nature of Harmony," Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character who's a hooker who's packing a white pimp.
The producer of the Drahých White People promoted the finalists of Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to direct the film; Damon figured out that their director-in-law "that eventually she could give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was sent out, the social media exploded in failure to comment by Damon.
The user Twitter MrPooni expressed his anger about writing a clip, "Mattt Damon jumped into the language one black girl in the room, so he can explain to her that direness is TAK BÍLÁ that it hurts when it hurts."
Tweet has gained more than 5000 retweets and 4000 foxes since it was published.
Damon's comment comes when accurate racial representation in the media is at the front of social discussion.
After being killed by a teenager Michael Brown, a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained a national effect and pushed the creator of laws and authority to refrain from discriminating practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince made an impact on the movement while he quoted nominated for the album of the year during the Grammy awards.
"Alba are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered as a hate group.
"Black Lives Mather Network is a love group," the leaders said.
Damon was recently reported on the list of entertainers, producers and mogul media, who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the view of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether the invitation was accepted or already met by the Pope, it is not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior Has First Winner"
The professional climber and pickup Isaac Caldiro became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday and take home one million dollars.
In the competition that just ended its seventh season, none of the contestants managed to overcome all the obstacles to the track.
During the finals of this season, two men fought through the final round, Caldioro and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second spy for more than 220 m long rope.
Britten was the first climber in the set limit, and he became the first contestant in the American Ninja Warrior overcame the force of the 4th section, but Caldiero overcame it for three seconds and won the competition.
Caldioro provided an interview for the newsE! News immediately after his hard-earned victory and it was aware that he was still in shock of winning the main prize worth $1 million.
“It is an amazing feeling, I have never done more than $10,000 a year in my life” said Isaac E! in response to my winnings.
"So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it's like right now."
The executive producer Kent Weed provided an interview to the magazine The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the finals and about why Britten won't receive any reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to finish the track.
Under the rules, money belongs to those who complete the track as quickly as possible.
"If the track is taking part in more contestants, the winner will win the best time," said Weed.
Although the profit of the main prize would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
“I don’t think he has a grudge in himself.
He's glad he managed to achieve what he did.
He got warm reception from fans.
He's a great guy, and he likes his family.
He's a hero to his children and women."
Geoff said to me: “If there was anyone who could have defeated me, I’m glad it was Isaac.
And I think if I win, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season to start filming in spring 2016.
Tigers from Detroit passed just around Minnesota Twins
MINNEPOLIS -- The second half of the season was not just a walk in the pink garden for the Detroit tigers.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is now located at the last location of the Central division of the American League.
They just turned back the Tigers in their defeat when they beat Minessot on Tuesday with a close result of 5-4 at the Target Field stadium.
The twins wasted a chance to approach Houston Astros and throw away a second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which was so insignificant for them during the second half of the season.
"The winner is always fun and it doesn't matter how," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
The Tiger Alfredo Simon kept his offensive entrance and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took another in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponents 6 1/3 of the hit and 3 halves.
It was his only third lead game from the last nine games.
"This year I want to end with convincing results," Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a fight when you often sit on a bench and that’s why I want to get in a good game.”
Victor Martinez's battor hit three times, and he did two rounds and his first download point since mid August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point match since the last June game in which he hit four times in the match against Seattle Marines.
"He's got a good turn," Ausmus said.
“He looked good at training, fired off significantly better and managed to transfer it to the game.”
With three rounds at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins got the best chance of returning back to the game.
The Middle Pole Byron Buxton got a shift thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
The right polar Aaron Hicks got a point thanks to his set bat and Simon eliminated Brian Dozier before replacing him with Blaine Hardy's left.
Hardy eliminated his only rival Mauer and before him he had Miguel San's batter, who hit the ball and ran two mets and left behind Drew VerHagen's right-hand.
With two meth players and chancers on the draw in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send the third base over two mets.
Plouffe has already gained 27 circumference over two mets in this season and reigns league table.
Detroit kept his ninth shift, Mauer got two old points, and Bruce Rondon secured a score of 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right handman has knocked out Sana on three odds.
Detroit took advantage and won points at Phil Hughes' game.
Tigers gained three collars in the first two shifts against a trained rightman who entered the game after more than a month's pause due to inflammation of the back muscles.
"I certainly did not imagine such a start," Hughes said, "but during the third shift, I felt I was able to pitch better."
After resisting the first shift, Hughes released one point to the second metre of Ian Kinsler.
Two exits for the J.D. Martinez's right-wing polarion brought up Victor Martinez, who was the first to run all the finishes.
Victor Martinez interrupted his 0-21 series.
The third metatar Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the playground and scored the next round, but Victor Martinez was thrown when he tried to catch up on the third finish.
Tigers added in the second shift when the pitcher James McCann and the leader Anthony Gose won two points and the resulting score 3-0.
“It got us to the knees,” said Paul Molitor's Twin Manager.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it to the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of pitches, ended up on the third shift without a point and replaced him with right-wing A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran off three bases, got six sets and 4 strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right tiger pitcher, ended the match with pain in the right shoulder.
Dr. James Andrews will take care of him, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been on the list of injured muscles in his shoulder since mid- August, should be in the middle game.
The Sanchez will replace Daniel Norris, left-handed, who will return after the injury and appear against the Twins.
Since June 30th, when Norris was traded behind the left pitcher David Price, he has a score of 1-1 after 4 matches.
However, since August 20, he hasn't played for his muscle yet.
Tigers and Twins will play the third game in Target Field stadium on Wednesday.
The Minnesota left pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) will be built against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA).
Xi calls to open the economy to a wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to a wider world to boost growth, said President Xi Jinping to a group whose task is Tuesday's reform of governance.
"The China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policy," said the Central Head of the Group on 16th meeting to deepen the overall reform.
The promotion of opening new impetus and vitality during the emerging reforms will also provide new space for economic growth, says Xi.
The governing group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory approaches to the market, the release of border control policy, the support of state enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and reorganisation of the registration resident system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are outside the limits for investment.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is significant because it will provide a greater role for the market in the allocation of resources, ensuring the legal business environment and making the market more open, making declarations.
The government will also release control of the powers it delegates to companies and ensure that companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In order to open up a State-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies financed from abroad and will provide them with better services," the statement states.
Moreover, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a residence permit or a 'green card' thanks to optimization of requirements and simplification of the application process.
The rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and representatives of Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as announced after the meeting.
A new bed department may arise in the Karlovy Vary Region.
According to the Deputy Commander of the Karlovar region, Jakub Wukka (ČSSD) is the current capacity of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region, sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between separations of individual hospitals.
There are possibilities in the region to expand care.
For example, at the department of surgery, the centres of one-day surgery could be created, where performances of surgical branches that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours, according to the concept set.
In which particular hospitals the workplace should be, so far, not clear.
In the skin department of the hospital Karlovy Vary, a laser center with the possibility of using laser techniques for skin disease.
The concept also recommended the emergence of an apalic centre that would take care of patients with brain impairment who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiology-resuscitation department.
There is also a possibility to concentrate such a facility into the hospital Ostrov where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovar region, is a bed of follow-up care, especially a bed of Léčeben in the long-term patients (LDN), whose capacity in Nádka is insufficient and should be closely related to acute bed care.
Part of this device should function as a bed of rehabilitation and part as a classic LDN bed, recommend concept.
As he points out, the bed after care is missing mainly in the hospital of Karlovy Vary.
There, they could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovar Region there are social health beds with a view to treating Alzheimer’s disease.
These beds are a lack throughout the country, so they could serve for other countries as so-called Alzheimer'scent.
Hospitals should also prepare themselves for the introduction of so-called binding beds to be mobilised by European subsidy funds, as recommended.
"One of the beds that will bind to the fields of specialised care and will create space for translation of patients after surgery, for example, with cardiosurgical, neurosurgical, transplanting or other surgery," describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
