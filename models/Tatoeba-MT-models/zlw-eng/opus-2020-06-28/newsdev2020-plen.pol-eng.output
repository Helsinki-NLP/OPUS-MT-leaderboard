Bosnia and Herzegovina protests on Croatia's plans for the landfill of radioactive waste
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in Northwestern Bosnia in protest against Croatia's neighbouring plans to store part of the waste from the only nuclear power region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known for its natural beauty.
Demonstrations in the Bośniac town of Novi Grad demanded Croatia to reject waste storage plans in former military departments in the town of Trgovska Gora and declared a fight against the project.
There would be waste from Kruško nuclear power plant in the facility.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, keeping banners with the inscriptions “I want a healthy future” and “Stop – (judgment) Una needs us”, said that radioactive waste storage could threaten the rivers of the Union and the lives of about 250 000 inhabitants.
We have to say no,
said to the crowd Miroslav Drljac, the mayor of Novi Grad.
We need to fight to protect our way of life and our Una.
In Slovenia, the Krka power plant built in the 1980s also belongs to Croatia.
Representatives of both countries are expected to meet next week to discuss additional landfills.
On Friday, the Croatian public television show that Croatia has not yet decided whether to build a landfill alone or to pay for the storage of parts of the waste in a new building designed by Slovenia.
The Croatian Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told journalists that Croatia also has a problem with the improvement of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia's activists, officials and residents on each side of the country's ethnic division insisted that Croatia find another location in a part of the country closer to the power plant.
“Why is Croatia in all of her area claiming that Trgovska Gora is the best place in Bosnia?” Drljac asked.
We can't let them down!

American Congress agreed to sell 32 F-35 aircraft to Poland
U.S. Congress 15 days after the Department of State approved a possible purchase by Poland of 32 multi-stakeholder F-35 did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The Congress decision, although unexpected, is of great political importance.
"After the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I see no major obstacles," said John V. Venable, Senior Defence Policy Councillor, Washington's conservative think tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that under the 1976 Broni Export Control Act, the federal government, represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned sale of arms abroad to 15 days before signing the contract, if the value of such a transaction, in the case of the sale of weapons to NATO, exceeds 50 million dollars.
The value of the proposed purchase transaction of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at 6.5 billion down. This amount includes costs of technical and logistics assistance, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of aircraft F-35 – if this transaction is finally finalised - will be the US arms company Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the engine manufacturer for the F-35A fighters Pratt and Whitney company.
The proposals for the purchase of the 5th generation F-35 American fighters on behalf of the Polish authorities were submitted by Minister of Defence Mariusz Błaszczak in May.
Poland's offer was discussed in June this year at the meeting of President Andrzej Duda with President Donald Trump in the White House.
The implementation of this agreement, if finalised, will be ensured by representatives of the Pentagon in the framework of the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
In the framework of FMS, Poland has already acquired an anti-rural system of Patriot.
The price of one fighter F-35 at the time of Poland's offer of purchase was – without weapons and technical assistance – about 89.2 million dollars.
As the US military experts informed them, who wanted to maintain anonymity, the price given in the preliminary negotiations was “the maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated.”
“Prices fall rapidly, currently the price of one F-35 is below 80 million dollars, much less than the Eurofighter, which is not the advantage of F-35,” pointed out Venable.
The PAP speakers expressed their hope that Poland’s final negotiations for the purchase of American combat aircraft will end this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – offset – will be discussed directly with the US producers of F-35 fighters.
What is the replacement team of Münchhausen, referred to in the "Payton Hobart Selection" series on Netflix?
The caregivers and parents with this disorder show that their healthy child is ill.
The Payton Hobart series will be on Netflix platform today.
It tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to become president of the United States of America, but first, he needs to be president of the student government at his high school.
In the Ryan Murphy series, the American Horror Story and Glee series, we'll see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boyton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet had a chance to see the series, it addresses the topic of the replacement Münchhausen team, a mental illness with carers, who act as if a healthy person who has been affected by physical or mental illness.
There are different types of these conditions, such as the Münchhausen syndrome, which consists of the symptoms of the disease.
The replacement team of Münchhausen is to simulate that the person who remains under our care has some problems.
It's also called a imaginary and induced disease, and it's treated as violence against a child.
This is a rare condition that usually involves the parent of an overabsorbing symptoms or causing symptoms, so that it looks like his child is ill.
What are the symptoms of Münchhausen's replacement team?
The symptoms may vary, but NHS draws attention to the following examples of behaviour:
Realising medical personnel that a healthy child feels sick, however.
Extend or invent symptoms.
Falsifying results for the child to be considered sick, such as administration of glucose to urine samples, to make it seem that the child has diabetes.
Causes symptoms of disease, e.g. by giving children unnecessary medicines and other substances.
How often is Münchhausen's replacement team?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disturbance occurs because many cases of disease are not reported.
A study published in 2000 indicates that over two years there have been 89 cases of this disorder in 100,000 people.
What should we do if there is a suspicion that a child may be in danger?
Contact the local Special Service Unit or call NSPCC Child Protection Information Centre, selecting the number 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid in Kadun, evacuation of 300 children
Kaduna – State Police Station in Kaduna conducted a raid last night at Imam Ahmad Bn Hambal School, located in Layin Maidbun Tsumma in Riga, Igabi Municipal Area, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police said that children were in highly dehumanizing conditions, and the school authorities deny that claim.
“ They don’t tell the truth, because all the children were there with the permission of their parents.
My parents signed a form before they were kids at school.
Every day parents brought food to their children and knew the conditions under which they were.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of children, as well as by removing all the food from the students delivered by the parents before the school closed.
It's not right, because parents can testify whether their children are in bad conditions, as the police claim.
He added that former Commissioner Abdulrahman, who had visited school once to check out the level of child care, had never had any objections.
€€Twittered that children were studying Koran and nothing else.
However, the Public Relations Police Officer Yakubu Sabo considered that they would join their parents after the transfer of the State of Children.
‘Třimano is under dehumanizing conditions on behalf of the submission or acquisition of Korean knowledge.
A lot of them had scars on their back, which proves it was a battle.
That's why we're studying school to meet the owner," he added.

Siemoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Błońska will be president
"I see that Donald Tusk and Malgorzata Kidawa-Błońska have the chance to win the election with President Andrzej Duda", says Tomasz Siemoniak.
Vice-President of the Civil Platform Tomasz Siemoniak spoke to Polsat News about the offer with the participation of the head of the NIC.
“This case is disqualified for Marian Banasia.
He may become a minister of culture from some sort of entertainment matter, not the head of the NIC, or the Minister of Finance.
Not someone responsible for billions, taxes," he said.
"This is a very serious state crisis," he added.
He also talked about the candidate Klaudii Jachira.
“The PiS lists include Antoni Macireewicz.
A man who wasn't just saying things, he was just doing them.
He judged former SKW heads of spying for Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why doesn't anyone ask that Antoni Macierewicz be on the leaves?" he asked.
“ People have different aesthetics from us.
I think that Jachira, who for one of her things has already apologized, has sometimes been exaggerating.
Let's not make it a campaign problem," he added.

"Blessed" masked child rapist from Central Coast forced to look at his victim in court
Dressed in masking man caught a 12-year-old boy from behind and dragged her into a dense grow in Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to a tree and raped her.
Soon after the arrest, a search warrant was executed in his home, where officers held a number of vital items for the investigation.
A man admitted to guilt for seven assault charges and for three more cases relating to the belief and sexual exploitation of another girl, aged 11, between August 2016 and August 2017.
The 12-year-old victim was walking along the path, and when she looked behind herself, she saw how he suddenly left the bushes armed with a large branch and a knife.
When she begged “stop, stop, stop,” he grabbed her neck and forced her to enter the ants.
The man said: “Sic, don’t scream.
Don't shout because I'm gonna have to hurt you."
While holding a knife in her right hand, he tied her hands and legs with cable belts, and then tied her to a tree and raped her for almost an hour.
When he cut her off, the girl ran off to school with a historical scream.
The man arrived at work about 9.30, not responding to several texts and connections from his colleagues.
His clothes were dirty and she wore traces of grass and trees, and he claimed to be involved in an attack of rage on the road, during which he chased another driver in the bushes and fell off the road.
There will be a follow-up hearing on Tuesday.
The Pope calls on the Executive Directors of Technology Companies to use artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned the executive directors of technological companies, diplomats and financiers that the creation of artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievement poses a threat to increasing social inequalities if, in terms of ethics, the good of common interest is not taken into account.
Pope Francis gave these words during the Vatican conference, where he participated in governments and representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference “The Common Good in the Digital Age”.
This three-day event is the latest proof that the Vatican is interested in the debate on the prospects and risks of artificial intelligence.
There was a discussion of technological developments in martial arts and the future of work, which would give rise to the role of machines, as well as a study of the case of Christchurch bombings in New Zealand and decisions taken by companies owned by social media owners in connection with the spread of the recording film.
During his speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that machines were saved from dangerous and monotonous work by means of the early industrial revolution.
However, he warned that the increasing dependence on labour equipment in order to gain profits was a risk of depriving people of the dignity arising from work.
"If technological progress would result in ever more visible inequalities, this would not be real and real" – he warned.
If the so-called technological progress of mankind would become an enemy of the common good, it would lead to an undesirable reverse of some type of barbarism under the most powerful law.
The organizers of the conference expressed hope to take advantage of the expert knowledge of participants and to identify possible future advisers of the Catholic Church on high technology issues.
Martin Odegaard, a loaned player from Realu Madrid, puts fans in euphoria his effective assist.
Martin Odgaard recorded an impressive assist in opening Mikela Oyarabal's goal.
At 2:0 with Osauna, Real Madrid climbed up to the top of La League and continues to be disturbed at his own field this year.
However, despite not only one failure this season in La Liga Zinedine Zidane, it is under great pressure due to the stormy pre-zone period and the public fight with the Welsh star, Gareth Bale.
The situation was reached when Real Madrid was humiliated in the Masters League by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid, however, have real talent – they currently have plans to do with some of them.
Vicicius Júnior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madrid and currently plays in the band.
However, the Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard, who was rented to Real Sociedad, caused a great move, including the incredible assist in La Ligi.
During the meeting, Real Sociedad of Alaves Martin Odegaard performed an impressive assist at opening the hall of Mikela Oyarzabal and Real Sociedad finally won 3-0 in front of his own audience.
After picking up the ball from the right hand side, Martin Odegaard made the player out of the opposite team by betting the net, and then sent him an amazing pass on the centimetres between two other players and his teammate only to raise his leg.
The second goal of Willian Jose and the third in the performance of the amazing Oyarzabal, this time with the penalty shot, provided a decisive victory for Imanola's support before Manu Garcia was sent out of the field five minutes before the game ended.
Martin Odgaard joined Realu Madrid just as a 16-year-old in 2015, but had difficulty trying to meet the expectations of fans.
Now, at the age of 20, the Norwegian football player finally seems to feel like it's on the field.

"ED will find out where his name came from in the matter" said Anna Hazare, a multiple participant in the demonstration against corruption.
Sharad Pawar refuses to accept criminal action and claims that he was in no way linked to the bank, as well as raises the question of the fact that the case was filed for several weeks before the 21st October elections of the Maharash Assembly.

Mylan agreed to pay $30 million as part of an agreement related to the lack of investor notification about the Department of Justice’s investigation on a possible demand for too high in the Medicaid programme for EpiPen.
The Securities and Exchange Commission concluded on Friday that Mylan NV has qualified EpiPen as ‘generic’ medicines in the Medicaid drug return programme.

Is this the punishment of God?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysms, severe illness, child death.
These are dramas that cause a great deal of suffering and it's hard to understand them.
We ask, "Why?"
Sometimes we also hear that “God wanted to do so”.
Does the Creator send us bad luck and sickness?
John Paul II suffered greatly at the end of his life
When Nick Vujic was born 36 years ago, his dad ran out of the room with fear.
"My son has no arms or legs!", he yelled at a doctor.
My parents didn't know their baby was suffering from an incurable disease that took off their limbs.
At first, they couldn't accept the boy.
But they prayed and after four months, Nick's mother felt that God had a plan for their child.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Today, Vujecic is a world-famous evangelizer and motivational speaker that brings many people back.

“ When suffering affects us, it is difficult to understand.
We're looking for reasons.
We ask: «Why did this happen to us?».
If we believe that God prevails over the whole world and guides our lives, there is naturally a question whether he has sent us sickness, calamity...".

"As a result of the campaign of written lies, I have a lawsuit against Caesar Gmyza", said Mr P. Krzysztof Brejz on Twitter.
The appeal is caused by the public address of Caesar Gmyz in the program “Liave 20” on TVP.
One of the leading people in SokekzBuraka is Krzysztof Brejza, who has extensive experience in the organisation of the hate department.
“The people that know Marius Kozak-Zagodza – the founder of the “hejterski” profile – this is Kierziński, Budka and Giertych,” said Gmyz.
SokzBuraka is a site and social profile with mines and policy jokes.
As the “Sieci” reports, the PR Mariusz Kozak-Zagadz is behind the profile of this title.
"We learned that since April April, Mariusz Kozak-Zadost is employed at the Warsaw City Office, in the marketing office", wrote a week.
“Confession” in Olawa
At the Oláwi Fair Square, he organised a "Confederation" electoral committee.
Their program was presented by Krzysztof Szokalski number 5 on the list, and Halszka Bielecka number 9.
The anonymous leader of Krzysztof Tuduj's letter failed to reach the election rally.
The candidate has raised many problems – from excessive fiscalisation to health problems.
The economic area, which should work for all entrepreneurs, has also been raised and should not favour foreign capital.
Climate change in Budapest – World
Several thousand people, mostly young, took part in a climate strike in Budapest’s capital on Friday.
The government called for climate neutrality, announced the state of the climate and led to a more environmentally friendly policy.
The participants of the strike went from Clark Square to Buda's side to Kossuth Square before Parliament on the Swedish side.
The scan was: “What do we want?
Climate protection!
When do we want to?
Now!"
Boris Johnson addressed to the police supervisory authority in connection with the close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The IOPC's independent police procedure office will examine the possibility of initiating an investigation with the prime minister whether, during the public administration, the mayor of London committed abuse of criminal offences.
The Council of Great London (GLA) stated that its supervisor registered a ‘consistent question’ of the prime minister’ in connection with the allegations of the preferential treatment of Arcuri resulting from a combination of their close knowledge.
“The question of the case” can be said when information indicating the possibility of a criminal offence appears” – he said.
It doesn't mean that somehow it was proved.
The IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to examine this case.
The issue is addressed to IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of police services in England and Wales.
It was referred to by the police supervisory authority because Johnson then held a position as equivalent to the Commissioner and Commissioner for Criminal Affairs.
Johnson denied any irregularities due to his close relationship with Arcuri.
He had said that he would comply with the order of the London City Council and provide details of his relationship with Arcuri, but insisted that the board would "group with the wrong problem".
The warrant follows the report "The Sunday Times", that Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, received £16,000 from budget money, and privileged access to three foreign trade missions, which were the first to become Mayor Johnson.
As a result, the government has frozen a grant of £100,000 for Arcuri for Hacker House.
The government expects troublesome questions about the verification procedure carried out prior to the grant of the funds.
Minister of Digitalisation Matt Warman said in the House of Commons that the staff of his department “have usually maintained due diligence” and that the company has a British telephone number.
However, according to numerous reports of connection to the number, they were transferred to the California office, where they currently live on 34-year-old Arcuri.
The Prime Minister's close account with a businessman was "a secret to the police staff".
The GLA's decision to refer the case to the IOPC's independent police procedure office met with dissatisfaction at 10 Downing Street.
According to sources from an environment of a higher rank, the government representative is "politically motivated attack", and its term is "exceptably political".
"The Supervisory Officer has not provided any evidence of the allegations and the Prime Minister has not been given an opportunity to reply to him prior to the publication of the press release late Friday," said the source.
Neither citizens nor the media can get into such an open political bill.
Today in earlier hours, journalists said that a close relationship between Johnson and a businessman from California, who was helped by the tourism and promotion agency in London, was for workers a "consumer secret".
The employees of the London & Partners (L&P) were put above, reminding that Arcuri received seats during Johnson's foreign trade trips as mayor despite the fact that her companies were not “perceptible”.
Third defendant for drug offenses in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELS (AP) – Due to the death of rapper Mac Miller last year as a result of drug overdose, a third man was arrested and charged with drug offences.
According to court documents, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills treated with fentanyl, which Miller had in possession prior to death in September last year as a result of accidental cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl overdose, or a strong opioid responsible for “epidemia”, which has absorbed several thousand human existence in the United States.
Walter's being accused of delivering pills that another man, Cameron Petit, sold to Miller.
Court records sealed on Tuesday reveal Petit's been receiving Walter's drugs all August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week at Lake Havasu City in Arizona, is suspected of being a "survivor" of Walter, who provided the pills to Petit.
None of these men were directly accused of causing Miller's death, nor did any of them provide a line of defence in their case.
Walter, subject to a conditional exemption in the 2005 drug case, is in custody, and he has already been convicted of imprisonment for five months in prison for violation of the conditions of release.
The prosecutors on the case first reported on Thursday on the web page dedicated to the celebrity TMZ require Walter to remain in custody pending the trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of escape from the defendant.
The answer to the message left on the automatic secretary of his lawyer did not come immediately.
Pettti was charged with the federal court on September 4, and his lawyer refused to comment.
The words of Miller's rhyming works are an honest talk about his depression and his use of drugs, making him fans of the biggest hip-hop stars.
From Pittsburgh Miller, who really was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, he stayed in connection with the singer Arian Grande, which was completed earlier in 2018.
After his death on Instagram, she published a touching film with Miller and the song "Thank U Next", which mentions him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been combined in recent years with the abuse of opioids.
Matthew Roberts, 3 Doors Down guitarist, also died of an overdose in 2016, and fentanyl and hydrocodone were found in his body.
This article introduces an amendment: the correct Walter's name is "Stephen" rather than "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates more than 30 games for mobile devices
9-year-old creates a game of play in hidden game using free Scratch 2 programming app.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
So far Basil has generated over 30 games for mobile devices through it.
There's a bat in today's game that's hiding according to the program.
The player gets a point every time he catches a bat that comes out of the safe.
I learned how to play games on an accelerated course.
"Now I create them when I'm bored," said Basil CNN.
In March, Dad wrote him on a five-day accelerated course for children aged between 5 and 15.
The course, organized by Codefest International, was intended to provide children like Basil, access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, claims Basil played a lot on mobile devices.
“ When he was four, I bought him a tablet because he always caught a phone and played it.
He played a lot at Candy Crush and Temple Run," said CNN's father.
But Basil's interest in creating games grew when he was 7 and received a whole time-playing burrow.
"One day he played the tablet, as usual, and he was so absorbed that I was upset," said his father.
Out of anger, I said, “You just play a game, can't you think about creating your own games so they can play other games?”
In saying these words, I was upset and I didn't think he would take them seriously," he added.
From then on, Basil showed an active interest in learning how to create his own games, commissioned his parents to buy a laptop and saved him for a course during which he learned the basis for creating games.
In the future, Basil, who wants to be a scientist, gives his numerous titles based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available in Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes the leadership of innovation in the continent.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds have recently been famous for using codes to create robots that separate their work at home.
In May, Acrobot won the Robofest 2019 Women's Average School in Ghana for programming robots for boxing.
And thanks to growing investments in technology such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and its peers are on the right path to the career of the stars.
Former President of the Republican Party in Northern Carolina will confess to the lie on corruption
On Friday, court documents show that the former President of the Republic of North Carolina admits that he lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of the main political donors.
According to Robin Hayes, he's to plead guilty next Wednesday.
The document containing the actual basis, prepared in the framework of the defense settlement and signed by the lawyer Hayes, shows that Hayes knew he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The Ombudsman's settlement has been sealed, and there is no real basis for Hayes' accusations to admit it.
Initially, he was accused of collusion, corruption, and false testimony.
The prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in the plan of the authorities of the insurance company to direct the campaign to the main insurance market controller in the country in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two partners were accused of trying to bribe Mr. Mike Caesary's State Insurance Commissioner.
Lindberg is the founder of the insurance and investment company, which has been one of the major state political donors, who has been giving more than $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He primarily supported the objectives and policies of the Republican Party, but he also gave donations to Democrats.
His lawyer did not reply to his Friday e-mail with a request for comment.
Hayes Kearns Davis' defense did not reply to the Friday e-mail with a request for comment.
On Friday, court documents show that Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he hadn't talked to Causey about employees of the State Insurance Department.
In fact, according to a document containing Hayes's actual basis, he talked to the Commissioner for Insurance about Mrs Lindberg's request to make changes to the staff employed by the market controller.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg arrange a meeting with Caesarey and that he was talking about a bribe directly with the regulator.
According to April's act of accusing Lindberg, he required special treatment for his insurance business and planned to transfer $2 million to Caesarey's renewed campaign in 2020.
It follows from the act of appeal that the request was made to amend the Department’s official control by Lindberg.
Former Republican Caesary reported an alleged attempted corruption to federal agents and helped them gather evidence about the case.
There was no charge for him.
According to the act of the charge, Lindberg's accomplice ordered Hayes to send it $20,000 to Caesary's campaign during the talks, where Lindberg and Caesary were also present.
During the conversation, Hayes initially protested, claiming that the transfer of such a amount of money would draw attention, but, as a result of the accusation, finally ceased.
"Whatever you all want to do, we will do so" said Hayes, according to the act of accusation.
"Okay, I'll take care of it."
The U.S. Attorney did not reply to an e-mail requesting further information on the settlement.

Our goal is the welfare state.
"We are building a state of prosperity in Poland", said Zbigniew Ziobro.
He came to Szczecin to vote on Councilman Darius Matecki, running for the Sejm from the Letter of Law and Justice.
"The programme of good change is the implementation of the Polish version of the welfare state" said the Minister.
“We want the Poles to make much better money to make their lives at a higher level.
This is necessary because otherwise young, dynamic, well educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford it.
For four years, our government has consistently implemented a program that has committed itself to perform four years ago.
We said we'd bring in 500 plus.
The platform, Donald Tusk and Eve Kopcz said it's impossible that the money just doesn't exist.
We proved that money was and was, only PO did not care about those to go to."
Ziobro also reminded of children’s and 13th pensions – and that 14th pensions are planned.
In addition to the "reasonable distribution of national income" priorities, PiS is a fair state and economic development.
The money should not only go into the pocket of the chosen people who have good relationships with the establishment and power, but should equally reach the whole society", said the politicians.

Facebook with concern for user well-being hides on trial numerator favorites
As part of the first experiment in the world, which aims to improve user well-being, some of the users of Facebook will soon not see the number of favorites, reactions and video views.
The favorites will be hidden and visible only for the post author, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar Instagram test in July.
The new Facebook version launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, director of Facebook privacy in Australia, said that the change is the result of a study on well-being and opinions of mental health professionals indicating that a number of favorites may be inclined to compare with others.
"The news from our cooperating many groups on the fight against harassment, as well as organisations in the field of mental health, was really positive," Garlick said.
Eliminating this counter will make people focus on the quality of their interaction and on the quality of content rather than on the number of favorites or reactions.
It is expected that sharing with others through the platform will be more enjoyable and will not be taken as competitive – she said.
Garlick has ensured that companies that rely on Facebook will continue to receive the same indicators and observations as they had had had access to.
She said it was too early to be able to tell if the test would be extended to other countries, as happened with Instagram, when the test included Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment is completed and whether the change will be permanently introduced.
"The users' initial comments on the new Instagram rules were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to the opinions," she said.
Speaking of the world's experiment sites, Garlick said Australia has very active, technically recognized Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an incredible country that will provide us with strong opinions indicating whether new experience is valuable to those using our services or not.
Common: The councils want compensation for pilgrims from the courier
For the time being, we do not comment on any appeal made by the councillors to that metropolitan area of Wacław Depo for the transfer of financial compensation for the operation of the waste management during the pilgrimage season.
The city asks for 1 zł from the pilgrim.
On Friday, he talked about the metropolis of the speech at a press conference involving, among others, the leader of Spring Robert Biedronia, organized to the leading point of the Jasna Góra Częstochowa alley of the Virgin Mary, Vice-President of the local council and candidate for Sejm Łukasz Kot.
The Kot announced that the day before the local councillor SLD voted an appeal to Wacław Depo for the transfer of one gold from every visitor to Czestochowa pilgrim – to support the work of urban, municipal services, etc.
We received an appeal to the archbishop Depo to help the city, to help us clean the pilgrims, to prepare the city for the pilgrims.
"We ask that you transfer to the city's budget a symbolic goldsmith from every pilgrim.
Thanks to this, the city will be able to provide them with better conditions of stay in Czestochowa", said the Vice-President of the City Council.
A spokesperson of the so-called "Mariusz Bakalzar" had initially prepared a few messages, but then asked, as he said, to replace it with information on the content: "We do not refer to the matter until we have received the official position of the City Council."
According to the project published on the web pages of the festival’s Magistrate, the appeal to Depo’s abpa concerns “transfer of financial compensation for cities Czestochowa for the operation of the system of management of municipal waste during the pilgrimage season”.
"With the growing number of pilgrims coming to Czestochowa and growing costs of managing municipal waste in the period of the pilgrimage season, bearing in mind the image of the city among residents, pilgrims and Fridays, we want a part of the overall adopted canyons to take care of our common good, the small home of Czestochowa, to propose a participation in the costs of serving the U.S. waste system", sounds a part of the appeal.
"In order to maintain in good condition the purity of pedestrian-driving trains, which are moving by pilgrims, using simultaneously small infrastructure, i.e. external waste baskets, we present an offer of symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system of PLN 1 from the pilgrim", written.
"In addition to the participation in the annual costs, which the city will cover from its own resources, taking care of the purity and aesthetics of urban space, and also in order to stress that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the sums will be allocated to improve tourism infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of public toilets available", the councillors declared.
They pointed out that, apart from the financial questions, their proposal stems from the many reservations raised by the people about the purity of the routes that pilgrims are moving.
"With regard to the purity of our city and the best possible positive effects of cooperation, the Częstochowa City Council calls for the archbishop of the Częstochowa Metropolitans Wacław Depo to provide financial compensation for cities The Czestochowy for the operation of municipal waste management system during the period of the pilgrimage season", repeated the appeal.
According to the press office of Jasna Góra, in 200 national pilgrimages, 834 thousand attended this sanctuary.
About 124 thousand faithful arrived in 255 pedestrian pilgrimages.
More than 8,8 thousand people came to Czestochowa in cycling pilgrimages (133 groups) and 440 (16 groups) in cross-country pilgrimages.
Not nearly 20 people reached the convention of the horse, and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups – on rolls.
The TVP left Confederation at the probe description
According to a study by Pollster, 45% of the votes, KO 26%, Leftca 14%, PSL 7%, and Confederation 5% would be obtained in the elections to Sejm PiS.
Even the "Super Express" portal for which the survey was conducted was written above the electoral threshold.
In the main issue of "Faith" by describing the same survey, only four first games were presented, completely ignoring the Confederation.
The leader Edyt Lewandowska clearly stressed that only four committees had exceeded the electoral threshold and would have entered the Sejm.
The TVP also showed the division of seismic mandates without taking account of the votes given to the Confederation.
It would give PiS the government itself.
Krzysztof Bosak commented on the whole situation about "public compatibility with society".
"They began with the slogan of 'moral revolution', he recalled and said that this case was a sign of weakness.
Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that “the TVP’s knowledge” in subsequent actions against the Confederate involve Urbana and Michnik.”
He also pointed out the lack of right-wing journalists' response.
“But let us also look at those who remain silent.
These “righteous”, “independent”, “uncircumcised”.
In a few years they became a more primitive version of everything they fought with," he added.

Brother sentenced to life sentence for murder of honorary social media star Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, which became a star with photos published on social networks, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of the Pakistani Social Media Star Qandeel Baloch was found guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to lifelong imprisonment for the loudest in this patriarchal country to be "citizens of honor."
The Baloch, which won the fame by publishing bold selfies – warm according to Western standards, but in a highly mizogin Pakistan considered provocative – was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseeem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that there was no conscience for his actions and stated that “of course” he murdered his sister and that her behaviour was “unacceptable.”
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood informed AFP that the court in the western city of Multan considered his client guilty and sentenced him to life in the long-awaited judgment.
"Inshallah (if God will allow), will be brought up by a court of higher instance," he said.
Back then, Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she hoped her son would be acquitted.
“He is innocent.
She was my daughter, and she's my son," she said.
Baloch's murder hit the fronts of the world's news service and resumed the call for action against the so-called honor killings in which the victims – usually women – are killed for breaking the patriarchal social rules.
Women were set on fire, strangled, shot or shredded for such misdeeds as their husband's choice or, as in Baloch's case, for bringing his family "institution" through the manifestation of his own sexuality.
Killings are usually done by a close relative.
According to the Pakistani law of Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (revet) they can ask the nearest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after Baloch's murder, Parliament adopted new legislation introducing a life sentence for honor killings.
However, whether murder will be considered an honorary offence remains a judge, which means that killers can theoretically rely on other motives and be evicted.
In the case of Baloch, her parents insisted at first that their son should in no way be shown favor.
However, the devastated ones think that they may also lose, change their mind, and claim that they want to evict it.
The international violence caused by murder led the Pakistani state to take a unprecedented step and to declare itself a heir along with his parents, thereby forcing the case to move forward.
One of the more famous performances of Baloch is to offer stripping before the Pakistani team of cricket and to establish a derailed purple dress in Valentine's Day.
She was criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, saw her as a breaking restriction in a country where the claim against Kim Kardashian could be considered a bold and political movement to strengthen women's position.
The root of "honor" killings lies in tribal social standards, which continue to dominate in South Asia, and in particular they normalise the behaviour of women, although men may also be victims.
They welcome to Niska for regatta

She's been singing for 10 years.

Anarchy doubles the number of displaced from northwest Nigeria to 40,000 UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations organization said that increasing violence has caused over the last four months to double the number of displaced persons from north-west Nigeria to about 40,000 people.
The United Nations Refugee Agency has stated that concerns have created a "new humanitarian situation", which requires an inter-agency effort to collect new funds of $35.5 million by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch, spokesperson of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic group Boko Haram, which has been leading the rise in the north of the country for decades, is not responsible for recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina observed in the last 10 months is rather the result of the activities of organised arms groups.
"This has a scary image of anarchy and uncertainty," he told journalists on Friday.
He informed of frequent reports of kidnapping, torture, extortion, murder and sexual assault from the assailants who also destroy houses and steal cattle.
Military and police have been sent to combat gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the army is separated from the battle of Boko Haram and the alienation of the Islamic State in West Africa, which separated from its former group in 2016.
"The refugees do not come with the names of groups," he said.
They come for it with terrible stories.
Most refugees go to neighboring Niger.
In his statement, UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that he would expect more people to flee to Niger in the coming months with a deteriorating safety situation, particularly in the state of Sokoto.
A new date has been set for the man accused of killing women and 2 children.
A new date of trial was planned for a woman from Guatemala who was accused of killing Iowa's apartment and two of her children.
According to the Polk District Court of Justice, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellan is accused of the first three murders, as the authorities claim, a false name, which was originally given to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't plead guilty.
According to the police, he killed a 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and her 5-year-old son on 16 July at their home in Des Moines.
The judicial file shows that the new date of the hearing, i.e. 27 January, will give the representatives of both parties more time to prepare.
The U.S. immigration and Customs officials claim Escobar-Orellana is residing illegally in the United States, and he has been deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was sentenced to enter the United States for illegal entry.
"The Sun": Boris Johnson, facing the rebellion of a cabinet wanting to lower demands on the UK and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Just three weeks before the final summit of the EU leaders among the most important people in the country’s environment, fear that there is not enough time for him to get more important concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a risk of rebellion from a cabinet that wants to lower demands for a brixit and achieve a compromise with the EU.
The negotiations contained an impasse on a new customs system, which would replace Ireland's backstop mechanism, as Brussels has set out proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as "excellent".
The Korona ministers expect EU decision-makers, headed by the German head of Angela Merkel, to offer the criticised leader compromises in the form of a three-year time limit to implement the backstop mechanism at the last moment.
The Sun Journalists spoke with three different cabinet ministers, all of whom prepare to confront with the prime minister after the annual tour conference next week in Manchester.
They will request the prime minister to reject the "aggressive" strategy drawn up by his close advisor Dominik Cummings, consisting of attempts to apply bluff to the EU and threaten to leave the Union without an agreement and then to accept an offer made by him at the last moment by the Union.
One of the cabinet ministers identified the devastating verdict of the Supreme Court on Tuesday on Parliament’s suspension as a “warning signal” and added: “The only way to leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so under the agreement.
We will never defeat the arithmetic of the House of Commons, which works on our own.
The Prime Minister must now bend and accept what he can receive.
Aggression does not pay: it is obvious that Cummings' plan burned on a pan.
We can't fight so many fronts.
The second minister of the office has committed to hand over Johnson to try to push over the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresa May if everything else is not going to happen.
The Minister said: “If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to resubmit the agreement proposed by Theresa May in the House of Commons.”
It's time for her to be voted out, and everyone's really up to the end of the story.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, that's the end of Boris Johnson, and we're all done.
John Major told Boris Johnson he wouldn't take the negotiations seriously.
The former Minister of Tories said: “Prime Minister tells us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
But we don't see him sitting in Brussels working for her.
Instead, he is working with bulls in Scotland, checking eggs in Wales and fighting with citizens on the main streets of cities – all in the eyes of the world, as if the electoral campaign had been going on for good."
The Ombudsman admitted yesterday that the agreement was still distant, adding: “No one should have illusions: a very long way to ensure agreement.”
However, the Ombudsman also said that the Benna Act implementing the suspension of the bridge three months in the absence of an agreement "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: “There is no doubt that this law makes it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the Prime Minister and his colleagues are still trying to make progress.”
Mr Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where he will hold more discussions with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss the way the area works for all Ireland for food and feed.
A dog with no nose and no legs conquer Instagram.
Perfectly unperfective
Kundelek was supposed to be asleep.
However, it has succeeded in preventing this.
The bitch was transported from Romania to Britain by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The photo of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with a pet from the first sight.
"I initially had difficulty convincing my husband for adoption because we had three dogs," she said.
A woman decided to take care of her bitch until she was adopted.
Still no one reported.
“The fact that no one wanted her has made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate said.
Finally, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
“Our Bonnie is perfectly unprofessional.
We love her like she is, and if anyone doesn't like how she looks, it's his problem, not ours," the woman said.
Bonnie has become a social media star over time.
On Instagram, she's watching over 14 thousand interns.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that I would never make a career on television with the Glasgow accent
According to Lorraine Kelly, the TV bosses said that given the accent from Glasgow, she would never make careers as a presenter.
She mentioned her 35-year-old career in Kelly's television industry, 59, admitted that before her first performance on the screen, she felt “very upset. ”
"I was only 25 years old and I was very nervous," she said.
When I worked at BBC Scotland as a search and information specialist, the chief of chiefs said I would never succeed on TV by my accent from Glasgow.
I went to London to meet the TV team and watch the program's emissions before I took over duty at Glasgow's office.
I'll never forget an interview with Bette Davis' star Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly was a Scottish TV mailer in 1984, she began her career as a reporter for the local newspaper in East Kibride in Scotland.
Then she started running programs like "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak" to launch with her morning program "Loraine", which he took name from her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career will honor a special program, during which she will remember her best remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret of her long internship on TV is “passion and enthusiasm” and “trace”, adding: “It’s hard to work.
Be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programmes and be interested and interesting.
When she mentions media reports that touched her emotions, Kelly says that "very difficult" to her was the report of a hit in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families killed or wounded children are watching our live program from Dunblane the day after the horrible killing of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we spoke at her house for many hours.
The whole meeting took place quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, which I've been involved in.
She added that "extremely difficult" was an interview with Kate and Gerry McCanny shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that "really admires their strength and courage".
They have to deal with the pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and in addition to bearing the most violent comments of the internet troll.
I'm all with them.
The 35th anniversary program of Lorraine Kelly's work on TV will start at 8:30 on Monday 30th in ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of imprisonment
The senior government official claimed that Vice President Constantino Chiweng rejected the offer to take over President Robert Mugabe's dead president at the top point of the coup because he feared imprisonment to confirm the military takeover in November 2017.
As last week he reported, "The Zimbabwe Independent", Mugabe offered the Vice President Chiwenga to take over the presidency during his negotiations with the military in the framework of the coup.
However, a senior government official announced in social media that Chiwenga did not reject an offer of fear, but because he had gone through Mugabe's plan to use it to prove to the world leaders and the African Union (UA) that he had actually lost during the coup.
On the Twitter portal, which confirmed that the 37-year-old ruler of Zimbabwe wanted to transfer power to the Vice-President of Chiwenga, and not to President Emmett Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, who confirmed that he was a senior government official in the Presidency and Council of Ministers, said that there were intense negotiations at that time.
The state officials claimed that Mugabe contacted Chiweng through one of his envoyers when he realized that the power was getting out of his hands.
The mediation between the military authorities and the former president, according to a senior government official, three stages.
The official claimed that among the participants of the negotiations was President George Charamba, a person acting as head of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nheper and a clergyman representing the bishop of Roman Catholic Fidelis Mukonori.
Former Head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, has been another element since Mugabe sent him with a one-man mission to transfer the offer of the Chinese presidency, who was the head of the Zimbabwe Defence Force (SOZ).
A man whose after death was considered an icon of Africa even more than a life, was in vain seeking to condemn military action by UA, trying to persuade other African leaders to intervene.
President's offer, consisting of the deceased (Mugabe) to the then Chief of Defence Forces (SSO) Chiwenga, was not based on choice.
"It was a desperate act to save a situation which took a dangerously rapid pace by removing part of the deceased family," wrote an official (Jamwanda).
But there was also a bit of a political tempo, with which the deceased wanted to reverse the situation in a totally un diplomatic way.
It is sufficient to remind ourselves that the commanders have declared that they did not rebut and will not refute constitutional order, which would be the cause of their conflict with the U.A. position on the coups.
The deceased (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chiweng) would swallow the bait, suddenly stopping the claim of the leaders that they had not disarmed the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the UA, which, on the margin, continued to be highly confused by the whole situation and the way it fit into its theoretical taxonomy of turnings, would then have no other choice but to describe it as a turning, so the call to military intervention would be credible.
It was in such a spirit and with such extortion that offer was made.
The officials claimed that Mugabe made this move when he realized that defense forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said that Mugabe was forced to sign a letter of resignation after warning the Powerman that he was risking a linc in the Kaddafi style.
The military chiefs have told him they will not return the rifle against citizens if they move on to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same moment Mugabe had two desires, that is to save his family and prove that the army had taken over power", added the official.
The then SSO and the commanders were properly reading the assumptions.
The envoy (Gono) on which this desperate message was transmitted was understood – through a powerful metaphor – that the tiri veakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the section of the campus, i.e. the troops), we are not politicians or do not compete with each other at political level, claimed a higher political official.
State officials say that the military has notified military commanders in the area through the attaché in Zimbabwe that they have not intended to overthrow Mugabe, but to deal with the surrounding “criminists”.
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to re-enact Mnangaga to return from short exile in South Africa so that they could talk about transformation and success.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought assistance in the region.
The inhabitants of South Africa, a key part of the process – not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because then President Jacob Zuma was the president of Sadc – refused intervention, but clearly indicated that if the military invaded Mugabe, how many times he was scared in the background, the army of South Africa would immediately appear in Harare.
"This did not work because Putin and African leaders did not select this route," said the Independent.
China needs strong leadership or it will “damaged” as the policy document states.
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, otherwise the country will “fall” – said the government in the policy paper issued on Friday on the 70th anniversary of the creation of the People’s Republic.
The Chinese Government press office reported in the White Paper that the success of the country since the Communists took over 70 years ago has led them to party leadership.
China has a large area, they have complex national conditions, while there are rarely administrative difficulties.
The document mentions that without the uniform and strong force of the leaders of China, they will move towards division and disintegrating, which will be catastrophic for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long been using hard-arm policies in solving problems as regards the suppression of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying this need to maintain country stability.
President Jinping, President of Xi Jinping, who has been at the heart of the second anniversary of the world economy on Tuesday, since he took over office at the end of 2012, has further strengthened the parties' governments and imposed sanctions on those who can question the authority.
Xi also supervises the military modernisation programme, which ran out of balance with this region.
The document states that China does not seek to export its model of development or to import any foreign models only to peace, rather than to “hegemony”.
The Chinese don't have other hopes or world domination in their genes.
In modern times, China has been depressed by great powers, and wars and concerns have cut off a deep mark on them as a result of the suffering suffered; China will never give to others the suffering they have suffered.
China is concerned with this anniversary in uncertain times for a country caught in bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to the slowing economy, as well as anti-government protests in accordance with China’s Hong Kong.
The document says that China never "trades" their most important interests or allow anything to harm their sovereignty.
As regards the trade dispute with Washington, the document states that "the danger of trade wars and further increases in customs tariffs do not lead to problems being solved".
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete industry chain, a wide market location and a strong pace of economic development.
The document adds that "trade wars will never weaken it".
China is sure that they are able to face difficulties, to turn the crisis into new opportunities and to open a new world.
It was also added that the United States should reasonably look at China's development because China does not intend to question the position of the United States, nor do they want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and even less is likely to stop China from developing.
The reduction and weakening of other countries and the transfer of national misunderstandings abroad will not provide the United States with a strong position.
The world of Jack Palkiewicz: Dubai, a true face
Dubai emirat is a place that continues to seek its identity, divided between Bedouin tradition, religious radicalism Islamic and extremism progressive.
This setting new trends will boost the imagination and desire of global tourism, gratifying the vanity of wealthy snobby hotels and attracting seeking forts of investors and traders the status of tax havens.
The web pages impress the enthusiasm for this city of dreams, which is an exciting temple of luxury and concentrated architecture of the 21st century in one.
It became Eden for those who love the rest, five-star hotels, beautiful weather and pools situated hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many are thrilled by the all-evident here, appreciates creative hyperactiveism and hisperic pursuits for the vanguardy.
Here is a city whose motto says all: “Small, stumbling and charming.”
And that's almost every step of the way.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling them a city without character.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the fullness of extremes and contradictions of the metropolis has taken the dimension of cheap grotesque.”
She turned into a futuristic nightmare entirely dominated by the "Guinness Record", an informal constitution of emirate.
Because everything here needs to be bigger and nicer than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is a lack of something that may be not clear in the old Europe, but important to the quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels like they're in their own home.
And in Dubai, I'm sure it isn't.
Running away from the wonder world, I broke up his golden mask, revealing the other face of an artificial paradise.
The count you don't talk about loud and don't write about.
I show the desolation of Asians contrasting with fairy tale conditions of the Divine ethnic caste of Dubai, Unmistakable Bedouin grandeurs.
I go into places of extreme poverty, for example to gett on the outskirts of the city, where under cruel conditions there is an army of Asian workers.
They built this one generation under slave conditions that reach the desert sky of Manhattan.
They came here with good earnings and the opportunity to ensure a decent life for their families, and they became a nightmare.
That tourist will never see because it could blow up in the air created over the years of Dubai's myth.
More and more frequent criticism of the international community makes the topic of cheap labour very difficult for the emir.
Mel C from the Spice Girls team banned her house talking about diets after her struggles with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm from the Spice Girls team admitted that there was a ban on diets in her house after she struggled with eating disorders for years eating only fruit and vegetables.
Spice sports did not eat for years and "obsessively practiced" as a result of the pressure associated with being a member of the world famous pop group, which later caused depression and eating disorders.
At present, she reveals that her experience affects how she raises her daughter Scarlet, which is why she “does not allow diets in her home.”
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I begin to see that she is more aware of her appearance," said Mel.
“I find that one of the positive experiences of eating disorders is that I am very aware of the way I speak to her.
The use of a positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview for Women's Health Mel magazine, who won fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that in the days before the creation of social media, the “distorting” press comments on the subject caused complexes.
"I began to look at myself in an inappropriate way, giving up certain groups of food products, practicing more and more obsessively, until I began to have the surprise," he says.
"I've been sick and it's probably been a few years."
A picture that shakes the world
Polish female and American documentaries gave the world a witness about the cruelty of war.
Legendary image of Juliena Bryan can be seen in Museum II of World War II in Gdańsk
“ Listen to my story.
I'm talking about the siege of the town of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America has to act, it has to help!", started its radio documentary, photographer, Julien Bryan.
On the tragic September day of 1939 he was in the capital of Poland, saw the drama of the bombarded city and its inhabitants.
His relationship has gone through a wide echo in the West.
President of Warsaw Stefan Starzyński first helped him, borrowed his car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a suicide note to his family in the U.S., deposited it in the embassy safe, and... stayed.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be wherever he was piling.
400 aircraft and artillery almost non-stop attacked the city.
Bryan has been witnessing death, suffering, the struggle to survive in the gilts of the city.
Just before the surrender, he and his members of the embassy took the negatives out of the ocean.
He didn't stop talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What happened to Warsaw will meet Paris, London, and even New York.”
His shocking chronicles have been seen by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the US began preparing for war.
“ Dad showed the truth and thus fought German propaganda.
They made films that glorifying their chivalry.
They said they didn't attack women and children and people believed them," said Sam Bryan, son of Julien.
The trial against the jury against the former athlete accused of multiple violence
There is a trial in front of the jury in the case of rape brought about by a former ex-bossing team at Delaware, who has been attacked by numerous sexual assaults.
On Friday after 10 days of statements and listening to arguments, members of the jury joined to settle the 23-year-old Clay Conaway fate.
A woman who was 21 years old claims that Conaway raped her when she went to his home in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the two contacts on the Bumble meeting page and sent to the woman by the man of the picture where he presented himself naked.
The woman is one of the six accusing Conaways for sexual assault between 2013 and 2018.
According to the defendants, the hugging that a woman had agreed to was in a rape that was opposed to her.
The defenses refer to conflicting relationships between women and gaps in memory and claim that a woman probably regretted that there was an intimate approximation.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for a million zlotys
You could see the 10th edition of the International Bike Fair BIKE-EXPO, covered with gold bikes worth a million zlotys.
It's an unusual vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His constructor, a 30-year-old Adam Zdanowicz, just received for him a bike Oscar at the World Cupwers Exhibition in Las Vegas.
An endless copy made a fury at the fair.
It's an unusual shell made by my colleague from the Zor.
“There is a saddle, there are pedals, there is a steering wheel, you could normally ride it.
It could travel 50 kilometers an hour.
It's an electric bike", it explains his constructor.
“Cyclerosis has been printed on 3D printer.
It's the cubes that form a kind of vortex.
I came up with the idea of this model riding my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on the card and hid it deep in the drawer.
The sketch has waited five years for implementation.
The bike itself was built for three years", added Adam Zdanowicz.
“It was cruelly difficult to hide all the elements under the body.
Inside are batteries, wires, elements forming a structure.
It is hidden under a body in 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
There's a motor hidden there, too.
The steering wheel for this bike was set up for a week before my departure to the United States at the World Bike Show.
I couldn't quite decide what that steering wheel was like.
She folds into transport.
A bike weighing 90 kilograms", summarizes.
The covered gold bike was appreciated in Las Vegas by the most important competition category "Best incredible single custom copy".
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist destinations
The Sydney bay, surrounded by an opera building, the Circular Quay port, Luna Park amusement park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge Bridge, brings its significant contribution to the amount of 21.9 billion dollars, annually pumped into the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
The famous Sydney bay is one of the most contaminated waterways in the country to which the volume of pollutants is affected every year equal to the capacity of about 15 Olympic pools.
These horrific statistics make one of our greatest tourist attractions one of our most dirty waterfronts.
According to the new film material entitled “ Sydney Bay – Up and Down”, waters in the area of Australia's most popular city are full of nocturnals, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, or even dead animals, and all of this goes down to the bay along with raintracks.
However, the largest part of our shipping channels is plastic.
“I would call this paradox” – says Dr Katherine Dafforn, Deputy Research Program Director Sydney Harbour Research Program, in published September 27, the publication of this film coincides deliberately with the World Tourism Day.
This Akwen looks beautiful, but it is one of the most changed and contaminated rivers along our coast.
CSIRO estimates that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic is transferred to our waterways, and most of it affects the bay through storm draining.
"After the rains are so powerful, the bay looks rather tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater.
However, as with the iceberg, the issue with the Sydney bay is much more serious under the surface of the water, since 70% of the plastic entering the ocean is coming to the bottom of the sea.
"In my opinion, unless you spend time under water, you can really not realize what is in the depths," Richard Nicholls said, owner of Dive Centre Manly, paying attention to the fact that he and his team pull out of the water about 500 kg of plastic every year.
I think if more people knew (which is under water), they would just be terrified.
It's overwhelming... more than half of what we find on the bottom is plastic grids.
The other 50% are things that are made of plastic at least.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and all the other garbage is taken right out of the surface.
Jeremy Brown, Co-founder and Managing Director of Ocean Protect, said that there are ways in which people – both local and tourists – could help reduce the amount of plastic and residues that are going to our waterways.
"This must begin at the source" – he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic used by us, improve the recovery of materials, and be more aware of what we drop in the sewers that eventually reach the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we are destroyed because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% carbon dioxide and our source of food.
But we can fix this bay and bring it back to its former glory, and it's very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we'll kill ourselves, too.
The film material financed by the TOMRA recycling company as part of its broader efforts to educate the Australians on environmental protection and reduce the negative impact of beverages containers, which often reach the environment, coincides with the examination of the relationship between plastic and mental health, the results of which have been published this month.
A new survey of 546 children from 12 to 18 years of age found that 82% of respondents felt helpless against plastic waste, and 25% of adults blame for the waste problem from disposable plastic packaging.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth largest parent concern, and 93% of the 551 parents surveyed said that their concerns about the amount of plastic wastes entering the oceans were increasing.
Many people who took part in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental anxiety.
Poland - Slovenia.
Memes after a game of netters in semifinals ME
It wasn't an easy match.
The Slovenians had on their part a natural audience, which successfully decentralized Polish netists.
Many controversy was raised by judges who did not count on the host’s side in one of the actions.
It happened at the key moment of the first set, when Vital Heynen's subservients had the chance to defy the rivals and win the first party.
However, it did not happen, and Poles eventually had to accept the height of the rival, who would play in the final tournament after winning 3:1.
Ghana: Traders from Kaneshie support psychiatric hospital in Akra

Google creates a cloud in Poland.
Partner of PKO BP
An operator of National Clouds, PKO BP and PFR, concluded a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is intended to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud computing technologies.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the Operator of National Cloud, and Google will open in Warsaw the so-called Google Cloud – the hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the Central and Eastern Europe region.
Google Cloud will be the first global, public computing cloud installation in Central Europe.
The digitisation of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions underlying the project's creation of the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Polski and by the Polish Development Fund, shareholders of this company.
The Partnership of National Clouds and Google is another important step in the way we set out less than a year ago, declaring the calling of an Operator of National Cloud.
The objective remains unchanged – digitisation of the Polish economy and self-imminating growth.
“Now Polish companies will gain additional, sophisticated tools to implement it.
By using them, they increase their chances of being promoted to the world league, which we all care about.
The fact that Google is joining their people today strongly strengthens our joint project", says Zbigniew Jagiełło, President of the Polish Bank.
The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.
"Investment in the National Cloud Operator is ideal for the PFR strategy as an important part of country digitisation.
It will provide business with modern and affordable solutions based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive effect on the development of the Polish IT market and will attract top specialists", adds Paweł Boris, President of PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing capacity and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all the key Google Cloud Platform products such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner or BigQuery.
The inclusion of Google Cloud's services into the offer of National Cloud will enable Polish entrepreneurs to benefit precisely from the same advanced technologies that global competitors use.
Thanks to us, however, we will remain in the Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators", says Michał Potoček, President of the Operator of National Cloud.
It adds that the company will be ready for megaprerds, such as Internet of Things (IoT), which repeatedly increase the demand for computing power needed to process huge data sets.
VI The General Council of the Seniors
At noon, August 24, 2019, at Ronda de Gaulle in Warsaw, the VI Parada of Seniors "Mature of Great" and Piknik Powolń, events organized by the Foundation of Starters began.
According to Przemysław Wiśniski of the Foundation: “Parada is a worldwide event.
The sixth time has passed through the centre of Warsaw to demonstrate how large and diverse communities are the seniors.
Through the parade, we counter the harmful stereotypes that affect older people and call for solidarity between generations."
The parade was led by a special floor coach for the music mobile scene, where the famous DJ Wika had traditionally appeared.
Participants in the joyful corrosion, during the second known Warsaw and world-wide defeats, have gone through the Jerusalemian Alejs, ul. Krustí to Warsaw Uprising Square, Mazowiecki to J. Piłsudski Square and the Royal and Krakow City Street at the Kampus Central University of Warsaw.
During the march, in which several thousands of seniors, representing 300 senior organisations from all over Poland took part, the colorful delegations were welcomed by classics gathered on the route of march, Warsaw and tourists.
Two organized groups were involved in corporate yellow and blue shirts.

Medical researchers have discovered how to mask certain tumour cells
The researchers found that the same process was involved in the Manhattan devils and humans.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new treatment methods for cancer patients
What do the Gestatan devils and people have in common?
Cancer cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolutionize the treatment of certain cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also include a key to treating fatal tumors in the face, threatening the future of the threatened Gemacean devil.
The study established how some cancer cells were masked in both humans and cysts, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which shuts down the marker, which would otherwise signal the immune system to attack the cancer.
This can be the greatest challenge for the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and the type of skin cancer called Mertle cell cancer.
"The great importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop resistance to immune therapy, we can be able to reverse this process," said AAP chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapies can be directed to reintegrate markers, proteins called MHC, which will allow the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
“Positively this has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer”, said Professor Dawson.
“This is one of the most common diseases on earth.
Or maybe we can treat her much better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will be used once to treat devil’s facial tumours, where cancer cells in a similar way avoid detection.
"It is unusual that the same process occurs (in the case of cancers in humans and in the Gestapo devils)" said Professor Dawson.
“As so far, it has been very difficult to treat the tumours of the Gatan devils.
But if medicines that work in humans can also be used inhabitant devils, it is possible that this will help control the disease".
Scientists are amazed at the fact that around a really small star there is a very large planet
Scientists express surprise after the discovery of the solar system of 30 light-years from Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the processes of planet formation, because in this system, a large planet similar to Jupiter is circling around a small star called red dwarf.
Artistic illustration of a gas-type planet of a giant GJ 3512b circumcised around a central star being a red dwarf, published September 26, 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets around them.
However, as scientists stated on Thursday, in this case the star and planet are slightly different.
The size of the star named GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the weight of the planet that is circling around it is at least half of Jupiter's mass, the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it is an absolute surprise" said the astrophysics Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Institute of Space Research, which was led by research published in Science magazine.
The discovery is surprising, because theoretical models of solar systems suggest that stars with low weight generally become mother stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptuns.
"In this case we have discovered a planet of type gas giants similar to Jupiter, circling around a very small star," Morales added.
This planet, which, like Jupiter, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It rounds its star after a very elliptical orbit and takes a full circle of 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent it has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, because it is only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are paleer than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately below 3800 (foot) Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they have red color," Morales said.
"There is evidence of a second planet currently around this star, while the third planet could have been thrown out of the star system in the past, which can explain the elliptical orbit of the planet similar to Jupiter," Morales said.
Planets are formed from the same interstellar drive of gas and dust, which gives birth to a star around which the planet is circling.
According to the leading model of planet formation, called acretion, the facility is originally built from solid particles in the disk, and the gravity force of the planet at the early stage of development allows for an atmosphere from the surrounding gas.
This unusual system can explain a competitive model called gravity instability.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than we expect and be cold," Morales said.
This leads to a disc stability disturbance and therefore some more dense areas may arise.
These masses can grow until the planet has fallen and formed.
Delicates’ worker accused of providing a methamphetamine-containing co-worker with a methamphetamine
The Bureau of Sheriff in Marion County held Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38 years old, for the administration of a methhamphetamine-containing beans dipper.
On Thursday, from Albany, 38-year-old Cassandra A.D. Medina-Hernandez was accused of providing methhamphetamine and caused by the consumption of that substance controlled by another person – both crimes are second-degree crimes.
The prosecution was launched on the basis of an event of 9 September at the Thriftway Food Shop in Jefferson.
Based on OregonLive.com's statement made under oath, indicating the probability of 27-year-old suspect co-worker told the Deputy Sheriff of Marion County that during the lunch break she saw Medina-Hernandez doing the beans dip that she had then been using.
On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of the crime, who, according to what she had given to the investigators, never had methamphetamine, said that "she thought that one of her eatings tasted strange, but did not raise any suspicions."
When she got back to work, she felt that she had stomach dissipation and that she couldn't stand on her feet.
As the Albany Democrat-Herald reports, she went to a local hospital where it was found that beans dip could contain methamphetamine.
On the basis of the reports of The Smoking Gun, according to the police, another member of the Thiftway network said that Medina-Hernandez "she told her that she would add drugs to food," while others admitted that the suspect sent her a message, claiming that methamphetamine was sent to the beans dip by accident.
The OregonLive website informs you about the recording from the delicacies surveillance, which allegedly shows how the back to the Medina-Hernandez camera pulls something out of the bra, becomes microwave and leans.
Then it's simple, it wipes its nose, comes up to the table and puts the beans dip in a small paper vessel.
According to the police, the thing she pulled out of her bra was probably also on the plate.
The Oregon Statesman-Journal states that the law enforcement staff are claiming that there is no suspicion at present in order to give customers contaminated food.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County in jail – the designated bail is $50,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that a woman has already been convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, meth-mphetamine delivery, theft, metaphetamine possession and possession of unauthorised weapons.
Johnson's giving a blow to a delay.
Boris Johnson's journey to the United Nations General Assembly was illegitimately interrupted by the historic judgment of the Supreme Court.
However, his devastating speech in the House of Gmin was neither ashamed nor ashamed of conscience.
To explain the meaning of this return, Tony Connelly, editor of the European RTE section in Brussels, and London's correspondent Sean Whelan in Westminster, is in the eye of the cyclone.

Marian Banas.
What's KAS doing about the NI'S boss?
Renting real estate for an amount below the market price is an objection which arises in connection with the case of President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasi.
We asked about what the vault is doing on this issue in the Chamber of Treasury Administration in Krakow and the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel, in his report for the "Supervisioner" TVN, raised doubts regarding the property statements made by the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control, Marian Banasia.
The Central Anticorruption Office has been under investigation for several months.
The audit is due to end in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was to rent a building with an area of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
A total of 65,7 thousand PLN each year.
The "Supervisioner" report revealed that there was a hotel in the building rented by it for hours.
He later explained on state television why he collected just over 5,000 zlotys a month for renting real estate.
"The Wyborcza Gazeta", referring to experts from the valuation of the property, estimated that this should be 15,000 zlotys per month for the building itself.
"The amount was lower because of a simple reason: I made a preliminary deal, and just because the tenant was to buy this stone, it made me agree to the lower rent that the remaining charges would be settled for sale of the stone", convincing Banas.
However, there has been doubts as to whether such proceedings are not a violation of the law.
Konrad Zawada, spokesperson of the Chamber of Treasury Administration in Krakow, told TVN24 that “the case is being dealt directly with by the Ministry of Finance”.
“All such questions are asked by the Minister of Finance,” he added.
He explained that in such cases "actions are carried out by the National Tax Administration".
The Press Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Paweł Jurek, admitted that the National Treasury itself monitors many cases that may raise objections.
“The National Treasury Administration acts in such a way that it has its own information, as well as is based in some way on the information available to the public.
On this basis, he decides whether to conduct possible proceedings or not", explained MF.
"However, because all of us are in force throughout the finance department of the treasure mystery, we never speak out because we cannot speak in individual matters of a particular taxpayer, a particular individual, or a particular company," he emphasised, the questions asked about Marian Banasius.
Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwieciński stressed that "the tax offices do not provide such information to the public."
"It is known that all the treasure apparatus deals with many similar cases throughout the country", he pointed out.
Secrets of the Royal Family: Surprised guests flying through a royal plane were revealed
As part of their duties, members of the royal family must travel hundreds of travels around the world during their lives.
It usually makes it easier for a king's aircraft – a private machine that drives a royal family around the world for major events and speeches.
It's not surprising that having your own plane involves privileges.
The members of the royal family do not have to stand in long queues for check-outs, there are no limits on the number of luggage and, as it turns out, they can invite any visitors on board - including truly unusual ones.
According to the recent Prime Minister of Channel 5 documentary film, not only queens and prince Philip often travel in royal aircraft.
During the programme entitled “The Secrets of King Flight” were the queen’s navigator who revealed that, together with the royal family, the furry guests often flew.
Bob Shields said: “Sometimes with our very important royal guests could fly very important royal dogs.”
It is not surprising that the queen could wish for her beloved favorites to accompany her travels, for she is known for her deep attachment to the dogs of the Corgi.
Since the youngest years, Queen Elizabeth has been a lover of these four-legged creatures and listen to the fact that since the coronation she has been the owner of more than 30 Corgi.
It is said that in 2007, she had five Corgi: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willowa and Holly.
There were five cockers welded: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spike and Spaniard, as well as four dogs that are cross-country storks from the Corgi: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The king's crew certainly had her hands full.
A royal house worker was seen walking dogs and asking them to take care of their needs before taking them aboard the plane – says Shields.
It's nice to tell you that there's never been any incident.
The program also reveals the shocking number of luggage the Queen takes on board during his journey in the course of his duties.
Narrator of the film stated: “In 1953, the queen took 12 tons of luggage on her journey of 70,000 kilometres.
To be able to picture it better, it's about as much as two huge elephants.
But the queen is not the only person with a modal weakness.
It is said that the princess Cambridge also has its own pleasure in the carriage of her wardrobe – it is said that separate seats are given for each of her dresses.
The new act enters into force.
The victims of accidents will receive pensions
On Friday, the regulation will enter into force to ensure that there is a serious injury to the payment of the pension – is further informed by the Financial Committee.
This is the 9 July 2019 Act on the special powers of victims in the event of exhaustion of the guaranteed sum established pursuant to the provisions applicable before 1 January 2006.
This applies to persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
In some cases insurers have already stopped payment of pension.
"I am pleased with this regulation because our institution has been seeking for many years to create a mechanism that will ensure the financial support of the communication OC or the farmer's OC, despite the exhaustion of the guarantee," says Alexander Daszewski, legal counsel at the Financial Ombudsman's office.
According to the Financial Ombudsman, this was necessary because it is often very tragic situations for people in very poor health, which cannot, for example, work and at the same time bear significant costs of accidental rehabilitation.
Some of them no longer received compensatory benefits and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the so-called guaranteed sum in OC policy.
Some of them have been threatening this in the coming years.
By 1 January 2006, the insurer's liability was much lower than the current ones.
Therefore, the problem of exhaustion of the guarantee sum in previous years has most often been affecting those who have suffered injury in the 1990s.
At that time, the guaranteed sum was very low, and economic conditions meant price increases.
“We have also seen that this problem has also affected a number of mostly young people who have suffered injury during the period when the sum was EUR 350 000 for each injured person in the accident.
Today, this is EUR 5.21 million for the event, regardless of the number of victims.
This is therefore a huge difference in relation to earlier times, hence the problem required legislative intervention", resembling Alexander Daszewski.
It explains that since the guarantee sum is up for a while, the legislator accepted that the upper liability of the Guarantee Fund would be the sum of the guarantee in force at the time when the pension claim was sent to the Fund.
This rule applies if the insurance undertaking is not required to pay the pension on the basis of a court decision setting a different amount of guarantee than that laid down in the OC insurance contract.
This is the case in case of an increase in the amount of guarantee on a judicial basis pursuant to Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which makes it possible to modify the existing commitment relationship.
"In recent days, we have sent letters to those who have requested intervention in the past.
We inform them about new powers and, of course, we provide for further support in the event of any problems", says Alexander Daszewski.

Former Congressman of Alabama Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, the retired Congressman of Alabama from the Republican Party, Jack Edwards, who served for 10 terms and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
The family officer said Edwards died in his house in Fairhope after fighting the cancer of the pancreas.
Edwards was originally elected to the American Congress in 1965 as one of the first Alabama Republicans in the Deep South due to the fact that the party gained its supporters here.
He served ten terms in Congress.
According to a statement issued by the family in response to the recent question of what the world would like to leave to its lawyers and lawyers, Edwards replied that he would like to return kindness.
"I hope that my lawyers and my lawyers will grow up in a country where the joint debate and efforts to solve the problems of the country will return kindness" said Edwards, according to his family statement.
The Governor of the state of Alabama Kay Ivey said Edwards served his own company and country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that during his part, the flag on Alabama State Chapter will be abandoned to half the mast.
“He was the personality of a true official of state and was the best husband of a state for Alabama.
Our state lost one of the most prominent politicians," Ivey said.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed great appreciation for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling Princess Sussex “a painful leader who breaks through the diagrams and makes our world better.”
The Duchess and Prince Harry, currently on the ten-day royal journey to South Africa with their son Arch Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a meeting with the youth at the beginning of this week, during which they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Majesty, Princess Sussex @sussexroyal, "a hard leader who breaks the regimens and makes our world better," wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic post.
“Doing this meeting with Obama Foundation leaders @ObamaFundation, or helping girls around the world gain access to education they deserve, is an inspiration for many people”, Obama added a picture of the smiling Meghan with the leaders of the foundation.
Meghan conducted an interview with Obama for the September edition of British Vogue, a hospitable actress of the “Suits” series.
In honest conversation, the first lady was talking about motherhood and how she was changed.
“Be a mother means leading to the championship of the art of forgiveness” - said Obama in an interview.
“ Motherhood has taught me that for most of my time it is my job to give children space so that they can know the world and become what they want to be.
Not who I want them to be or who I wanted to be at their age, but who they are in their heart.
Obama, who knows what the pressure of being on a candlestick is, shared with the princess with the council during an interview with the Good Housekeeping magazine.
“The challenge you feel – imposed by yourself and by others – can sometimes overwhelm you” – she said.
“My advice is, therefore, to slow down and not rush into anything.
In the first few months of the White House, I spent most of my time worrying about my daughter, making sure they were doing well at school and making new connections before I had given up more ambitious work.
I think it's necessary, too.
Hotel Trumpa keeps the permit to sell alcohol despite any complaint against the owner
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Commission on the Control of Alcoholic Drinks in Washington has given up a request to check whether Trump International Hotel should lose its licence to sell alcohol due to the owner's attitude.
The Agency ordered on Wednesday that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis was without grounds, because most of them did not live in or have real estate in the district.
"The Washington Post" states that for the second time they have tried to withdraw the hotel's alcohol sale permit by referring to the rule in force in the district that the applicant for a alcohol sale permit must appear "good".
The original complaint last summer stated that President Donald Trump was breaking the law, and the charges for assault and repeated cases of fraud were brought.
The complaint was dismissed because the authorisation was granted before it was made.
The second complaint resulted in an extension of the authorisation.
“The Sun”: The crushing report considers the police scandals in Cleveland as the worst in Britain
The inspectors considered the police to be the worst in the UK.
In the crushing report, they assessed the police work in Cleveland as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley, the chief inspector of her Royal Majesty's police, claims that there was a "significant deterioration" in Cleveland police service.
There have been new calls for police services to be resolved, with five commandors headed in six years.
According to the report, the police did not make efforts to prevent crime, arrest the suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley of Her Majesty’s chief police inspector said: “From our last inspection, standards have been significantly worsened.
Chief Mike Veale resigned in January after less than a year in the face of an investigation into the serious, yet undisputed, charge of his conduct.
Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts has been suspended after arrest on the charge of gross irregularities.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood stood in front of the Board of Declarations for assigning his coworker to sexual activities.
He's quit duty.
Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen said: “This is official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It is time for the Home Office to intervene now."
Police Commissioner Richard Lewis said: “After making improvements, I take full responsibility for carrying out police forces by changing.”
We've got a skatepark visual!
Do young people finally wait?
The older people are concerned by the young enthusiasts of riding on holynogs and skateboards, and they complain that there is no suitable place for them in Oláwa.
For years, young people have learned a place to ride rollers, skateboards, hulajnogs, bikes.
The theme is still returning to our error.
We've been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
Last time, it's gone loud again, there's no skatepark.
That's why we're back on this again, and we're gonna ask what's next in the office?
We remind you that a few days ago, a woman was called to stop young people driving downtown.
"I write on behalf of the people of the block at Pl. Piłsudski, to be interested in the situation of the Italian youth", writes Małgorzata.
“The city blocks called the City Guard repeatedly without success.
I send photos to prove such everyday situations in connection."
We asked the others about the case.
Most clearly state that young people simply have no place to go in the city and have been demanding a place for years to themselves.
Under the fasting on Facebook, there was a lawina commentary.
We already wrote in July that there was a chance that skatepark was built on the Olawska Miasteczka.
The mayor informed us that the city had asked for funding for the skatepark.
“A youth consultation project together with licences is ready.
On 28 March, the Ministry of Sport and Tourism issued an application for funding the task of «Building the Skatepark in Oław» under the Sportowa Poland programme”, we were told at the office.
Project total value: PLN 798 306,00.
requested amount of funding: PLN 263 440,00.
Now we've asked again what stage it is.
"We do not yet have information on the responsibility of the decision made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism on the application for funding", says Elżbieta Bednarczyk, Head of the Department of European Funds UM Olawa.
“The information obtained from the Ministry’s staff shows that the final choice of all tasks under the Sportowa Poland Programme should take place in October.”
We've also asked for visualisation of the Olympic skatepark.
We present it below.
The youth informed the editor that on Saturday (28 September) they would collect signatures under petitions concerning the construction of skatepark in Oław.
“The young people in the youth group saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they would organize a collection”, writes Santa Claus.
The signatures under the petition will be collected from 12.00 in the area of Lidl Market.
Polish Cup 2019/20: draw 1/16 final.
We know the couple, the hit from years ago
It was one of the most important rivalry in the extraclass.
The greatest legend grew a memorable match from the 1996/1997 season.
On June 18, 1997, Legia took an old stadium in Łezinkowski, a boat team in the railways.
Both teams divided the point.
The hosts had to win, the second in a row Polish championship gave a point.
In 87 minutes, Legia was leading 2:0, but for five more minutes there was an earthquake – the sight shot three goals and was glad for the title.
The Łódź club fell into more and more troubles over the years until it ceased to count in the fight for championship and fell from the top gameplay class.
For the last time, the two teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
Legia – on the way to title – two victories – 5:1 at home and 1:0 at the exit.
Return to Elyst
Now the boats are fighting to return to their national elites.
These plans were delayed by at least one year, since in previous competitions, one of the fans failed to get promoted to extraclass backs.
Consequently, the failure of the summer occurred at the club in the staff revolution.
The authorities changed, eventually put Marcin Kaczmark on the coach, and in doing the next step up the club hierarchy they are to help the leagues of Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możóże.
For the time being, the sight is the fourth in Table II of the League, but in the Polish Cup he defeated on Tuesday the Vice-President extralasy Śląsk Wrocław 2:0.
The legislation in the same sizes has sunk in the outing of Niepołomice.
Extra classic star
The only pair consisting of the highest class representatives in the 1/16 finals form the Benimins of LKS and Górnik Zabrze.
The swords of this phase will take place between 29 and 31 October.
This year it was scheduled to play 1/8 final (3-5 December).
The finale will take place on 2 May at the National PGE in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr "begined" and the impeachment investigation must be rolling through his path
You never know where we're going.
Now I think we're taking part in trying to hide facts from the facts, and the investigation might take some time," said Pelosi in an interview for CNN on the Capitol Hill.
"They do the work they started, keeping to the facts and the time needed to find them," she added.
This week, the White House reported that Trump had asked the President of Ukraine to investigate the former Vice President Joe Biden, the candidate from 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked the Zelenski to cooperate with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as shown by the protocol.
Trump denied doing anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Department of Justice had notified a complaint by the signaler concerning the Trump procedure involving Ukraine more than one week before the formal notification.
On receipt of a complaint as a complaint from officials from Intelligence Community, the Justice Department stated that Trump's call did not provide a criminal investigation on campaign financing.
Asked whether Barr should testify, Pelosi said that on Friday Intelligence Committee will decide who to call the witness.
She added, however, that she thought Barr had “defencated himself”.
It's been a long time.
"The Barra (Barra) is mentioned in all this", Pelos added, referring to Trump's statement on her Attorney General during a July dialogue with the leader of Ukraine.
I wonder if he made decisions on how to handle the complaint.
Pelos told me that he was afraid of the signal drivers Trump attacked as spies on Thursday, suggesting that in the past he had done differently with spies.
I believe the President's words go beyond their responsibility, it's dangerous.
Our signalers play an important role in discovering – depriving the statements in our government", said Pelosi, adding "The President's word concerning persons who can provide information seriously undermine the integrity of the government."
On Tuesday Pelosi took a historic step in the announcement of a formal investigation into the execution of an unlawful act based on the pleas of trying to press the leader of a foreign State to obtain political benefits.
The call address was included in a complaint published on Thursday, which claimed that Trump had abused his power to "increasing Ukraine to interfere" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The signalist also alleged that White House lawyers had told officials to delete a record of conversations from the computer system in which it was kept for officials of the Council of Ministers, and to put it in a system that was particularly sensitive to information.

A possible ban on driving cars for excessive speed for the Crystal Palace of Christian Bentke's assailant
The Premier League Star Christian Bentke, which has been caught twice in the last two months, threatens to drive.
The Crystal Palace attacker, 28 years old, admitted to driving a Bentley car at an hour of 80 miles an hour on the ground, limiting up to 50 miles an hour on the A3 road in Richmond, southwestern London on 20 January.
Then, in March of the Putney photoraders in southwestern London, Belga recorded 89 miles per hour, which is twice the limit of 40 miles per hour.
Bentke of Kingston Hill of Surrey doesn't have to be in Peace Court this morning at Lavender Hill.
He confessed to both claims at the beginning of July under a simplified procedure on the basis of which crimes lighter are judged at a meeting held by one judge of peace.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned about the structure of the Review Commission
Kofi Manu, football manager and representative of Sekondi Hasacas, raised doubts regarding the composition of the verification committee for the upcoming elections to the National Football Association in Ghana (GFA).
He questioned the involvement of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, adding that he was not pleased with his participation.
In an interview with GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would be fair because the outcome of the verification process was in his interest.
The verification committee should consist of neutral outsiders who do not have links with any of the members and who have not shown any interest before.
Davies, for example, employed NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer in relation to the payment of 10 percent.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take up office in the Review Committee because he has an interest in it", he claimed.
Manu declared that if Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games before the Commission, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President because of his association with the club, suggesting that, if the State of Palmer, he would be objected to prejudice and partiality before the Commission.
As expected, the members of the Commission were expected to start work yesterday, following the oath at the GFA Secretariat in Akera on Tuesday, 19 September, and to end it on October 4.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies, and its members are consultant on corporate governance and lawyer Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Laryea, Marketing and Business Director and Richard Akpokavie, Sport Administrator and lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on the unity government
The two main parties of Israel, the Alliance of Blue and White, continued on Friday's negotiations on the establishment of a unity government.
The meeting, which took place after the President's mission to form the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, did not bring any results.
The talks considered the possibility of rotating the two parties in government and remaining Netanyahu as Prime Minister, but, as the Israeli daily “Haarec” writes, no closer views have occurred.
The talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Alliance of Heaven-Bials informed in its Communication that he had presented preliminary proposals.
Likud’s right-wing accusation that he “kneaded at his positions” demanding that his leader and prime minister, Netanyahu remain at the head of the government, and that he was part of his ultraorthodox politics.
"Since the very beginning, it has been known that the Blue-Biali will not agree on these conditions", the voices published by them have been reported.
Likud, acting solely in the interests of Netanyahu, wants to "take the second round of elections" in Israel.
The leader of Blue-Bialy Benny Gantz refuses to support the government led by Netanyahu as long as he is charged with taking part in three corruption offers under which the D.A. could formally accuse him after the Wednesday meeting.
“Licud and Blue-Biali have obtained a sufficient majority in their elections on 17 September, which would allow them to share governments as natural allies, but this forces them to negotiate which none of the parties wanted,” writes the EFE agency.
President Reuwen Rivlin has been trying to bring their positions closer in recent days and has proposed that he temporarily suspend his functions in order to allow Gantz to take this position if the accusations against Netanyahu were sustained and formalised.
Not a lack of Israeli analysts who think things have fallen into a dead end.
However, half of Israelis, according to a poll published on Friday's public television, want to unlock the political situation in the country by setting up a unity government under the rotating leadership of the transformation of Netanyahu and Gantz.
50.6% of Israelis, 32.1% of respondents object to such a solution.
The probe shows a deep division in Israeli society – the question of who should be the first to face the office, 41.8% of respondents advocate Netaniah and 40% for Gantz.
In another survey published by the newspaper "Israel Hajom" the percentage of members of the government of unity increases to 63%, 60% is opposed to the new elections which would be third this year.
In the early parliamentary elections on 17 September, the Gantz Alliance won 33 mandates in the 120th floor of Kneseta, Likud Netanyahu won 32 mandates.
Netanyahu with its traditional and potential allies can count on supporting 55 Members, while Gantz – 54.
None of the parties gathered 61 mandates necessary to obtain the majority.
Cipuric calls for a fight against the last game of Australians
Justin Tipuric says that "this is the time to check out," when Wales is facing the final game against Australia in the World Cup, which can shape their fate in the tournament.
The victory of Wales over the "kangures" would set this team up in a position of some favorite to win Group D and ensure that they participate in a likely quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia beats Wales for the past 14 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be instantly returned to the Star with England as part of the first eighth final.
"Let's make it clear, both teams want to try and go through this and find themselves at the head of the group," said Valianz Tipuric.
There have been some difficult results in the past, but last fall was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they're going to be impatiently trying to take this victory away from us, and we want to bring it back again.
Before we came here, you knew this was gonna be a big old man.
And now we're here, and it's really time to check.
Wales only won one victory over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in World Cup history – and this happened 32 years ago in a game about the third place when they defeated "kangura".
And their complete record under the command of Chief Coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to overcome three teams of heavyweight from the southern hemisphere.
Wales tracked down 13 losing test matches from Australia's hands last November, and Tipuric prepared himself to be among the few survivors of this 9-6 win, who will be going to Tokyo stadium on Sunday.
Cipuric asked whether before this victory the team experienced a mental blockade, added: “It is difficult to say.
These games are so leveled that maybe... people expect you to have a certain mental blockade, I don't know.
At the end of the last game we probably left on the field about 15 points, so the final result looks a lot smaller than it actually was.
If Wales triumphs, then the Tipurica fight with the beloved Australian duo from the third line of Michael Hooper and David Pocock’s mill will be essential during detention and defeat.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in the colours of representation and met both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what he was waiting for.
"They are players in position of the seventh absolutely world class," he said.
When you play against the world-class players of the third line, you always know that a difficult game will be played.
These two are constantly facing the best players in the world.
You know what games to expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably better to feel Rugby because he is always in the right place at the right time.
It is better to play against the best players in the world and face challenges than to face the third line of mill, which is not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and if you struggle with the two, I'm sure you have to be in top form.
I wouldn't say Sunday it's almost the finale of the Cup, but it's an important match for us in this World Cup.
The implant is an important part of it.
When we build strength and constantly put together a lot of effort, we're going to fly on our wings and we're going to be hard to beat.

Book Prime Minister.
"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Młynarczyk
They were supposed to be an elite organisation of the "manage of the masters."
They accepted in their ranks those they despised.
Could crime combine stronger than national identity?
In your hands we give not another book about war or military matters.
We give you a deep international study on the participation of non-Germanys in Waffen-SS.
The historians from different European countries study the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, remind themselves of their activities and look at recruitment processes at different stages of the war.
Did the Danish troops differ from the French?
Where did he come from, the Ukrainian enthusiasm?
Why couldn't we create a Polish squad?
What is the official narrative of cooperation between European countries today?
What happened to volunteers after the war?
These questions include the Waffen-SS book based on solid research material.
We sought to present a subtler and more balanced, closer truth to the picture of collaboration in Europe during the Second World War, also trying to break the methodological limits of history and the period of history through presentation of hearings by researchers from different countries. (...) As far as the fates of the main victims of this war - forced workers, Jews, prisoners, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slavs' population - are sometimes presented in a comparative and/or transnational manner, so many perpetrators are examined essentially from national perspectives (as far as they do).
"total panic", when the White House is struggling to find arguments about impeachment
White House officials are getting wet when they figure out how to deny the pressures restored on the Thursday, and one of the conversations that are familiar with the situation describes the sense of "total panic" felt last week due to the lack of an answer plan for the new reality.
It seems that this is "a concern, uncertainty and fear" – one of the White House’s people describes the mood in the Western wing – that the charges of the informant can seriously harm the President and its people.
The person stated: “There is no certainty that nothing is hiding there.”
White House officials were still uncertain about how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious action plan in this situation, but also because the charges are so serious that the standard methods for effectively avoiding the controversy used by the president in the past can not work. “It does not seem to be something that passes along with the appearance of the next cycle of the headlines” – the person has made a joke.
Another person who knows the course of the discussion described the situation in the White House as a “state of shock”, accompanied by an increasing distrust that, together with the ongoing impeachment investigation, the possibility of the President responding in an irresponsible manner and becoming “hard to control”.
This fear is divided by another interlocutor claiming that the President's environment will provide for it to display more "porative" behaviour, and the pressure on it will certainly begin to increase every day in the impeachment investigation.
This concerns the concern that Trump can present ever more unpredictable behaviour and will in an unexpected manner explode – this is in the context of the year of electoral fear both from the point of view of the presidency and the election.
Having faced the greatest threat in the presidency so far, Trump was running from attack to defense, re-iterating the strategy he judged to be effective during Robert Mueller's investigation on Russia.
He tried to seize his own request to the Ukrainian President to assist in the investigation of his political rivalry in order to draw attention to and direct it to the actions of the Democrats and the candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, and to discredit the informant as leading party motives.
But while many people in the White House are in the fight after Mueller's investigation, something has changed this time – the advisers and consultants said.
The president, whose exploratory sign is strength, showed the Wednesday press conference as a defeater, declared one of the people familiar with the situation.
While Trump was enthusiastic about the Russian investigation, he seemed reluctant to answer Ukraine’s questions – they said.
Some of the allies believe that damage can be avoided, and some of them hold onto the fact that the informant had no knowledge of the first question of this controversial phone talk between President Trump and Ukrainian president Wolodymyr Zielenski – which they believe undermines his credibility.
And as it often happens, when the President is the object of attacks, this fact is alive raised by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the republican strategies related to the White House indicates that the results of the President's polls are ungodly high, and impeachment will not be too much to gain new sympathies.
"There is no positive need to focus on the President's impeachment in the next four months", especially if this hinders its legislative agenda and prevails in the new series of headlines.
Another speaker claims that those who maintained that the impeachment would help the president, did not quite understand how unforeseeable his reaction would be.
White House officials were looking for help with counsellors by completing an impeachment response team.
According to a person with knowledge of plans, given that these efforts are in the early stages, it is unclear whether any initiative in the style of the command center will be taken and what form it may take.
This person stated that there is a belief that a coordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a strong leadership in the field of PR, which is a ripost for the publication of an obvious signal report, with a view to halting the debate of the democrats' actions on impeachment given by the disclosure of this report.
The speaker, familiar with the situation, maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announced that they had no intention of revealing a note describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it was possible to feel that there was no way out and the document had to be published.
One of the people who can be involved in the development of an answer to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, a man from Trump's dirty work, and the former leader of the electoral staff, said the person involved in the case.
However, Lewandowski said in a conversation with NBC News that it is not true to suggest that he will direct this action.
"For the past five years I have done everything I could to support the president and his programme," he said, but I have not been involved in any discussions with the president or his team about joining the team in order to back off the false narrative of impeachment."
Donald Trump's private lawyer from Mueller investigation, Jay Sekulow, is also involved in impeachment activities.
"We respond to matters as appropriate" – Sekulow replied when he was asked by NBC News to comment.
Today, the White House feels a lack of lawyer experienced in the field of impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked at Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, left, and the current advisor Pat Cipolone, does not have this kind of experience.
The speaker informed the White House's strategy that officials had no intention of involving people or creating a command center at any time, but admitted that the need for a coordinated, joint response and a political struggle could lead.
Examinator Explorer of the Seas Line Royal Caribbean has been refurbished for £89 million
Explorer of the Seas, belonging to the Royal Caribbean International family, will leave this summer on a cruise, presenting a completely new look.
After renewal, which has absorbed an impressive $110 million (€89 million), the ship delights with a wide selection of culinary flavors from all over the world and a rich offer of entertainment for the whole family.
This summer Explorer will stop at the most beautiful ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to feel the taste of Mediterranean Europe.
When the adventure on land is over, the crew of the ship promises an unforgettable impression at sea.
With the satisfaction of each Explorer, after renovation of $110 million, around £89 million, he was transferred to a passenger ship providing excellent entertainment for the whole family.
An impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board with advanced surf simulators or watch their favorite family movie, using the weather charms, within the outdoor cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addition of virtual balconies, which allow passengers inside cabins to admire ocean views without having to go on board.
The water lovers will impress the new deck by the pool connecting the Caribbean resort style with the water park charms.
The pools surround the beach hammocks and lounges perfect for the sun, and the two modernized slides are within the reach of the people who are thirsty by powerful impressions on board.

Devin Nunes accuses Democrats that they demand “the naked photos of Trumpa”
Congressman Devin Nunes from the state of California apparently cannot bear the naked truth of the investigation of President Donald Trump.
In his fourth defense of the President, he accused the Democrats that they wanted to receive naked photos of the president.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican member of the Board of Representatives Committee, has put forward the above allegations in the course of a preliminary statement in the course of a complaint by a signalist, as if Trump asked Ukraine to assist in initiating an investigation against the candidate of Democrats to President Joe Biden and his son.
The Congressman called the Ukrainian scandal a "grotesque show" of the left and their "medial ace" before he said that the Democrats wanted to see photos of the president in the negligent.
"The Democrats in this committee have negotiated with the people who were Ukrainians in their opinion to receive the naked pictures of Trumpa," said Nunes.
“People can rightly ask why Democrats are so determined to place the President in the state of charge once they have their chance in a year.
When Nunes finished reprimendes, a political reporter on HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats were really trying to discover it.
So far, only representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, has replied, although we suspect that his answer is the naked truth, which confirms many of his colleagues' thoughts.
Mediaite.com reports that Nunes' comments on nagnosity refer to "some more looser and unconfirmed information", which is likely to appear in the controversial Steele's files,
It is famous, gathered by former British spy Christopher Steele, a collection of charges against Trump, indicating the probability of the existence of a tape that shows him watching the power of prostitutes in the hotel room in Moscow.
Potential research into renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi Tesli have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to be leaking renewable energy – aircraft.
However, the professor at Albert University developed a technology to enable renewable biofuels to be used as an aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at Albert University at the Faculty of Agriculture, Life and Environment, who started working on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory produces hydrocarbons obtained from fatty waste such as restaurant fat, animal origin fats and rapeseed oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower-quality oils during production, estimated to reach 85% lower carbon emissions than for petroleum fuels, and used in the waste process from other industries.
This technology is designed to immit the hydrocarbons present in diesel fuels.
"What our technology did in the first generation," Bressler said, "that's the [total creation] of hydrocarbons, which are the same particles as diesel fuel."
While this opens up a new possibility for biofuels to be used, previously developed biofuels tended to destabilize at lower temperatures, which in case of large-scale aircraft represented a serious risk.
"The air fuel problem is a little wrong circle" said Bressler.
It's really less worth than diesel, but it's got higher demands.
Bressler laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aviation biofuels.
The first option is a small-risk approach that requires additional hydrocarbon treatment and hydrogen addition.
The second option is to continue working on partly developed chemical properties that will provide stability fuel, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with the chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," said Bressler, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
The spray company created by the Alberta University, Forge Hydrocarbons, works on the commercialisation of the product, as airlines, as well as the Canadian and American Army, increase investment in the renewable option.
"They are able to imagine the times in which the reverse of the situation can occur and will be imposed a carbon tax on them," he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will be an emergency plan.
Forge is currently running a pilot facility near the Edmonton Waste Management Center and has recently received a total of $4 million from Lockheed Martin as part of an investment to support a cost-effective $25 million production facility, which will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce approximately 19 million litres of biofuels per year.
Bressler also notes that the carbon reduction envisaged will amount to about 85 percent, but issues such as the transport and production of fuel will halt the further reduction of coal.
"As a tech specialist," said Bressler –
I have the task of developing options that enable conscious decisions and many options to choose."
CHANGE: Another granddaughter fraud
8 thousand PLN and 750 euros lost the estate of Zamość thinking he was helping his grandson, who caused the accident.
The police informed about the event on Thursday the son of a duped castle.
“A woman called on Wednesday, a man giving up for her grandson.
He said he caused the accident and needed money.
Otherwise, he's going to jail.
In order to help her grandson, she provided PLN 8 thousand and €750 to a fake police officer who came to her house", reports Dorota Krukowska-Bubila from the Zamějska police force.
Police are looking for the perp and once again ask for caution:
‘Every phone call with a request for financial assistance should be verified.
Do not act under the influence of emotions and in haste.
Let's remember that the cops don't ask for money and don't accept the money.
If we receive a call with a request for financial support that raises our suspicions, respond immediately and notify the Police by calling the emergency number 112.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about the dangers, let's get to know how the cheaters work.
Let's ask for caution and not trust those who call and ask for a loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's allies warn that when the UK's brixity is withdrawn, they're threatening ZAMIA, such as in Los Angeles, and he calls for peace.
One of the chief cabinet ministers said yesterday evening that the country was threatened by a “violent social event” if the original result were challenged by the result of the second referendum.
The allies of the Prime Minister of Great Britain from his immediate surroundings warned that the country was threatened with social concerns on the scale of the "yellow vests" protests in France due to social inequalities and riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for “speakment of moods” during a grievous debate on the language of politics, but stressed that he would not stop using the word “sent”.
Despite his call for peace, the cabinet minister said, “The Times”: “In this country there have never been any protests like demonstrations of “gilets jaunes” ("yellow vests") or riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because they didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – giants jaunes – they use encrypted phones that can coordinate the picnics, and only a few unscrupulist populist leaders are enough to push people into the protest.
The Los Angeles riots exploded after the jury kidnapped four white policemen who beat up Rodney King's black cab driver in 1992.
This year, anti-government protestors in France carrying yellow retro-reflective vests – the guile of jaunes – for more than six weeks are deserted and deserted by the streets of Paris.
The Minister referred to the Johnson alert issued in the House of Commons and said that if Britain fails to get out of the EU, there will be a "catatrophic loss of trust in our political system".
"If we organize a referendum in which 30 million people are voted, and 66% of them will report to remain the United Kingdom in the European Union, unsatisfyed will remain ten million citizens," said the Minister.
Even if this result ignores 99% of them, we will still have 100,000 angry people who will write to their envoy and who will not forgive.
There's a lot you don't have to see soon on the street of a couple dozen thousand people.
One of the chief cabinet ministers added that the country could be threatened with a “violent social event” if the result of the first referendum was challenged by the result of the second.
Johnson called for a universal election to be organised in which voters would decide the fate of the brixity.
According to the report, the Prime Minister is facing a risk of rebellion in order to reduce requests for brixit and achieve a compromise with the EU.

It was all in the context of the Talk'N'Roll conference, which took place in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Expanding horizons, talking about ideals worth of publicity and joint discussions that can become an impetus to further development.
Such a goal was set before them by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 unique speakers, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, including those known from the media - Simon Holovnia, Krystyna Cubówna and Irene Krosne.
This year's edition of Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the Future, NEW" and it was about creating the future that the guest invited to attend the conference focused.
The first session was opened by the Managing Director of Sabre Poland, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who spoke about how the brand, which is built around itself, could have an impact on our future.
Richard Lucas went out on stage to change public perception of the phenomenon of rejection, claiming that it should be accepted if he wanted to create the future, in turn Chris Badura took the subject of empathy in the time of rapid technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) has shared insights and techniques that can help manage careers and increase overall satisfaction by finding an appropriate balance between professional life and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multi-occupied conversation with Krystyna Cubówna, which related to how it changed the profession of a tutor in Poland from its perspective over the years.
The owner of one of the most popular voices in the country has admitted that, thanks to technological development, everyone can today have a hard time with this profession.
However, in the years to come, he does not think that the teacher’s position is completely replaced by technology.
Peter Nabielec, after her, had taken the problem of life during the time of the information, emotional overload, or the overload in the question of choice, providing the audience with valuable guidance on how to deal with it, and Łukasz Łętcha spoke in his speech about what might lead to another industrial revolution known as "Industry 4.0".
Playing to teach you how to play
The organizers of the conference also provided an artistic impression, inviting Daniel Jedinak to the stage of the illusionist.
In turn, the third part of the conference opened Ms. Ireneusz Krosny, who first played with the pantonima audience, and then, on an example of his career, he talked about how he was trying to maintain the right balance between his career on stage and private life.
Simon Holovnia also kidnapped participants in his speech, stressing above all the role of time in our lives.
The publicist indicated that even two minutes might dimetrically alter the situation and be ready to use this time.
In addition, the Holocaust shared his thoughts about the reality surrounding us, recalling the anecdotes that might have caused a smile on the faces of the viewers.
Then there was Adrian Tworcza, who reviewed the history and objectives of several models of innovation and referred them to how they are currently being used.
At the end of Marcin Slovek, like Rubik's cube, talked about his approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly brought something new to the perception of the reality of all who had the opportunity to watch the performances, and the natural reactions and many questions to guests are proving a great commitment from the audience.
The organizers provided transmission for all who could not personally participate in the event and the recordings from the presentation are available on the website.
Rulers of law instead of rule of law.
"In spite of the lack of sufficient votes to change the Constitution, the governing majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the rule of law and the principle of the tri-department of power", writes in the Helsinki Foundation's report on Thursday.
The 'Legal Governments' report documents, inter alia, changes in justice and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published on Thursday a report entitled “Leadership rather than rule of law.
Risks to protect human rights in Poland in 2015-2019".
The Foundation assesses in the report that in 2015-2019 the largest regression in the area of human rights protection was recorded in Poland after 1989.
"In spite of the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the governing majority introduced a number of changes in the state system, putting the rule of law at risk and the rules of the Tripartment of Power.
In adapting the right to political objectives, the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of law", says HFPC experts.
What's in the HPPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of justice, independent bodies (such as the Public Media and the Ombudsman) and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT rights and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarises the dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union for three years.
"In the last four years, we have observed the use of the right to carry out party interests for the first time and on such a scale.
This was translated into the ongoing rule of law crisis, as well as the weakening of the entire human rights protection system in Poland", stressed the lawyer Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years are "systemic changes both in the country and in the protection of human rights".
Over the last four years, the Sejm has adopted more than 20 legal acts key to human rights protection.
"The changes were often taken at a speedy pace, without public consultation and despite legal concerns about the environment, the Ombudsman or international organisations", explained Małgorzat Szulek, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed in the last four years are: "the weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), the non-respecting of binding judgments of courts and recommendations of international institutions and the weakening of the protection of human rights".
State authorities have not responded
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs was particularly concerned about "these situations in which the authorities did not react or simply disregard the emerging cases of aggression".
Foundation experts noted that some changes were introduced in the atmosphere of attacks against individual institutions or groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the results of state activities in the area of the reduction of the rule of law are the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from international law entities.
"The failure to implement these recommendations does not only weaken Poland as the leader of democratic change in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, but also expose the Polish state to responsibility for violations of European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights", we read in the report.
The brother of the Pakistani Social Media Star with life for honor killing
Women's rights experts claim that the investigation of justice is often difficult due to prolonged proceedings, the release of suspected killers under bail and the cloud of public awareness.
“It is so long that people forget” – says Farzana Bari, guardian of women's rights and founder of the first gender studies department in Pakistan, and adds that even a wide-ranging case of Baloch's murder has been settled over three years.
Although, according to women's rights groups, reliable data are difficult to establish, the Pakistani Human Rights Commission in 2018 identified at least 300 cases of so-called honor killings.
Many activists claim that the actual number is much higher, and the network promoting awareness of crimes from honorary motives estimates that there are about one fifth of the thousands of honor killings committed every year worldwide.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, the messages to the country are decreasing because many migrants are outside Poland – says the Friday “Rzeczpospolita”.
The latest Euro-Tax report shows that the average earnings of Poles working in other European countries amounted to more than 8,6 thousand PLN in 2018, which means that nearly a thousand PLN have increased, i.e. almost 12 percent.
The Euro-Tax estimated that the total income of Polish earnings migrants in the EU countries reached PLN 154,5 billion in 2018, with one seventh more than a year earlier, we read.
Director of Research Centre on Migration of the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk says that Poles are increasingly on the international labour market, where they use different options.
"There are also growing numbers of specialists and professionals who move from country to country in search of more and better conditions, as well as employees of international corporations", reports the newspaper.
Some Euro-Tax clients work in two countries, e.g. UK and Germany.
“It is in the RFN in 2018 most because 11%, total earnings of Polish migrants increased (up to PLN 27 billion).
However, most of them have earned Poles in the Islands – almost PLN 35 billion", we read further.
The President of Euro-Tax believes that despite improving working conditions in the Polish market, the number of earnings migrants does not decrease.
For still the saxis in the West and the north of Europe (in front of Norway) is often a chance for several times higher wages than in Poland.
“Even at minimum rates in a given country, which, for example, in Germany amounts to EUR 9.5-11.7 per hour”, informs the logbook.
"Rzeczpospolita" states that Poles are not only left because of higher earnings, but also because they have settled abroad.
Many Poles leave their roots abroad, as can be seen after the shrinking transfers of money to the country.
The last year was the lowest in years.
As the economist Tadeusz Chrostecki recalls, a group of people transferring money to the country is declining, along with the extension of the time spent abroad.
"Emmigrants bring their loved ones together," read on Friday 'Rzeczpospolita'.
Extending monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extended by almost a month, and the unusual rainfall causes death as a result of the removal of buildings and the cost of many crops.
Usually, in northern India monsun is going to drop in early September, but average rainfall this month exceeded 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the end of the monsoon for decades at the latest.
In many areas of the country rains are still unusual – during the recent time in the west of India, the cities of Pune Wednesday and Thursday rains led to the death of a dozen people and desolation as a result of the collapse of buildings.
There was a flood of houses, people took down streets in the water to the knees, which normally only takes place during monsoon apogeum.
Large rainfall also occurred in cities such as Kalkuta, Lucnow and Hajdarabad.
As a result of the long rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many houses were destroyed.
Monsun also started late.
Many areas lacked water, so farmers prepared for the likely drought.
Too long a monsoon is not welcome by farmers.
This amount of rain isn't normal at this time of year.
“By him, my vegetables – and now I have cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes – will rot”, says Prakash Mehra, farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the late and late end effects of monsoon mean an increase in the price of onions, an indispensable ingredient in Indian food.
Onion, usually worth 20 rupees (0.23 pounds of British) is currently worth 80 rupees (about 1 pound of British) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Bombay.
Festivals and holidays are also at stake.
Another big festival is the 8th of October, Dasara's holiday, during which Indians raise huge doves like the comic book Ravana, a character of a lush mustache and a wild smile from the ‘Ramajana’ epos.
Ravany's burning symbolizes a triumph of good over evil.
However, given that Ravavy's likeness was made out of paper, if monsun continues to exist, Ravana will be laughing last.

Doodle celebrates the 21st birthday of Google
It would be difficult to imagine a world without Google today.
The search engine is looking for answers to all the asking questions.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is this?", "Where?", "How?" and "How?" are some of the popular categories searched by Poles.
According to the gypsy data, we were eager to ask, among other things, "Where is the storm?", "How to make scarlet?" and "How many fingers does the horse?", "How to get rid of the flour of fruit?", "How to eat cocoa?".
Today, the search engine is celebrating her 20th birthday.
Its users – and in Poland as many as 96% of people use Google's uncle – are welcome today to Google Doodle.
He's not animated this time.
Google recalls its birthdays, showing a stationary computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the right lower corner a digital date was printed – as in a picture of the 1990s.
Synchronising folder
The search engine was designed for a specific purpose – it was intended to catalog all possible information and share it via the internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term googol, which represents the number ten up to the hundredth power.
This name was also intended to reflect the intention of the company to express as many pages as possible from the global Internet resources.
Google Search was founded by Sergey Brina and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their studio project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which worked better than the usual analysis of the results based on the frequency of the frequency of the frequency of the phrase.
In the beginning, the search engine was called BlackRub, referring to the English words blacklink, which means the number of pages that refer to the result.
Page and Brin set up a company under Google Inc. September 7, 1998, and soon opened a famous web page google.com.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, “PC Magazine” appears information about the extremely high relevance of Google’s search results.
Then the company's history looks almost like a fairy tale - rapid development with every month, conquer further markets and increase the value of the company.
In June 2000, the Google URL index has more than a billion items, which makes Page and Brina's work gain the name of the world's largest web search engine.
Currently, Page and Brina are one of the leading players on the IT market.
Is there another development field?
" Google's mission is to organise global information resources to be widely available and useful, although we have made huge progress in this area, it is still a very long way to achieve this goal," said Piotr Zalewski of Google.
Common exposure to pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
The new study suggests that working with exposure to plant protection products in great strength can translate into a high risk of heart problems in later years of life.
This happened in the case of a Japanese American group in Hawaii, which has been tested for more than 30 years.
Scientists found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45% more likely to have a heart disease or stroke.
"This study highlights the need for personal protection equipment to be used on time with pesticides at work and the importance of recording in medical records contact with such measures at work, as well as checking standard factors that increase the incidence of heart disease," said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez, co-author of research.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
The result was based on data on more than 6000 men on the island of Oahu who participated in the cardiology programme of Kuakini Honolulu.
As scientists pointed out, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations, as it concerned only men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life of decay, so the effects of their health impact can be known many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years of contact with plant protection substances.
The press release Rodriguez stated: “After 34 years of observation, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart diseases and stroke was no longer significant.”
This was probably because the most important factors for aging, which masked possible causal relationship between exposure to pesticides and the incidence of cardiovascular disease in the later years of life.
Researchers have not identified a significant relationship between exposure to low to moderate amounts of plant protection products and increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Phone calls Zelenski-Trump: Poroshenko adds three cents
Washington's politics is having a terrible week of impeachment against American President Donald Trump
The political scandal is for the political debut of Wolodymyr Złenski's situation, which he would prefer to avoid.
But what exactly do we know about the Zełenski-Trump affair, and will it have far-reaching consequences for the first one?
Almost at the opening of the phone call, Trump declared Zelensk that the United States is doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the White House's notes are not full, they describe in detail the Trump attack on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the fact that German leaders and other European leaders are engaged in negotiations instead of making concrete proposals.
The controversy raised the Zelenski response, which stated that it agreed with Trump not 100%, but in 1000%.
Złenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel were not enough to help Ukraine.
This speech made politicians, particularly the Ukrainian opposition, decided to speak through social networks.
Mr Porosenko, the former president of Ukraine, stated on Twitter that the EU's support "was "free of precedent".
In other EU tweets, Poroshenko said he was grateful for the EU's "Russia aggression" support, which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, including Victoria Voytsisska's Ukrainian politician, said: “How can we speak now with Germany and France?”.
Then Trump mentioned military aid and asked the Zelenski to investigate not in one case, and two cases: the first concerning Joe Biden's son, Hunter, and the second related to the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacker attack on the Democrats' e-mail boxes during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether it will spoil European relations or break up with the leaders of France and Germany.
I don't want to talk bad about anybody...
Thank you all for our assistance" – he said after the publication of the Zelenski phone call in New York during the UN General Assembly.
Złenski is to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming summit of the "Fundamental Four" to be held in October.
Former Deputy Commander of the General Court of Justice of the General Court of Justice of the European Union.
The court cleared George Wiśniwski with his actions rejected.
After six years, Jerzy Wiśniewski was finally cleared of charges.
The District Court cleared George Wiśniwowski, former Chief of the Wojewski Commercial Quality Inspector of Agricultural and Food Articles in Rzeszow, on the charge of overcapacity.
Lubelska Public Prosecutor's Office accused him of betraying the then marshal of the province to control the plant producing food oil.
He's recently taken a legal action against him.
The appeal was recognized on 12 September.
"The court has maintained its judgment under appeal," confirms Judge Małgorzata Reizer, Advocate of the District Court in Przemysl.
This is a judgment of 14 February issued by the District Court of Industrial Affairs.
Mr Wiśniowski commented on Facebook: “It was six years since I was presented by the Appellate Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin for a alleged violation of the law in telephone conversation with the Marshal of Podkarpacki Voivodship on 30 April 2012.
The court explicitly stated that I was innocent and did not break the law at that time.
I was convinced that my call at the time with Marshal Podkarpackie was in harmony with the law.
The version of events made public in 2013 by the Appellate Prosecutor's Office in Lublin was true and caused irreparable damage to both the food producer and the loss of image of my person with my employers, employees as well as in the local community.
The act of appeal against me in the Court's view contained a number of mistakes, false facts, non-recognition of legal basis, not actually confirmed by events.
CBA helped Rzeszow to eliminate me from public and professional life.
At that time, I was released immediately from work and deprived of my financial resources.
I stayed for a long time to maintain my wife."
Let's remember.
Mr Jerzy Wiśniowski was the Deputy Inspector for the Quality of Trade of Agricultural and Food Articles between 2009 and 2013.
It was withdrawn from its post after the prosecutor's office in Lublin in 2013.
According to the investigators, it was intended to betray the then Marshal of the province (Mirosław Karypita for 4 years of imprisonment) the term of control in the plant producing food oil belonging to the then vice-president of Podkarpackie.
This warning – as the prosecutors in Lublin claimed – was supposed to lead the company's owner to know about the controls and corrected the oil labels that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wiśniewski heard the accusations of overpower, for which he was threatened with imprisonment for up to 3 years.
“ I feel relieved that this case has finally ended and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I did not do anything wrong, which is now the final confirmation is the rightful sentence which accused me of accusations," says Jerzy Wiśniowski.
The White House was trying to hide the records of talks with Zelenski.
In a report made available on Thursday, the signalist wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking to the president of Ukraine, Wolodymyr Złenski, sought to interfere with the foreign state in the election in the US, and the White House tried to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the USA
In an anonymous report dated 12 August, a signalist who is probably an employee of the interview wrote: “As part of my duties, I was informed by many members of the U.S. Government that the President used his function to demand interference of a foreign country in elections in the United States in 2020.”
“Trump has used some of the talks (with Zielenski) to carry out his own interests.
And exactly – he tried to push the Ukrainian leader to take steps to help the president in the re-elect in 2020, to report the report, quoted by the newspaper "The Hill".
Ukrainian leaders were "to understand" that contacts with Trump depend on whether or not "I would prefer to take a game" in matters more specifically that President Rudy Giuliani's lawyer would inform him of.
The author admits that he was not witnessing the conversation, but stresses that he was informed in detail about its content by “many white house officials who had direct information about this” and their relations were covered.
“In the following days after this discussion, I learned from many American officials that high rank representatives of the White House have intervened to “closure” all archive records on this conversation, and especially literal writing, which has been written, as is usually done, in the White House crisis room,” we read further.
“The White House officials have told me that white house lawyers have “infected them” to remove electronic records from the IT system in which such records are stored.
The entry was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate sensitive information", wrote the report author.
“In my opinion, these steps show that White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the talks,” the signalist appreciated.
As the AP comments, this document will probably speed up the procedure for a possible impeachment of the President, and it also contains valuable information about witnesses who may confirm this report.
Start conversations with the Złenski White House, after the pressures of Congress, made it available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of the people who witnessed it.
The contents of the report, in the written version, revealed a day later the committee of the House of Representatives interview.
On Thursday, Joseph Maguire, who was responsible for the U.S. interview, also testified before the House of Representatives' interview and explained how he treated the intelligence officer's report.
Maguire said that the signaler made the right choice and did as he ordered the law.
He also stressed that his view was that talking to Zielenski was a "without a precedent".
The Democrats in the committee asked Maguire why he blocked the availability of a signal report to the Congress; he denied that he had no right to reveal its content, a confidential nature of which guarantees the so-called privilege of the executive authority.
Some of Maguire's interrogation by the board took place behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, President of the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi informed that, in view of the suspicion that the President had put pressure on the authorities of Ukraine to harm his potential rival in the next presidential elections, the House of Representatives will launch an investigation that could lead to the impeachment of Trumpa.
The day later, she assessed that the recording of a talk between Trumpa and Zelenski confirmed that the President of the United States had broken the rules for elections and security.
The US electoral law prohibits the use of foreign state aid.
The Centre of Justice, however, concluded that the President had not broken electoral law. On Thursday, spokesperson of the White House Stephanie Grisham said that there was no "nothing wrong" in the conversation, and in the report "there is nothing more than a set of relationships with the third hand and a glassed press series".
“The White House will continue to criticize this story of the media and the false narrative promoted by the mainstream media”, she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO awards.
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th International Civil Aviation Organisation Meeting (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The safety prize was granted in evidence that Ghana obtained the highest number of air safety surveillance points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 percent of the temporary pace of effective implementation (EI).
This occurred when ICAO completed its ICVM control on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Aviation Agency's Universal Aviation Supervisory Audit Programme.
The security prize was a recognition of the country's high commitment to the implementation of ICAO standards and protocols for protection at airports and in Ghana' airspace.
The prize programme was developed to support the ICAO initiative called No Country Left Beard.
In addition, 16 other safety certificates and 17 security certificates were awarded to ICAO Member States that improved their safety and security standards.
During the release of the prizes for Ghana was the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director-General of the Civil Aviation Office of Ghana, Simon Allotey, Ambassador of Ghana in Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Managing Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, in his speech stressed the need to maintain safety in the airspace by the Member States.
He said: "It is important that we constantly recall that even in the innovation phase, aviation security and sustainable development must remain our primary priorities."
For your part, Mr. Adda noted that the prizes were a huge achievement for the state's efforts because they were a compliment to the industry's hard work and perseverance.
He also added that the aviation industry has a huge potential for developing the country’s economy, saying “aircraft has a powerful opportunity to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but all comes from the security and security that we have achieved."
He danced and ran, stole his bike, too.
A 50-year-old from the town of Zamość was driving under the distributor, refueling and leaving without paying.
That's how he robbed gas stations a few times.
A man also stole a bike from under one of the overseas offices a month ago.
The gas station owners valued the losses of almost 1 thousand zł.
Owner of stolen bike – on PLN 2 thousand.
In the past Tuesday, one of the overseas districts noticed at Wyszyński's audio street, whose owner was suspected of stealing.
A 50-year-old was just behind the wheel.
The man was detained in police custody.
On Thursday, he heard the charges of stealing fuel from four gas stations and a bike.
He confessed to committing these crimes.
Mundur also found the stolen bike.
He'll be back to the owner soon enough.
For stealing a thief, there is a penalty of imprisonment up to the age of 5.
Trump nominees Peter Gaynor as Head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, acting as administrator of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), smiles when he testifys at the meeting of the Senate Budget Subcommittee on National Security on the FEMA budget proposal for the 2020 financial year at the Capital Hill in Washington, USA on 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that on Thursday, President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as Head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor as Deputy Administrator FEMA shall act as the head of the agency that oversees the governmental response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The Agency has been acting without an administrator approved by the United States Senate since March when Brock Long fired this position.
Long resigned after the U.S. State Security Department, which is subject to FEMA, said that Long used government vehicles wrongly to travel between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month when a thorough examination of his past revealed allegations that he was involved in a fight in a bar.
Gaynor's nomination for this position was expected.
To approve his nomination for this role, most of the Senate will be required.
The White House informed that before Gaynor was appointed Deputy administrator of FEMA in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the Marine Corps.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, is considering the amputation of the finger
A 28-year-old runner specialized in the distance of 1500 metres, winning the 2012 Gold Medal of the European Championships (Helsinki), Silver in 2014 (Zurrich) and Brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also Europe’s Deputy Minister for 5,000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this was not a new vigilance and that he had been through one operation just after the 2016 games, but the pains came back and got very intense during the current season.
Pain makes me otherwise put on my foot, which in turn changes the layout of my body, there are other unnatural loads and I begin to feel pain in other places, for example, in the weather.
For this reason, I couldn't prepare myself enough for world championships, and for two weeks pain has been so strong that I have difficulty setting up spikes – said the runner on the TV channel NRK.
Father and coach Gjert Ingebrigtsen admitted that after long discussions with his son, they had come to the conclusion that the only solution not to finish his career and participate in the next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo would be an amputation.
It seems that this is the only one, although the drastic solution and the decision is already in place.
“If part of the body hurts, it should be removed, and in total Henrik does not need that finger so much, and in this situation it should be forgotten cosmetic aspect”, he explained.
Police close the illegal e-apieros factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday, the police closed an illegal factory of e-apieros with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
A raid was made on an office building on 9600 Telstar Avenue about 16:37, during which the police searched for illegal e-apieros containing marijuana and during which large jars containing butane hash oil were found - concentrate from Indian hemps.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano, El Monte P.D. officers also found a device that was used to supplement calcium cartridges.
“This process is very dangerous” – Cano said.
Cano, who used to work with drugs, says that the distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially flammable process.
"The normal electrostatic spark from our clothes can cause the vapours to start, causing not only fire, but due to concentration, even explosion," he says.
“If we have many elephants and the like in the room, after one explosion, there will be another, causing not only a fire, but also an explosion that could drain the whole complex.
A team called for special tasks to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
The value of confiscated products and equipment is unknown at this point.
The detectives say they received an anonymous clue that allowed them to get a search warrant so that illegal activity was detected.
The investigators are still trying to get information on who's behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person responsible set up an interest here because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and the officers want to make sure that illegal products have not reached the street, taking into account recent articles on calcium harmfulness.
“People don’t really know what products they buy” - says Cano.
“They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This could pose a threat to our community and children, and that's why we always keep them from chasing after this kind of thing.
Aphtin withdrawn from the market.
GIF decided on the medicine for the mould
The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspector has informed that he has withdrawn from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine used to treat moulds and yeast infections of the mouth membranes, Gram-positive bacterial infections.
It may also be used as an aid to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product was withdrawn because of the non-compliant quality specification requirements of the product’s fragrance and the decrease in the active substance content.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galen Laboratory in Olsztyn.
Each month, GIF shall issue on average several decisions on the withdrawal of individual product series.
The batches of the product still on the market in Poland can be reinstated after it has been presented with evidence of its safety.
If the medicine is withdrawn, there is no possibility.
Banknot 19 zł – where to buy a collector's banknote about this denomination?
He bears a face of 19 zlotys and shows on it the image of Ignac Jan Paderevski.
In early October, the new collectors banknote – informed the National Bank of Poland.
It's another "Independence" banknote.
It is intended to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the formation of the Polish Securities Manufacturer.
As recorded in the NBP Communication, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented on the ATM.
The date on the banknote, January 25, 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the PWPW Uprising takes place.
Also the nominal value, PLN 19, refers to the year of creation of the Manufacturers" - we read in the NBP Communication.
The watermark presents the image of the eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in PWPW after regaining independence.
The new feature is the holographic strip located on the window on the ground.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignacy Jan Paderevski, and next to the inscription "indie" the image of the Order of the White Eagle was presented.
This letter from Joseph Piłsudski's manuscript is a logo of the 100-year celebration of Poland's recovery of independence.
A series of ligaments, symbolizing fraternity and victory, included a security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of angle effect.
On the side of the reverse banknote there is a image of the building on the background of the panorama of modern Warsaw.
In addition, the PWPW logo features SPARK Live security and an opalescent belt, also visible in UV light in the form of repeating "19" and the "NBP" short - describes NBP.
The banknote is to enter the circulation of 2 October into 55,000 pieces.
One bill will cost 80 zlotys.
All the coins and banknotes issued by NBP, including those from the special series, are legal means of payment in Poland.
However, their nominal value exceeds much the one that can be achieved on the collector market.
The new owner bought it for $500, which is over two million zlotys, for his parents, and decided to transfer the building to Queenstown in Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to Easton port where it was loaded to the bar.
From there he passed the river 50 miles.
Jarosław Kaczyński will vote for the Gosiowska Małgorzata
The President of PiS Jarosław Kaczyński will vote in the upcoming elections for Małgorzata Gosiewska.
"Please do the same", he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczyński and Małgorzata Gosiewska applied for a picture of the banner candidate PiS.
On Friday, Warsaw 'Third' boasted in social media that it would gain the voice of Kaczyński in parliamentary elections.
“Prezes Law and Justice Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński supports Małgorzata Gosiewska”, reports on her Facebook profile.
The boss of the party indicated that it was a sensitive, emotional person and always prepared to carry help.
"I'll give my voice to Margaret Goszowska, and I'm asking you to do the same", he appeals.
The host is running for the Sejm from District 19 (Warsaw) and from the third place on the list.
“The only one” is Kaczyński himself, and the second place is Mariusz Kamiński.
The Book Fair is coming.
We are ahead of us to meet popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
"We're here to break stereotypes.
The inhabitants of Podkarpacia say they don't read books.
We'll show you it's different," said Marta Poltorak during the press conference.
And who will support reading in Rzeszow this year?
As we have heard, the sister of Anostasia, the first Cook of the Republic, will appear at the fair, and also: Lukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bond, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jakub Cwwiek.
This autumn in Millenium Hall will be held a great cultural event – the 22th and 23rd November to the shopping center will take part in the 3rd edition of the Book Fair, which is one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting publishing and bookstores from all over Poland will be at the fair.
There will be 30 of them, including Agara, Mark, SQN, PWN and Black.
At their posts they will present their wide range of publishing and hundreds of book novels, which participants will be able to buy at attractive prices.
Moreover, during two days the fairs will be held unique encounters with writers.
This time, there were invited authors who were writing about important matters and were not afraid to make difficult topics, and they were also winners of prestigious prizes and... they were very prepared.
The list of invited authors is not closed yet.
At the moment, participation in the fairs was confirmed by Łukasz Orbitowski – the winner of the politics passport, Janusz Leon Wiśniewski, the best-seller of "Smots in the Web", and the queen of the Polish Crimea: Katarzyna Bonda.
The star of this year's fair will be Anastasia's sister, the author of several books (including cooks) that sold in over 4 million copies.
Exhibition of the missing dress Elizabeth I at the Hampton Court Palace
The silver threaded dress made of the most distinctive silk kalot was decorated with hafts representing vegetation, animals and butterflies.
For Eleri Lynn, the curators of the Historical Royal Palace Foundation exhibition meant only one thing.
She had a fabric hanging on the wall of the little parish church, which she looked at for 100 years, could only be the lost part of Elizabeth I's dressing.
Three years after Lynn happened to be in an out-of-date altar fabric in Bacton County, Herefordshire, the missing Elizabeth's dress is about to go into an exhibition at the Hampton Court Palace next month, close to the same rooms where the queen of Tudor dynasty could carry it over 450 years ago.
The measure of the significance of this discovery is that from the entire collection of royal dress, only one more element of the 17th-century dress survived.
Although there is no clear evidence that Elizabeth would ever wear this dress, three years of research would strengthen experts in the belief that she had to be part of the royal dressing.
"Silverheads", an incredibly expensive fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtual high quality of embroidered plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears, indicates that the dress belonged to the most prominent of the people.
The dress, during the time it was sewn, could cost the equivalent of Tudor's estate.
"More importantly, in the 1990s, i.e., at the end of Elizabeth's reign, she felt a threat from other women's courtship and would not tolerate rivals wearing such sophisticated fabrics" said Lynn.
“As a very important statement, I asked many people from the environment to look at the dress.
I was really happy to see the dress, and they also loved it, and they were practically convinced that we had a part of the royal dressing.
Long, relive the dress, cut to serve as an altar fabric in the dark church of St Faith in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is a settlement from which Blanche Parry came, the nearest Elizabeth of the lady of the court, which served the queen throughout her long life and with which in local legends the fabric was identified.
Although the dress was formed after her death in 1590, experts believe Elizabeth had to give it to the Parra family or parish to Blanche before her death in 1603.
After over a thousand hours of conservation work, of which four hundred have passed on the delicatest hand sewn by specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles, the altar fabric will go to an exhibition next to the rental time by the Hatfield House Palace on the portrait of "Rainbow Portrait", one of the most famous pictures of Elizabeth dressed in a similar dress.
"When working with historical fabrics, it is really beginning to respect the craftsmen of the people who made them" – says Libby Thompson, head of conservation work, most of whom were held in the reformed glasshouse at the Hampton Court Palace – the only big enough place to accommodate some of the priceless gobelin palaces.
“While looking at the diesel at the front and back, I began to feel a lot of respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The exhibition “The Lost Dress of Elizabeth” will start on October 12 at the Hampton Court
Fitch confirmed Poland's rating with a stable perspective
Fitch confirmed Poland's long-term rating on Friday in the foreign currency at the level of "A-" – given in its Communication.
The outlook for the rating remained stable.
"The Fitch Agency points to the strong macroeconomic foundations and well-diversified economy, which is supported by a reasonably sound economic policy and a strong banking sector", says the Ministry of Finance.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the top of the cyclical cycle and, between 2019 and 2021, the real growth rate of the Brutto National Product in Poland would be 4.1 percent, 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent respectively.
The Agency forecasts that the general government deficit to GDP for 2020-2021 will remain below 3 percent, 2.3 percent and 1.9 percent respectively.
"The government debt ratio to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 percent by the agency, and in subsequent years it will be less (meaning 48.3 percent over the period 2020-2021)", we read.
Saving Poland
The current Polish rating review round on 11 October will end with S&P and Moody's.
The rating of Poland in the evaluation of Fitch remains the same as it was released at the end of March 2019.
The agency then confirmed the Polish rating at the "A-" level with a stable perspective.
Of the three largest credit rating agencies, the highest assessment of Moody's – at the level “A2” is among Poland's highest creditworthiness.
Saving Poland according to Fitch and S&P is “A-”, one level lower than Moody's.
The prospects for all assessments are stable.
What's the rating?
Credit rating agencies are created to help investors assess the risk of their investment activities.
Rating is granted to companies, banks and countries.
For the latter, each assessment translates into economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing other than a creditworthiness assessment.
On the basis of it, decisions are made about who and how much money to lend.
Sometimes such information also suggests who best not to give credit at all, because there is a considerable risk that money will not be able to recover.
A lower rating involves a higher risk.
A higher risk is high interest on credit.
Each assessment must be justified and validated.
Rating can be manipulated, but in this case agencies risk losing their reputation.
At the moment, more than 90 percent of the global market for credit rating services control three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them uses its own assessment system.
Confederate Five: First 1000 plus
“Confederal Fifth”, the main idea of the electoral agenda, presented on Friday in Koszalin the candidates for the Sejm district 40 applying for a mandate from the KW Confederation of Freedom and Independence.
The leader of the Koszalian letter to Sejm Krzysztof Chmielowski presented the password of “the fifth Confederate.”
"First of all, programme 1000 plus for Poland, secondly fast and fair courts, thirdly cultural vouchers and educational vouchers, after fourth national security, after fifth this is a healthy life", said Chmilewski.
He pointed out that "Polishs have to start making good money," which is why the Confederate wants to eliminate income tax and, as Chmilewski said, "the tax-free problem will solve itself."
“The Poles need to give a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and voluntary ZUS for all”, said the leader of the list about the assumptions of “the 1000 plus programme for Poland”.
On the other hand, Alexander Zadenck, starting from the second place of the list, referring to the program’s motto “healthy life” said that “living is getting worse” and in order to change this, it is necessary to "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture", to work for GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederate also advocates the cessation of "stigmatisation of hemps".
Zadencka declared the support of the Confederation for the "development of construction using natural raw materials".
She also said, on behalf of her group, that she was "sustainable vaccinations".
"The right to conscious consent cannot be broken," she added.
The next candidates for the Sejm from the Kosherian district stressed that Confederate was behind "the implementation of the deep reform of the judiciary", which should be part of which, among other things, the examination of the case by the judge "day after day".
They were also told that the educational subsidy would go to schools without local authorities, i.e., without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The Confederate is also behind "a powerful Polish army based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The candidates for the Sejm stressed the need to increase the number of armies.
According to them, there is also a need for easier access to weapons.
On economic issues, they stressed the need for "permanent access to energy".
"We can compensate for coal, we have large deposits of geothermal energy, we also need to consider a return to the idea of a nuclear power plant", said Piotr Karpiński, fifth on the election list.
The Mexican cartel chief is behind a third of the US drugs.
Chicago – just after sunrise at West Side in Chicago, CBS News reported a morning drug chase.
Brian McKnight from the drug control office (DEA) showed in full light what's going on.
Last year, almost 800 people died of drug overdose in Chicago.
McKnight said, "probably, 90%" of Chicago's drugs come from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantes, known simply as El Mencho.
"This is the most important priority for the DEA and directly for the US federal executive bodies", said Matthew Donahue, Head of the DEA in Mexico.
El Mencho's prize is $10 million.
He helped discover tens of El Mencho's drug labs in the jungle.
El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Geneciaon, or CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs reaching the United States by land and sea.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel smuggled "tons" of cocaine, methamphetamines, and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
El Mencho's head is going to be a $10 million prize.
Ironically, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he created a brutal cartel.
It has an enormous amount of weapons, RPG, 50 caliber guns.
In principle, he owns his own SWAT teams," he added Donahue.
El Mencho absolutely protects his empire using measures like shooting a helicopter of the Mexican army, killing six people, or participating in public hanging this summer.
Last year, the brutality of the cartel led to thousands of murders.
According to the Mexican government statistics, about 94 murders occur every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they cannot be handled without protective equipment.
In the cocaine package lab, it's a smuggler brand.
For more than one third of them, traces lead to the El Mencho cartel.
"He is responsible for sending poison that kills innocent women and children," said Donahue.
So when someone's child dies, Donahue says there's a "big chance" that drugs come from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of an overdose.
France: 27-year-olds blackmailed the President of France and his wife
The 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady, says the French prosecutor.
The defendant shall ensure that he has documents compromising the President's couple.
He asked the head of state, among other things, 300 thousand euros in a hothouse.
The man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in France in the police department claims to have received from a person employed in the Elisha Palace “exploiting” documents.
During the hearing, he explained that these documents were not only compromised by the president's couple, but that disclosure could actually jeopardise the security of Macron and the first lady of France.
In exchange for their return, 300 000 euros were required – he also wanted an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters in his previous marriage.
According to the D.A., the defendant refused to hand over the documents he was talking about.
He announced that he would hand them over to the media – but so far it is not known whether these documents really exist.
They weren't found during the search at the apartment of that 27-year-old.
A man has been undergoing psychiatric research, but the doctors have not identified any serious disorders.
The PS4 game will be old-school – Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony throws more light on the debuting game soon available exclusively on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony announced in the recent presentation of State of Play that the premiere of The Last of Us will take place in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new portion of the breathtaking game in the breasts of the upcoming action game.
More details were revealed in the days following the loud premiere of The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are reaching for old school climates in many ways.
The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several tiles.
Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in a sensational interview given by The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel spread to one of the greatest games in history.
"The plot is ambitious and mixed with aspects where one was not," he said.
It must have been so extensive to be able to present this kind of story with so many characters.
We weren't going to create the coolest game, that's just how it happened.
"We are excited about how many possibilities are in this story. There will be moments when you think you're going to the end, but you'll realize it's just the beginning and that the whole new chapter begins," Druckmann says.
It's such an ambitious game that it didn't fit on one BluRayu and it's on two tiles.
In another place it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two Eater eggi content for adults (information provided by Gamespot).
We will not spoil surprises, but the easter egogi will refer to Naughty Dog's old-school works.
Learn more when The Last of Us: Part Two will debut on 21 February 2020 only on PS4.
People with PS4 can prepare for the premiere of the Sequel, reaching for The Last of Us Remastered available in PS Plus.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, including the above production of Naughty Dog.
PS Plus subscribers will also have since October access to the MLB The Show 19.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to make a pre-premier order for a sequel, Sony said that there will be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing a replica of Ella's backpack and its bracelets and a 30-inch figure of this iconic character.
Run, twirl and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil will take Podbeskid and want to win.
Stomil players from three tracks are invincible.
Peter Związkowski's sleepers won seven points at that time because they won with Stala Mielec and Chojnicka Chojnice, and in the last match he fell a barren draw in Suwałki.
Now the Olsztyn team will take Podbeskid on Saturday 18 p.m., which is listed as one of the fans for promotion to the Extraclass.
The nearest Stółmil rivals take the fourth place in the table and have an advantage over the Olsztyn team.
The Podbeskid on the trips this season played six times and it counted two wins, draws and defeats, while Stomil is very well at his facility – at the stadium at al. Piłsudski 69 of the team Piotr Zzązkowski won three times and lost once.
They gathered 17 points in total in ten lines and are in the top of the table, although after two failures at the start of the game, nothing announced.
"Every change takes time to produce results," explains Piotr Skiba.
“And in the end, we got sick, and we believed in ourselves, and we could work under normal conditions.
We're just focusing on playing ball.
There's clean heads, there's a good atmosphere, and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomil footballers were eliminated from the Polish Chorz movement Cup, but they needed a series of criminal shots and recordings.
At the south of Poland, Peter Skib, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc were not taken to Poland because Zzązkowski had let these key players rest before Saturday's dance with Podbeskid.
In Croatia, however, he played a returnant after the injury of Jakub Mosakowski, who finally shot his long-awaited goal.
“It’s always fun to get a goal, and I’ve come to such a moment that we can continue to play in the cup (Mosakowski equals 3:3 in 119th mine - red.).
Dad used to bite me and laugh that I couldn't get the gate, and I always told him I'd shoot at the moment he wasn't expecting it."
Now Mosakowski counts to return to its basic composition, especially because of yellow cards he cannot play Olesh Tarasenko.
“After that, I take the training hard to play in the first set,” says Mosakowski.
“In Croatia, I did everything I could to present myself best.
But whether I'm going to play or sit on the backup bench, I'm going to support the team as hard as I can.
Because the most important thing is the team and three points in the Podbeski game.
I'm sure there's a difficult meeting for us in which victory will have to run out, break out and fight."
In the middle of the Olsztyn defense, Rafał Remis may still play, who has also been injured recently, so whether he will appear, we will only find out on Saturday, even more so that Coach Zzuzkowski traditionally tries to keep things secret until the end of the matter.
A man raped and murdered a niece
“You will never see the light of the day.
You will never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, addressing Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so disgusting and mean that you had to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Its search lasted five days until Whipple indicated the location of the body's hiding.
"How could anyone have done this to his own niece?" Dejay Smith, a little girl's uncle, asked.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," he said to Alex Whipple.
"I would give anything to meet her again, hug her," said the mother of a murdered girl.
"Our life will never be the same," the wife added.
According to Fox News, 22-year-old Whipple never showed any emotion during questioning.
Last month, he admitted that he kidnapped, took sexual advantage, and murdered a girl.
A man's lawyer said that his client grew up in "a perfect family."
He was supposed to be molested as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he committed a terrible act and was willing to punish him.
A man was sentenced to life without the possibility of seeking parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would hand over nearly $100 million more money to the communities affected by the drought.
The scheme providing money to farmers affected by the drought will be extended and the criteria for the allocation of additives on the holding will be simplified.
The package of aid measures covers almost $34 million for the support initiative for the drought-affected communities, so that eligible farmers can receive up to $3,000 in emergency accidents.
Each of the 13 local government areas in the Framework Programme will receive up to 1 million dollars of infrastructure grants and assistance in managing the consequences of the disaster.
The new support package is an addition to more than 7 billion dollars allocated by the government to the drought fund.
Frostpunk – a strategic game that combines the features of the production of the city-builder with the unique simulator of the 19th-century society and the cold survival – is approaching the planned prime minister on October 11th.

Chinese treachery (In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters)
Documentary film: In China, the divorce rate has doubled in the last decade.
The reason for this was generally caused by third parties.
More and more men maintain their relationship beyond marriage, which led to the development of a particular sector in this country – professional smothering lovers to save their wives.
Let's scan it out: Ma-te-huch!
Trying to welcome the Prime Minister to the Silesian Piekars
A personal general test was carried out before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in the Silesian Piekary.
“Sirence, louder, louder, so we will not welcome the Prime Minister here!
Let us scan loudly: Ma-te-ouch!", encouraged the leaders to work hard.
Unfortunately, the enthusiasm efforts of the waterman did not bring the desired result.
An electoral campaign in progress.
Politicians go all over the country, convincing themselves voters.
The campaign is also run by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who, as leader of the Silesian list of PiS, is a frequent visitor in this region.
Each meeting is well planned, including appropriate repairs.
That was the case, but rather – it was supposed to be, in Silesian Piekars.
Can be told – a special guest should be greeted especially.
Before meeting with the Prime Minister, he decided to conduct a trial in the lead room.
He tried to encourage the crowd to chant the name of the head of government.
"This will not be my welcome, but for Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!
Also louder, louder my dears!", encouraged the dissented one.
Unfortunately, the crowd was not fully kidnapped by the hot force of the driver and eagerly responded to the "Ma-te-ouch", but the recording of enitusist váreja makes fur in the network.
Ronald Lee Haskell: Male convicted for murdering his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of the murder of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the Stay House on 9 July 2014, requesting the disclosure of the whereabouts of his wife, Melannie Haskell, with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay, and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls who were nine and seven died when Haskell opened fire, as Harris Sheriff's Office claims.
There was only one family member, then Cassidy Stay 15 years old.
The authorities said she was badly hurt, but she managed to recover completely.
On Thursday, jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of imputability.
The jury will gather again on Monday to give judgment.
Quantum Internet Getting Closer Reality – ScienceDaily
The results of the U.S. Army research are moving quantum internet one step closer.
Such a internet could offer military security opportunities, detection and accuracy not available in traditional approaches to networking.
The Center for the Disaster Military Information Processing of the Military Research Laboratory for the Development of the American Army Commandling was looking at researchers from the University of Insbruck who managed to achieve a record transfer of state entangled between matter and light – 50 kilometres away with fibre cables.
This confusion is a correlation that can be formed between quantums such as Cubans.
When two cubics are confused and measured by one of them, it will have an impact on the measurement made on the other, even if the other key is physically remote.
“Te [50 km] is two rows of size further than previously possible and this is a feasible distance to start construction of intercity quantum networks” said Dr. Ben Lanyon, experimental physics from the University of Innsbruck and chief researcher in a project that was published in the Nature magazine, the Quantum Information section.
Intercity quantum networks would consist of distant nodes of the physical cords, which are connected to each other despite a high distance of physical.
The researchers found that this dispersal of the state entrenched is essential for the creation of quantum internet.
"This demonstration is a significant step forward in order to achieve a large-scale scattered state", said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-organising military programme to support these studies.
The quality of the state connected to the second end is also high enough to meet some of the requirements of the most difficult quantum network applications.
The study team started an experiment with a calcium atom trapped in a ion trap.
With the help of laser beams, researchers put quantum state in ion, at the same time encouraging it to emit photons in which quantum information was recorded.
As a result, the quantum state of the atom and the particles of light were confused.
The challenge is to send a photon to a fibre cable.
“Foton emitted by calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometres and is quickly absorbed by the fibre”” said Lanyon.
Therefore, his team initially sent a part of the light through a nonlinear crystal illuminated with a strong laser ray.
The length of the photon wave was converted to an optimal value from the point of view of the transmission to large distances – the current standard telecommunications wavelength is 1550 nanometres.
Then the researchers sent this photon through a 50-kilometre fibre cable.
Their measurements show that the atom and the particles of light were still connected even after the wavelengths were transformed and the distance was passed.
‘The choice of calcium means that this result is a direct path to creating a confused nuclear clock network at long distances of physical physical life, as calcium can be co-incided with a high-quality "zegara" key.
The army is very much interested in confused clock networks built on a large scale due to the use of precise position fixing, precise navigation and time synchronization" – said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-organises the program.
