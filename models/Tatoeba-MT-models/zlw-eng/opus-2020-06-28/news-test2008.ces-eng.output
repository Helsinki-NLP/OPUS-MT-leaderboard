Inflation in Europe jumped for food
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to a constant rise in food prices.
The November price growth in 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was registered, announced by the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union.
According to Bloomberg, the official forecast was only 3 percent.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian Emissions Banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate by reducing together with rising raw material prices and falling unemployment would lead to the creation of inflation spirals.
The ECB would like to maintain inflation rates below two percent, but close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must "reimbursement" the inflation, so that it doesn't have to do anything later.
In Germany, November inflation represents 3.3 percent of the 15-year-old record, and in Spain it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area went up due to rising food and energy prices.
The wheat prices rose by 88 percent, also the soy exchange rate reached the highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007, it was necessary to pay substantially more for edible oil and milk products.
The price of oil on world markets has increased by 52 percent this year and last month it has already cost one black gold barrel almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will fall from 2.1 percent this year to 2.5, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the level of 12 months of inflation will remain approximately 3 percent in the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will remain 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce the interest rate immediately during 2008.
Gallp sees a government crisis
Fidesz movement circle has increased significantly in early December, and so now it has been the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the socialists of Gallipup Institute so low - 13 percent support has never been achieved.
In the case of certain voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71 %) aid compared to the 5th MFA support.
MDF and SZDS are, according to a survey, below the threshold for entry into Parliament: their support throughout the population is 2%.
Among certain voters of the party, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The public opinion in the economy has deteriorated even given the previous mini - it has never been the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very bad, so high - 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent the situation is bad.
The families assess the change in their material situation after spring and summer hopeier prospects now more pessimistic.
With regard to next year, the larger part of the population is calculated with a further deterioration and only a tenth with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of the questions were made, most of all of Gallp's recent surveys that the Prime Minister was doing his work rather badly than well.
The Ferenti Gyurcsany believes or very trusts 13 percent of the questions, while Viktor Orban's share is 38 percent.
The Prime Minister doesn't believe 54 percent, the chairman of the Fidesz movement 27 percent.
One indicator of political developments is how much of the public considers that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While, after last October's riots, the government and Prime Minister considered it desirable 35 percent, this share is now only 20 percent, with the relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in writing new elections.
To the interest in the referendum, it is evident that 60 percent of the questions raised were answered regarding their possible participation, that it would certainly come to the referendum and that another 20 percent would probably come.
In comparison, 'parliamental elections organised this Sunday' would certainly take place only 55 percent and another 15 percent would consider their participation as likely. The success of the referendum would be unfamiliar on the basis of the current intentions.
The school would say no 74, doctor's fees 79 and hospital charges of 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the series of people promising their participation, then the introduction of school fees, doctor fees and hospital fees would reject 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth was assassinated by Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs commercial triangle last year preserved, on average 16 percent price level growth, with the difference that no VAT increase was achieved this year.
Article of the newspaper Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság daily in Budaörskie’s business triangle grew by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets the price showed an increase of over a thousand forints.
Since the prices in the supermarkets "exhibited" in December last year, percentagely due to the earlier high base did not appear so drastic.
However, it is unfortunate for the consumer that what they could have purchased last year at a price of under nine thousand forints will not now be provided for ten thousand.
The daily economy consumption basket in studied hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer basket was 6,800 forints.)
The Unica price and live fish remained so much at last level, but they were very much undercut by breasts, nuts and also poppy.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchun we found a kilogram bread for 139 forints.
Competition did not go with the product price below 200 forints.
Similarly, it was surprising in this shop that the price of the two-litre Coca Coly in the bottle was below 200 forints, so also the product was only 257 forints.
However, this year, he appeared according to the consumable basket of the Napi Gazdaság Auchan daily as the most expensive, while Cora as the cheapest.
According to our calculations, it raised prices in the consumer basket of the Napi Gazdaság daily due to the prices last year at Cora Christmas by 15, while Tesco and Auchan about 18 percent.
When comparing last year's highest and this year's lowest value for consumer basket, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's highest is 21 percent.
In the forints there was an increase on average 1 480.
The average price increase last year was 1 206 forints, with prices affected by VAT growth last year.
It is precisely this process of trade that the trading homes have turned, clearly, could not decide how large the price margins are to be established for each product, since they could not predict what effect the price change would have on consumption.
(If the trader plans the rate of circulation of the product in question badly, the price margin adapted to the intensity of circulation may lose a significant profit.)
Due to VAT, last year’s consumer basket price of Napi Gazdaság showed so extremely that the price of the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest price difference of all 844 forints.
This year, the extreme difference did not appear, the most expensive basket now stood by 1 630 forints more than last year, and also the cheapest one 1 284 forints.
Compared to both Christmas seasons, catastrophic price increases showed, less than 20 months later, the daily consumption of hypermarkets was under threat of more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, not absolutely confirms the data of the Central Statistical Office: this measured in the case of several basic foods an increase in prices exceeding 30 percent within 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example for eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the consumable basket Day’s economy it seems so impossible, because the price level of the product, which was already expensive last year, was hardly more than 10 percent due to the basis even in the worst case of price growth.
The producers of flour seem to have taken a stronger position than egg suppliers, and they managed to sell drastically in international chains.
Hypermarkets in a commercial gold triangle do not complain, they still prefer a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in three visited stores no longer care about prices.
They buy all the quantum, durable food on a salary basis.
In the middle of the morning, all three supermarkets formed long queues near the ticket, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, there is a lower turnover in the countryside, many international chains complaining to research firms that the markets are behind their plans, not only in the case of food but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, they are saved in disinfectants.
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection were registered in hospitals due mainly to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The health conditions of hospitals, overfishing the beds, the overload of the staff of the outbreak do not help, claims the primary of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, they also serve in disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatological department of St. John's hospital.
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics were discovered in a man who got to the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site earlier this year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after that, he had to return to the MRSA infection and due to the bacteria found in his body also could not be performed by one important operation.
By December 10, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resisting disease agents were reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistive disease agents have been registered in hospitals with certainty, others are not aware of.
Almost two-thirds (683) infections were caused by MRSA, or methicilin-oxaclin resistant gold staphylococa.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carry a third of people in the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e. g. blood inflammation, manli inflammation, skin infection, wound infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, when antibiotics are administered in excess or inappropriate, bacteria are derived from well-reactive to antibiotics of bacteria which are very resistant to antibiotics and which are rapidly spread in non-responsible hospital conditions.
First of all, in case of transient or permanent poor functioning of the immune system in patients with impaired body, low body weight or in patients in years of age may cause serious hospital infections, such as an early infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the chief physician of St. John's hospital, nothing special about MRSA infection, similar to those of hospitals, is daily practice.
"Infection must not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulas, "where the presence of the disease producer is not examined."
Resilient to antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the personnel who are handling them in rubber gloves and masks, and we have the necessary antibiotics for their treatment," Tibor Nyulas said.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined if they are present in their MRSA, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in mode
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be avoided, but current circumstances and conditions in home hospitals are not favourable to prevent the formation and spread of multi-resisting agents, claims Karolina Böröczová.
As these infections occur in hospitals and senior homes, patients should be monitored by the hospital and MSA carriers immediately.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in style.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these examinations.
The most cases are thus revealed if the patient suffers from an acute infection of the MRSA, the primary of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also home directives for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
There is a need to seek targeted antibiotics therapy, or a microbiological examination should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but even in all cases the hospital does not follow.
The collection of microbiological samples is even more rare in basic and outpatient treatment of patients, said Karolina Böröczová.
It is used in disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most often spread among patients through medical personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in washing hands and using gloves and masks, but even in hospitals there are serious shortcomings.
MRSA is transmitted to liquid infections and touch, but in the conditions of home hospitals it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be within a minimum of 1,5 metres.
As Karolina Böröczová noted, unfortunately, we can also meet the fact that there is little in hospitals found in the adverse material situation, saving for disinfectants, nurses and patients, thus increasing the chances of developing infections.
According to Karolina Böröczová, where the necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections prove less or can be stopped further spread by the disease producer.
MRSA Government Programme
The treatment of MRSA infection represents a huge cost for health insurance companies, therefore fighting against it everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has drawn up a programme to prevent the MRSA and to reduce its occurrence.
As it appears, the program is successful, according to published data, reports the infection of MRSA in England with a decreasing trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) includes preventing the emergence of multi-resistent disease agents (including MSSA), and hospital infections caused by these disease agents, among their priorities.
A police captain who caused a fatal accident was not drunk.
Official expert review in the case of police captain XXII. district, which caused a fatal accident, is finished.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXII district, who killed the pedestrian on Tuesday and who in the meantime resigned from his function, ran under the influence of alcohol or hallucinations, would inform the spokesperson of the Supreme State Prosecutor of Attila Morvai on Friday after completion of the expert assessment of this case.
The expert report confirmed the outcome of the initial investigation, which already stated that the former police captain had not lived any alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
The director of Police Directorate XXII then hit Lajose Kosutha on Tuesday in the XXII district with his own personal car at the turn of a 25-year-old man who entered the vehicle crossing outside the marked transition.
(The latter is named as the fact that the pedestrian passed outside of the zebra, in fact according to the rules of road traffic, is not easier, the turning car must still give priority.)
After transport to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
As a result of this incident, the District Police Director resigned from office and requested to be transferred to duty, according to the police report, because the case was so shaken.
In the case of Budapest's investigation, the State Prosecutor's investigation is carried out.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had cooperated with the state officials conducting the investigation from the start.
Other €400 million in infrastructure
The agreement of three credit frameworks worth a total of EUR 400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy infrastructure was signed on Friday in Budapest by the Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 the Hungarian budget financing of transport and the environment projects implemented by the Cohezne Fund, a framework worth EUR 300 million, with the parties already entered into a loan contract of EUR 100 million, now signed with respect to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement is also used for budget financing of projects linked to education.
The EIB approved EUR 300 million for Hungary for these purposes, the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with the extension of the credit contract.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which will apply the budget mainly to the research-development project of the University of Debrecín.
The meeting was also discussed on the 4th metro route.
The Parties agree that after Hungary has negotiated the details of EU funding, it will return to whether and how the original contract needs to be modified.
This can occur in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has funded a total of EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary since 1990.
The interest of the EIB that is granted by an eight-year waiting period and without a binding commission is linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is stunning - the attention of all of Europe is turning to a bit of a previously forgotten Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying the cheapest, but with the rapidly killing EU market?
Analyses of the Bulgarian division of the company Re/Max.
The most wanted Eastern European objective of buying real estate is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and seafront houses.
From the mountains are the most in the course of the area of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast then Albena, Gold sands, the sunny coast, the ancient towns of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also searching for properties in the vicinity of the Kavarna and Balčik.
According to the analysts from the company Re/Max Bulgaria will sooner or later raise the interest of investors and the central part of the country - e.g. Veliko Tarnovo, Gabro, Elena, Triavna - and more and more interested parties also buy in the vicinity of the cheap city of Russia.
The capital of Sofia is also a promise of attractive possibilities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to change into one of Europe's most attractive golf havens, and thus to become next to the summer and winter seasons looking for the destination of travel in the next two seasons.
Predicted investors are already buying large ones, such as Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most customers come from England, but also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and more often also from Romania are coming.
There are also Maltese and Cyprus investors, near the Black Sea, and in ski havens there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign ski buyers split into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who are about to buy refurbished properties worth EUR 50-100 000, or lost old homes for EUR 5-15 000, then renovating.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, it is important for them to have a great city, shops and generally a local doctor.
The second category is chat buyers (Bulgaria took place in December among the first 10 German recreational objectives).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of rising values in the medium to long term.
Real estate treatment in the capital is continuous, as demand is increasing.
While the lowest prices are in Bulgaria in the European Union, over the last five years, 21 percent have grown annually.
Real estate price increases significantly exceed the growth of wages.
Fodore and Hungarian six percent
According to information from the Minister of the Environment and Water Management of Gábor Fodora, the meeting of experts will be completed on Tuesday and after the Wednesday official launch, the international conference on the climate regime after 2012 will continue with the meeting of ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are acting on a road map from Bali, which addresses efforts following the period of reduction of emissions defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At the moment, there is a stormy debate between developing and developing countries.
The United States has also announced that they do not now want to deal with exact numbers, although they are attached to the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 due to the 1990 state.
Another big question about the conference is whether the developed country will, in addition to reducing emissions, also contribute to providing both material and technological assistance to the countries that have been referred to it.
The agreement has also been born on subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, set by the Kyoto Protocol, will be held by the 16-member management board, probably in the framework of the UN World Environmental Programme (GEF) - can be read in the Piac és Profit magazine.
Hungary 6 percent
The Minister for the Environment and Water Management of Gábor Fodoř on behalf of Hungary supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in the efforts to achieve global climate protection and to help develop a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the " post-2012 agreement", and is ready to commit itself to up to 30 % reduction in the event that other developed world areas, respectively developed countries are willing to accept responsibility and commitments corresponding to their possibility.
Gábor Fodorn pointed out that the countries which joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 met the target of a reduction of 5.2 percent, with 15 EU Member States committed to 8 percent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country will fulfill. - is mentioned in the Ministry of Environment's press release.
It is a great deal in Bali because it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy within two years, otherwise its entry into force would have shifted until 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately entail a new system for reducing emissions, the need for which the UN international scientific congregation dealing with climate change – IPCC, which bears the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in average temperatures on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would be extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting YouTube
British military units publish recordings from actions in Iraq and Afghanistan on a shared video server that they popularize themselves.
First YouTube has liked British Air Force (RAF): since March 2006, the BBC has reported videos from the Taliban actions.
The recordings, controlled by a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Command by the Kandahar fighting operation and then sent further to London, where they are transferred to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
This form of the Internet already received 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers and more than 75,000 people looked at their "channel".
The British Defense Ministry registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Deployment in Afghanistan
Air force has published videos according to its original intention for recruitment and according to the Ministry of Defense, they are also good to meet the general public with the real aim of the presence of the army abroad.
"The promotion published in this form, as opposed to traditional television recruitment advertising, almost nothing is worth," the BBC told the defence expert Gordon Mackenzie, "but it also necessarily carries a political message, because the special form confirms the right of military actions which the government has decided."
Americans made a game
The Army is concerned that next to carefully modified, censored recordings also receive amateur videos, including the death of soldiers: in a bit of hypocrisy, 'official' promotional films, officers are speaking most about losses, but it does not seem to be a bloody like fighting.
After all, many videos from battleships in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been received on the Internet, which was created in sharp deployment, but the British army has come to them now.
Americans carry out recruitment a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which a player can get through more or less loyal simulation directly into the skin of soldiers.
The Ministrys will be Christmas with a tombolou and peacocks.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth is obviously not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, he organizes a final working meeting for his coworkers, where he will partake of the peacocks and coffee with 2007.
There will be a celebration at some departments with live music, where the officials of the Christmas ambience and a toast.
Dinner, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - so enjoys power.
State authorities are preparing for Christmas as well.
This year, the Ministry of Defense will hold the most important Ministerial Christmas celebration, but it does not expect its employees.
At Christmas, orphans will receive gifts from fallen soldiers, family members of soldiers serving at present at foreign missions, but will also arrange reception for journalists.
The Resort is dedicated to the atmosphere of the end of 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) will throw out of the coves against other resorts.
The GKM party is held in the center of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4 320 000 forints and of six hundred staff of the Ministry is expected to be approximately three hundred 50 guests.
The resort will stick to Christmas traditions at its party, but there will also be various performances and a torbob will happen.
Christmas NFÜ stood 4,700 000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Justice Council (OIT) - there were concerts and dinners on the program.
The hall rental cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one NFÜ department is still invited to another Christmas celebration: here it is organised by a company providing the course of tends, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
To this end, they rented the building of the Vígszínách Theatre.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information because we failed to reach the person concerned.
No suit needed
The OIT building did not leave only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which was organised by St. Lucie on December 7th.
However, OIT did not want money from him by using its halls.
The ball was attended by 500 people.
The party began with a health minister, after dinner it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question of the [origo] portal at the ball, there was no mandatory evening dress or suit at all.
The Purity parties are preparing health, work and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and a celebration for employees for 400 000 forints in its own building.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth's co-workers even officially does not attend a Christmas party, but at a final meeting.
There are only 100 80 guests who, according to the press department, receive coffee and peacocks, so only 350 000 forints will be enough for the party.
Gordon Bajnai and his co-workers will simply join the Ministry for Local Governments and Regional Development in the Hall.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting, expected by 436 employees, in its own large hall.
At Christmas party 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes reception with Swedish tables and toast.
Since Minister János Veres has been celebrating Christmas in a similar way every year.
The atmosphere of the party will, however, be missing, the officiality will increase not only the minister's speech, but also the afternoon's event.
The resort of agriculture is held on January 20th of the New Year's reception, the minister's Christmas is not taking place.
The reception will take place in the Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the Municipal Gardens and according to the Ministry's statement, 1,000 forints per person are intended for 100 guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception at which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short health minister and end with minor cleaning.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture of Christmas parties do not hold at all, has communicated the relevant press department to the [origo] portal.
The award of the Christmas celebrations of the environmental resort in the press department could not be communicated.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to the party organized by the Museum of Industrial Arts.
It's heading for a giant strike.
The Union of Trade Unions of the League, respectively the National Union of Workers Councils (MOS), will establish their strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday's unlimited strike.
On Saturday there is a protest public meeting, Monday - on the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - the work will be stopped.
The event will certainly cause serious interruption of transport because the railway transport will almost completely stop and the staff of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also stop within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, she will meet the League association, along with the national union of work councils, with details jointly organised Monday strike.
There will also be a strike committee LIGA - MOS, which will coordinate Monday's action.
On Saturday there is a protest public assembly, then from Monday, the union joining the station will stop work for an indefinite period if there is no agreement with the government.
This means that the date of termination of the strike will not be set, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not accept the Health Insurance Act in the end, the unions will immediately withdraw the call to strike.
However, if the legislation is voted out, the strike committee will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to the Parliament's Monday show, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will vote only in late evenings or night hours.
On Monday, starting strike, it is possible to count on serious traffic interruptions: the railway will be stopped for an indefinite period; in the morning, part of Budapest public transport and more than half of Volán can stop.
At the same time, there will also be a half-way closure in many places in the country.
Many trade unions and civil organisations have joined the call to strike, the list of which is constantly updated on the website of the League association.
Some organisations have introduced a strike for an indefinite period, others have declared temporary termination of work.
By Thursday afternoon, Hungary’s State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDCS) could not agree on enough services, but more and more people travel at the beginning of Christmas holidays on rail.
According to previous communications, from the beginning of the operation to 13 hours, BKV will take place, from 7 to 9 hours in the morning at Budapest Airport, four-hour strike will be organised by the Medical Union of Workers in the energy industry LIGA, to 2, respectively, a 2-8-hour termination of the work called upon by the Department of Education and the Democratic Union of Education.
The marriage of Hungarian doctors will stand alternately throughout the country, the Democratic Union of Workers in Health and Social Affairs (EDDS), which belongs to the Cooperative Forum of trade unions (SEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the Liga association is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and submit a new concept to the public debate.
The second requirement is for a new way of calculating pensions to be introduced gradually from next year.
Third, in order to ensure the possibility of inclusion in the system of early retirement for the relevant working groups before 2010.
The fourth reason for the event is that the independent trade union of railway employees (VDSEZ), falling under the Liga trade union, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport concerning railway branch offices, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungary's garden increased the risk of the country
The activity of Hungary's guards, based on the support of the Jobbik Magyarszágért movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of the Political Capital Institute increased the political risk of Hungary as well as the whole area in a few respects.
In the "risk notice" developed by the company is written: in connection with the activities of Hungary's Guards, the largest political risk is that "the focus of the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and the non-Roma population of Hungary can already be violent ethnic conflicts."
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to provoke such an action - it adds the research institute.
As he writes, all this can be explained by the biggest negligence of Hungarian political leaders: "the public debate on Romani issues has been left to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could oppose the Roma-Maďar Strategy."
This problem deepens, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - the Institute is judging.
Moreover, Hungary's activities according to the research institute have influenced the great attention of domestic and foreign media "to a large extent demonstrated the picture of Hungary abroad, especially as regards faith in stability of the country and its democratic maturity".
The Institute recalls: a part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-pravive groups, which has been becoming increasingly public and vehemities since autumn 2006, it is that, since the summer of 2007, several organizations have been formed, which themselves are called "national dombies".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while they openly preach - and armed - preparedness of their members to carry out defensive tasks (in the case of natural disasters, assault of the country, corruption), in addition to the incompetence of police, military, or state," he adds.
He also notes: this is all happening in a way that tries to wrap up various political efforts built on the resistance of society to politics and the parties to the civilian table.
Thus, emphasising civility and the form of association in the case of these groups does not only serve to avoid legal satisfaction of legal registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of Hungary's garden is also a factor increasing risk from neighbouring relations.
"In recent months, they point to Hungary's City right in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, ultra-national political representatives of some neighbouring countries, by appealing to the emergence of Hungary's Guards, want to apologize their own anti-Maddar policy.
All this can affect the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the research institute, the emergence of Hungary's guards in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so that political risks for the area are increased as a whole.
The Hungarian Guard activity is similar, for example, to the activity of Bulgaria’s National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-pravicial Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, the mass Romani riots, which broke out in one of the Sofian Quarters (Krasna Poljana).
That BNU used to establish a garden with the aim of an organization being a "national domain".
In the past 17 years, it seems that “Ciccan terror” has been found in Bulgaria, but the state remained ineffective and indifferent, resembling the Institute of Political Capital.
It adds that the initiative sparked a stormy debate on the Bulgarian public.
As he writes, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts signales the announcement of some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will create their own City on the sign of resistance.
As Hungary’s previous activities show similarities with the activity of Bulgaria’s National Guards, it is not excluded that Hungarian Roma are going to respond to a threat in a similar way, setting up their own domain, we can read on the risks raised by the Institute of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, a research director of the Political Capital Institute, asked about the press office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, risk analysis shall be issued each year and if it finds out something that might affect a change of risk, they shall inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing risk alerts.
Holidays are not available everywhere
In Hungary, the days are set exactly by law and it has become common practice that work days are moving around the holidays, which we expect less in the next year.
There are no uniform holidays in the European Union or in America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and working days.
The working days of peace tend to be influenced by church holidays or significant historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is the working day of the new year - for the New Year so that people can rest from New Year's Eve.
During the year we have a different total of 11 free holidays.
The national holiday is March 15th, celebrating the revolution from 1848 and 23rd October, the memorial day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, we celebrate the establishment of the State, May 1, 1st, and 2nd, we remember dead relatives and friends.
Besides, there are two-day Easter, Holidays and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend calendar, it has become an experience of moving the working day in cases where we should only work one day before or after the holidays.
But the price for extended weekends is that the previous Saturdays remain in the workplace and in school.
The day that immediately precedes or follows the holiday, we will have worked out, for many years, adjusting the Minister of Labour in a special decree.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employed workers, to public employees and persons in the public service.
However, companies and institutions which are in operation without interruption or having regard to their destination are also working on working days.
This year, there will be a change in the working order only around the holidays of the end of the year: from 24 December, life in the country will be almost stopped, because according to experience of the past, most people will take a "premise" days between Christmas and New Year's Eve or use their saved holiday in advance.
In the next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle, respectively at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar turns around the holidays of work so that the workers can stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday 26th April will be a working day so that it may be Friday, 2nd May, the day of rest.
Another move is related to Sunday 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be working place on Friday 24.
The end of the year, however, will be able to take place entirely in the sign of the holidays, since from 24 December, they will have almost everywhere on holiday even though New Year’s Eve seems to be on Wednesday.
Six appalling little things that you can upset your colleagues
E-mails that we will forget to send, voice messages that we will never receive, innocent lies, which we will never notice anymore: all this "breathes" daily in the workplace.
The question is, if you get used to these little discomforts, or put on gloves and unclear situations that can upset others, you'll be deliberately avoiding.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague will tell you.
That you missed a meeting because of that?
In a better case, he regrets it and tries to correct it, or he calls into the marketing department and says that the message has forgotten to be passed (it is less common solution).
Most often, the thing is solved by one excuse.
Before there is embarrassing apologies, it is good to think about what you might want your colleagues to prepare uncomfortable moments, and knowingly try to prevent it.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than getting in for writing, office need or your phone, and they're not there.
Remember, you put a stapler on your desk yesterday, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you find one of your colleagues on the table a pen you thought was lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues, otherwise you will be rightly angry with them in matters.
Do not remove envelopes or adhesive paper from your office, because it may be uncomfortable if you arrive early, and you will need them immediately.
Is this about a private life of colleagues?
There's no good solution to stop the pliers spreading.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don't hang up on everyone's nose your messages about a private life of colleagues!
If any of them share their inner secret with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in yourself what you have heard, and in his absence do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when they know about his things.
Are you reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call your office and appeal to the strong headache you report your absence because you're not well, or you're saying that today you'd rather rest, think that your work, inexpensive tasks and work that have a certain term, someone else will have to do for you.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know ahead that the next day you are not going to work, or something that may happen that you will have to stay home for, report that your colleagues and leaders will not be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Snacking, hustling, phone calls
Did you dive into work, out of which a colleague will harden you?
Are you going to become a witness to a phone conversation that's better not to hear?
Do not interfere with your colleagues by whispering, singing, speaking loudly (by speaking above your head) or by assing, constantly knocking, the voice of dissatisfaction.
All of this could be disturbing even when they're not actually prevented into a project (written, planning, organization).
Are you accusing the other guy of making mistakes?
If something is not in time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or a message, do not blame yourself for your oblivion!
Do not call upon any chaos in office and noisy colleagues!
Admit it if you've been wrong and someone's paid off, and fix it!
Ask him how you could get things right, fix your negligence!
Do you feel too comfortable in the office?
Heatpers and parrots: comfortable home clothes, but it's not good for the office!
Do not take clothing for free time, even if it permits your profession!
Don't be careless, honour your colleagues and yourself by coming to your office in regular clothes - and if your profession requires nice and elegantly!
If you want to fit, you stop being interesting.
I've been in the morning traffic since I got here.
Special melodies will be heard from the radio: the violin sound that electronic effects are attached to.
I'm adding volume.
Music changes the pace and the bass is added to the previous totone colour, then as a real jewel the female congregation joins.
At the station, the mr2 is the composition of the Zagar group called Wings of Love.
The home musical life has long failed to spoil us with high-quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, the curtain looks quite different, because you're listening to the new Zagar album.
The revelation of Yonderboie, a couple of new and interesting productions originating from the home digital underground slowly changes the picture, and although it is again in the fashion garage rock with its threshing into guitars, even domestic electropop proves that there is something new underneath the sun.
Baázs Zságer started in 5isoteles and he also played in Yonderboi's band, until eventually - perhaps because two duds didn't fit into one cup - went on his own route.
With his project (Zagar) and music that combines jazz elements, electronic dance styles and pops, he began to penetrate until he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Film by Ference Töröka "Szezon".
His formations, playing in smaller clubs, met the wider audience after the 2002 Wan2 magazine included their first album among the 50 most important domestic plates and declared Zagar in Yonderboie for almost the only domestic development that could be sold even in the West.
Zagar and his band are doubtless "in the course", although, of course, none of them have asked if they are satisfied with this sticker.
The band responded, as it belongs: she made a new, better album.
Now released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths, although the name itself tries to create a link with the initial flights in Psikostela.
This is one verse from the composition of the old band Barázs Zságer.
A reference to the ethereal, flying would be in place, but next to the ethereal breath of this music now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, trend in time - louder guitar, influence rock and roll.
In these songs the album premiered at Millenaris Park presented the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, playing recently from morning to evening popular music, we began to get caught up with a smolded tune of Wings of Love, recorded with six home singers ("Underround Divas").
So everything's okay (?).
Hvg.hu portal said Baázs Zsager.
hvg.hu: In relation to this new hit, the question is offered, how much does what you play remain, marginal music?
Baázs Zságer: The definition of marginal music means nothing to me.
I think there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternatives and pops, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, undergrad music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it can only arise because of selling, which makes it commercial.
But even a good pop song can come from sincere internal needs.
In this spirit, there is also a position as accepted, regardless of language and state borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience towards your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, there is a greater tradition of music.
There aren't only teenagers and 20 people at concerts, but also older ones.
They see a lot more of the changes in light music that are going on around them, because they also consider it to be part of a contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where, and how much does your music listen to?
B. Zs.: Of course it feels good that there are more and more people at our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music isn't our target, it's for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen more at concerts where the influence of one another is already working, but it is only hidden in the inconsistencies of the moment.
Still, I noticed that if you want to suit the audience, you're no longer interested.
Hvg.hu: How far do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He works solo and built his career from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We are not actually going his way, regardless of the fact that our music is sometimes trying to explain itself.
We are more of a team player who rely on a musical presence of another and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was not possible to avoid that our works did not compare themselves to Yonderboie's compositions, for a few of us separated from his band and went a different way.
hvg.hu: In the toplist station mr2 Petőfi the song Wings of Love got to the first place.
Many have heard Zagar's name for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, did you consciously open yourself to wider layers?
B.Zs.: We did not plan to write a hit which we would sell the board.
It's more than that song.
We thought of it as the album finale, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose those six singers?
Why is it - what was the principle?
B.Z.: The idea was to create such a gospel of the congregation.
Then came the idea of putting together this choir from a soloist at home's music scene with a good voice.
So he brought together this six-member congregation - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzor, Judy Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hoosi [Neo], Juci Németh - who then turned into Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: That's exactly how you intended a song, or did the girls translate something on it?
B.Zs.: The composition had long existed in the instrumental version, when the material came together on the board, we thought there would be something else to do with this composition.
Sled the accordions to join him in a singing party.
That night, I sang a tune on him, which girls later learned.
It all worked out for the first and most spontaneous time.
I remember how it came back to life, but, of course, there was a need for diva.
With my voice, it wouldn't work so vigorously.
hvg.hu: Both on the board and at the concert seemed to be the girls in the background.
They don't have solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing together and they're not louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They also stood at the stage in the back.
Is that intentional?
B.Z.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to share solo roles is intentional.
Even the song is to forget about our ego, where it is, where it belongs, and just to let these wings rise.
I wanted this euphoria situation that we felt when that song was born, we felt the rest.
Hvg.hu: What was the most worked out with?
B.Zs.: During the composition of music, not even with one, the harder pieces occurred more during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work the groove for a long time, then he found everything nicely in his place as in some puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song of the new board is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That keeps changing while I've already released the board.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Bad broker risked billions of worthless.
It's a professional defraudant.
Thus marks his fearless employee Jerome Kerviel the French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the domestic Commercial Bank.
She lost nearly five billion euros because of him.
However, Kerviel seems to be just a big player who wanted to deal with his colleagues and, moreover, certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all major banking houses, the crisis in the US mortgage market is early.
"He is mentally weaker," said his superiors, who sent the police to him.
However, as shown by Kerviel's statement brought by the French media, such as Le Monde's daily, was a person who had profits of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year's trades.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in confession.
In summer, he managed to make half a billion euros on the US crisis.
The opportunity was felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that the so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low income clients or to those who had trouble paying back in the past, would be in trouble.
This crisis had no impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet it right.
At the end of the year, his profit reached up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I earned the first half milliard, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits and adds that he certainly didn't leave anything for himself.
She admits throughout the interrogation that he faked the records so he wouldn't find out.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even though he began to look after his business, into the Eurex storm.
Risk was profit
He was afraid he'd come to him?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank will satisfy them."
Where did he come from the will to take so much risk?
He had to work on his position gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became a separate broker with an annual salary of $900,000.
Yet he knew he would never make as much money as the others.
"At my first interview in 2005, I knew they'd look at me.
Because of my education and also my professional and personal development," Kerviel described the investigators.
But shortly after the start, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's stock he earned, at a bomb attack on London, he was betting on a decline in this title of half a billion euros.
And that was the trigger mechanism he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll let you go.
"It's like a snowball," he told the cops.
But the bosses said they knew about everything, or they suspected.
"As long as I made money, they put their eyes on."
But then came the wound at the beginning of this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
He tried to cover up after the weekend in half of January.
When he came to work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that she lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find out about him?
The suspect became because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days for the past year.
The painter who does not have a vacation is a broker who does not want anyone to look into his records," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government yesterday signed with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes, from which the Czech Republic can obtain €14 billion in the coming years (around CZK 365 billion).
It is about half of the total amount which the Czech Republic from Brussels can obtain from 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns will go from seven operating programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will be heading for transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds which the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Business and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to acquire resources for innovative business.
Companies should obtain finance for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for introducing more efficient organisational methods.
The current use of EU funds is one of the most successful new countries within the Czech Republic.
The twelfth sentence for ex-president Nikaragui has been confirmed by the court
The appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday a 20-year sentence for the former President Arnold Aliman, to which it was sentenced in 2003, for financial fraud of $100 million (over $1.8 billion crowns).
Later on, however, he was released from prison and lived in a household prison near the steragujian metropolis.
If the head of this Central American State from 1997 to 2002 returns to prison, it is not clear according to the AP agency at this moment.
According to the President of the appeal court, Ileana Pérez will now depend on the prison officials whether they will let Yemen serve his punishment at home, or he will go to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated that he regularly shifted government money into a foreign enterprise account in Panama.
These companies were fiscal and accounts, in fact, belonged to his relatives and his nearest followers.
Some of this money then ended up in the fund that Alman founded on financing his election campaign in 2001.
That's how they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget to be drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
He went through this year with the support of the ČSSD, because the Minister Sobotka prepared him and the ČSSD could not afford to accept him.
Unlike the busy debate before the vote on the government's distrust, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies traditionally overlooked, although the most influential, the law has calmly approved.
It's a certain paradox.
Every rule begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether or not they like it or not.
The budget is a substantial part of the policy, but it is hidden behind the powerful rivalry of the opposition government.
This is media more grateful, and so much more attention is paid to him in the media.
Proud politicians are much more interesting to the public than sharp numbers.
The state budgets in past social democratic governments suffered three misdemeanors that the one in 2008 is unable to resolve at once:
The first is a high share of the law of mandatory, so-called mandated expenditure, which is not only pensions but also social benefits, which last year had been approved by the silent "coalice" of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit management as a result of failure of the first.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the definition of urban budgets and municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the definition of the state budget.
He's public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is the definition of city budgets and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to taxes, fees and loans from the bank, have obtained additional resources for investment, often to issue inadvertently bonds that they unduly owe their city halls.
In recent years, they have succeeded in paying these debts through mass sales by shares in energy and other distribution networks which have been received from the state from privatisation.
Now they don't have this source anymore.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through for several years, just like the rest of the world, the growth phase, which is constantly boasting the ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the state was increasingly in debt.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more wisely than our republics.
It's a huge disgrace, which falls primarily on the last government.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, at least at risk of poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been absolutely unnecessary in recent years.
Even though part of the pointless populist expenditure, approved before the elections this year, has failed to move the border to retirement and pension reform in the near future, then indeed, any policy in this country will end and whoever rules this way will be mere office.
With little surplus, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the extortion of normal expenditure by mandaters.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments had not been able to provide for the past 10 years.
If we do not want to really happen to the fact that the ruling politicians are going to become guardians, then we must be patient and give this unpreparably strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can get on taxes and charges, peace to prepare other reform laws.
Only this will allow a gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided together to combat the financial market crisis.
In monetary markets, this will amount to over 100 billion dollars through auctions.
In these auctions, the bank is auctioning interest rates that are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send another $40 billion into the auction, making another $42 available to the European and Swiss central bank.
This is the first time after the attacks of 11 September, as national central banks have agreed on this coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is intended to address the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow," wrote Bernard Baus in his client report from the Economic Outlook Group consultancy company.
"Coordinated actions of central banks have reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," he said.
The banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect another billion losses.
"The central banks must be really afraid of what else may follow when they decided for this procedure," said the chief economist ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with possible impact on the global economic growth.
The central banks thus decided not to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to lend money to the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about mutual lending, even though US central banks, Canada and Britain decreased their interest rates several times in autumn.
"It will have the same effect as the next decline in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the step of central banks will contribute to the ironing of the crisis because they do not solve the underlying problem, and that is the fall in the US market for real estate.
Klaus: The environmental debate is incredible
Global climate change has the most to do with developing countries.
President Klaus commented again on the issue of global warming.
The crisis has now come to an end of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he said that environmental debate is incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference, which forms a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between rhetoric that accompanys it and reality.
"Debata there is completely unstructured, it is only a fireworks of words that are substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed in presenting his book that her theme is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction in the fact that the book appears in German translation, because, as he said, "I only encounter many with caricatures of my opinions."
So now they can read its unrestricted attitudes.
Klaus reminded us that although he is not a climateist, he believes he has enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to follow and assess professional treatise, has experience with statistics, and is also a nation-owned person.
The main conclusions of the book mean that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal that there is no concise view of all scientists that the consequences of these changes are not too large and serious and therefore do not pose a threat and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
Moreover, as a person with an experience of totality, he considers it unacceptable to impose unprovoked opinions on others, which feels like a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He explained repeatedly that it is not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against military environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefit".
Klaus spoke about the same topic in Vienna two months ago in Hayek's institute.
Driver has failed to replace 600 thousand people
Six hundred thousand drivers have missed the deadline and have not been able to replace an old driving licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can ask for exchange to be able to issue a new ID by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, hundreds of drivers would go on the road without a valid licence.
According to the authorities, the IDs did not change especially those who did not want to drive anymore.
While the municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of the driver, the authorities in the metropolitan area are applied for and the interest in the exchange of the licence increased this week.
Magistrate takes about 2,000 clients a day.
There's about half an hour waiting in the fronts.
In Prague, the driver's license hasn't changed about 140,000 drivers yet.
The issue of a new licence takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for the issue within a reduced period of five days.
In such a case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who will not be able to exchange a licence until the end of the year and will be on the road without a valid driver will be at risk of fine from January.
The Province will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But police officers can deal with the deal.
In the case of an administrative breach, the fine shall be sent to CZK 2500.
According to earlier information, he could have received a fine from the town hall and the person who wasn't going anywhere.
He reportedly could have paid 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had previously called on the authorities to be mild and to impose a maximum of 1000-currency fines.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karl Hanzelka, ten thousand fines are not at risk.
The driver's license, according to him, is a document that people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not a identity card that any person must have.
People who do not want to drive anymore should surrender their driving licence.
All you need to do is take it or send it by mail to the competent municipal office as soon as possible.
At the end of the year, they will cease to pay cards issued between 1964 and 1993.
But motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three years to exchange.
The validity of the certificates issued from 2001 to 2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more documents.
The court has reduced punishments to detectives associated with Berdych.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of a criminal conspiracy with the gang of David Berdych, will go to 13 and 10 years in prison.
With definitive effect, the Prague Supreme Court, which thus reduced their penalties, decided to give them one year and two years to the other.
Originally, it threatened detectives from the Prague Department for the fight against organized crime for 14 and 12 years.
Against today's decision can no longer be appealed, it is only possible to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also accused in this case, but waits for the first instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already received penalties in the sum of over 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the National Court recognised, in particular, the involvement of 19 people in robbery, the Supreme Court today addressed the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have rejected the fact that it was a built case since the start of the investigation.
According to the Central Chamber, police members, after agreement, inter alia, with Berdych, provided police intelligence to criminals, covered individual robbery and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
Gang paid 30 percent for Opava and Cognac for it.
The prosecution concerns the crime of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, the robbery victims often suffered serious injury to health, but also to abuse the powers of public officials and illicit arms.
In search of home search, the police discovered illegally drained pistols, fires with steel core, laser tracking device, or self-smoker.
Gang was accused of stealing tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly twenty men in this process, the courts have already recognised the guilty of other Berdych robbery and many other people.
Other men from the area of Berdych are still in agreement in another trial, some bails have not yet been sent to the court.
The main presentation so far avoided Tomáš Půtov and Maroš Šulej, who remain in Irish custody, where they await definitive decisions regarding their release for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Account for Children's Exchange: 12 million
He wants a lawyer of damaged families from Igor Veleb's hospital for 12 million crowns, plus court calls.
For each mother after three million, two million dollars for father and a million for children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for every parent.
Ondrej Hospital's attorney has therefore been opposed to the Veleby proposal in principle.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," he said after the negotiations today.
"But in order to give us an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that a counterparty has made.
Let's see if it's worth anything.
But we continue in the opinion that it will be in hundreds of thousands for all," he emphasized.
The amount should be between CZK 100,000 and CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At first, the cauzy family from Jabloň wanted each month, when she didn't raise her biological daughter, a million crowns.
He served Veleb as a basis for the negotiation of a compensation expert opinion, which was developed for him by the Faculty of Hospital in Prague-Motole.
Parents, according to psychologists, suffered psychological harm and stress in various stages and depths.
The stress situation was better borne by men, even though they were concerned with the regret that the confusion of the newborns did not prevent.
Women are more than likely to deal with an up-to-date trauma, and with what's happening right now, he's summed up Veleb's contents.
Veronica and Nikola turned nurses into a turbulent hospital on December 9th.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermák in Przybyslavic and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslav Trojan to Jablonec.
Heytman Vysočina Miloš delivered to each of the families at the end of October 100.000 crowns for the replacement of expenses resulting from the error of the Štěbíčské hospital which the region will set up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured for damages from the law.
In case of doubt, they must reach the reserve fund, exceptionally they may request assistance from the organizers.
So far, the courts have granted people relatively low compensation, the sums have been counted according to the tables in the hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
The soup lost the kingdom of Valaš.
Bolek Polívka lost a dispute about the mark of the Valaš kingdom.
Although, according to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, the valasian king used the designation for the first time, the project was built by a team around Tomáš Harabis, who cooperated with the actor for a long time.
The soup didn't take part today.
According to his lawyer, the cauza probably doesn't end, and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr Harabiš and his team are paralysing in the popularity of Bolka Polívka," said the Polish lawyer.
According to him, everyone in the words of the Valashian kingdom remembers an actor and a comedian.
Harabis has the same opinion.
"It's almost a decade's worth of work.
Getting money and making up events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of a dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could have some of it.
They want to parasite on our job," he added.
Lucrating business
According to the court's designation, the Welsh king used soup for the first time on his TV show.
In 1993 he crowned him actor Radoslav Brzebotý.
But that was not the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš lost the idea of issuing Welsh passports.
The original recessionist event turned out to be a trade and Luxembourg business activity, which Harabiš then established the Valaš Kingdom.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to mention his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting their farms and theatre performances.
Who's gonna spend it on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš only used the bare idea that Polivka published in mannei for his business purpose.
"The popularity of Boleslav The soups of the Valasian Kingdom project certainly helped," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabis and his team, who was intensively dedicated to him.
The cooperation of today's disloyal parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized official coronation in Vsetín for Políček.
Since then, however, there has been a gathering between Polivka and Harabisz of disputes that culminated in the establishment of the "king of Boleslav I".
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken on the popud of Harabishe by the singer Jarmila Šulák as the queen of the mother.
In 2002 Polívka filed a complaint in Harabis and his company rejected the court today.
Clearly, Harabishus could bring about the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal the details and dates yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be like riding kings in Slovakia.
The King should be allowed for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Polívka can log in," Harabiš said.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: passing prejudices
To tell you the truth, I've never done too much Peugeot 206 before.
Its driving properties were not much, the quality of sorting, the driving and also the production could be marked only below average.
But the market is now the successor to Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
And the chambers called SW are a little further away, and I don't want to think better.
When I was testing the classic hatchback Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the head space on the rear seats.
That's the end of the complaint, because the harvest body means there won't be a two-meter long in this respect.
On the Flight of the World
I'm going through very quickly so I don't get too drunk.
It's a pretty good design, where I've got one piece to go to the poor middle tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more designer innovation here when the car is already looking so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
Side lines also significantly improved against model 206.
As far as space is concerned, there is also a sense of an increase in body dimensions.
In the chamber, then, the said lack of space is gone.
Cuffs in the trunk
So the main thing on this vehicle is his luggage.
I must evaluate this as a very well-accessible window (and also thanks to the extrusion of the back window) and well stored.
The deaf areas are equipped with restraints, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not prevent, it can be stretched, and it keeps harder objects.
But let's stop over the volume together.
It is according to the tables in the basic arrangement 428 l, which is more likely to be the average value against competition.
Not in the Czech Republic, however, the most sold car of this class - Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with a new generation of youthless product, then we find that Peugeot has a very significant 52 liters.
For vacation abroad or when loading the stroller is this value to critical.
But if I were to lift up the positives, I still have to mention the floor completely after the backrest of the second row or very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a spark-ignition four-cylinder with a volume of 1.6 l with a capacity of 88 kW.
And to be honest, that's what 16-year-olds should look like, driving a family hatchback.
She's quiet, she has little consumption, and she's drawn first and foremost.
If I compare her with a harmful oblivion that ever works as if she had a stuffed cloth in her exhaust, then all I can do is be excited about her.
The price list will tell
Car price isn't human.
However, we must keep in mind that we have tested a well equipped car with spacious interiors and a very good engine.
The basic car price with the spark-ignition 14th for 329 900 CZK still stands.
Our aggregate costs CZK 410 900, which is quite enough.
The tested equipment Premium then throws equipment for another 80,000 CZK on top.
But we had even more head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic burnouts, electrical rear window control...
Just a car costs all over CZK 531 900.
It's a lot, but you can count on the extra equipment at Fabie and you'll get a lot like this.
So there's no choice but to make a decision for the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not successful
Children from Eastern European countries come to British schools, which in local settlements raises concerns about further developments in local education.
The integration of Eastevropans has so far led to a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of indigenous peoples are increasing in violence.
The problem with integration of Eastern European children at British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where there are starting to be disputes between local residents and Slovak immigrants.
Fights, hams, and fights among pupils have also moved to relationships between parents.
The situation has gone so far, that the police have arrested a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old student with iron bars in Chatham.
The guilty is defending her by a boy insulting her with racist doses.
Police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak mover.
The girls of the man reportedly encountered racist remarks and threw stones on him.
"When we went home, some boy climbed up the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop it, he got his apples and pears on us, and then he discovered his ass," she described another unpleasant event for The Times, the mother of Slovak pupils.
Complaints are both sides of it.
One of the local settlers even identified disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for the fight for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere at British schools between local and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
In Britain, 70 thousand Slovaks are registered here for work.
A total of 30,000 Slovak students then visit British schools.
Cuba the most beautiful island of Caribbean
For visitors, he is indeed an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled if you choose correctly.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, quiet as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and tan cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf, and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find it in a fuller and richer reading.
Only on one island, but you will find even more and the island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
For Spain, Cuba used to be the bastion of America.
Columbus referred to her as the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a copy of the treasures that the Spaniards in America robbed and transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The Nacional Hotel grew up at the very end of the 20th century.
He let him build one of the U.S. bosses of Lucky Luciano, because all that was a crime in the U.S. (especially a prohibition), was welcomed and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
His guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall houses grew up, after wide boulevards drove cars, which belonged to the iconic symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a settlement in San Francisco de Paul, a short walk from Havana, and Cojima had his yacht in Cojima.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio left their signatures to the star of show business and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of Havana Bodeguita.
In a bar of expensive Nacional Hotel mix you cocktails as you wish.
And that 50-year-old cult car rides around Havana, because once imported jigs and fiatas in that salty and wet weather have already rotted.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is greatly lost, nowhere in the area is as beautiful colonial monuments as there is.
Other places are also beautiful, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much money, its development has green.
New hotels have grown in Havana for the past 15 years, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguin Province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another libest, which is unique in the world and will appreciate it especially by train owners.
Centrifuges from vast plantations brought steam and motor trains into the confines.
Their car park has not been restored for decades, and so there are only museums in the museum to see the working machine.
Where do you think you're going?
Most famous visitors to Cuba don't miss the most famous places.
And so there's no need to write about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps just reminding that the museum is already mentioned in Hemingway's residence and who likes this writer should not be allowed to miss.
The Valley of Viennas One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Vinìles Valley in the west of the island.
The vegetation is growing from the limeboard.
Mots, calcium homols, and rocks are lifted from the bottom of the valley, and in their hollows there is a fertile land, which makes them even a large scale covered with dense vegetation.
The Valley is a place where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco can grow.
With its final appearance you can meet, if you visit one of the Hawaiian factory for the production of cigars.
Well, maybe it's interesting, too, that the Chilian episode of Major Zeman was shot there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The glory and wealth brought him a slave trade and sugar.
The richness was transformed into the beauty and exhibition of a small town.
Colonial Spanish architecture, markedly influenced by later French settlers, has not changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and Escambray, is a place so remote that in the 1950s there was no road that would connect the country with the rest of the country.
She helped him stay away.
Nothing was up there, and that's why nothing went wrong, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If a person has more time at Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity of Playa Ancón beach or the Cucrovar Valley.
In the evening, it belongs to Casa de la Música, who is living after dark and the music inside her is entangled over the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the very east of Cuba is called the most beautiful on the island.
Such an opinion has affected the path itself.
Both roads that lead there from Guantánama must overcome the high and members of the mountains and pass through the nature that human activity has hardly meant.
The Eastern Uprising of Cuba has written UNESCO due to its undisturbed nature on the World Heritage List.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have Columbus's cross (in fact it came about a hundred years after Colombia's cruise) and from the hill where the castle and today's El Castillo Hotel are located, there are several table mountains, most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Maestro's Mount, the Bay of Pigs and the Isle of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the Holy Cuban patrons of Caridad del Cobre, about the santia, the African religions that recognize the descendants of the local slaves, all of this could be described by many pages.
But as they say right, you'd better see it once.
The Allies in Afghanistan are passive, U.S.A.
Few soldiers and lack of necessary equipment influence the United States’ mission course in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to defense minister Robert Gates, should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The Mission in Afghanistan is not taking place in the vision, they have agreed in the Scottish Edinburgh countries that have units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the increasing resistance of the Taliban movement today, eight countries are discussing other plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States, through Secretary of Defense this week, invited NATO to do more activity, United Kingdom sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
"The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military power can only be one part of the solution.
The next is to allow the citizens to start the next development of the economy and security themselves," said the station of the British Defense Minister Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels has been the highest in the last five years, according to American military records.
The number of violent actions rose by 27 percent last year, even 60 percent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have some 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached their limits in the organization and equipment of the units.
More helicopters, soldiers and experts are specifically asking for training Afghan troops.
"We will have to seriously think about specific targets for the next time and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke in a similar way today.
"I am not pleased with what is on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that is not enough," said Reuters De Hoop, at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
In recent months, participating countries have also disputed whether all allies have maximum results in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for passiveness.
"Germans have quite a number of representations in Afghanistan.
But they are set up in areas where the minimum of violence and their claims are not as high as we are in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British Bulgarian letter Sun this week marked German soldiers as sloths.
"Afghan scavengers revealed: The Germans play while our boys are fighting," wrote Sun in the material, accompanied by a picture of the German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went into counter-operated and printed the British unit's image in the South Afghanistan ragby match.
State debt will be spent on a trillion in 2009
For every Czech man, the debt is over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose at the end of September at CZK 842,7 billion.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to a better development in the management of the state budget.
The Czech Republic's state debt rose at the end of September at CZK 842,7 billion.
In nine months this year, 40.2 billion crowns increased.
But since June, however, 13.4 billion crowns have been reduced.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed today its data on state debt from the beginning of October.
For each Czech man, the debt is over 84.000 crowns.
For the whole year last year, the state has owed over more than 111 billion crowns.
"So far, it seems that due to the lower deficit next year, we could overcome a billion crowns in 2009.
Next year, debt should be between 900 billion crowns and trillion crowns," said Patria Finance David Marek for the server iHNed.cz analyst.
Similarly, they see the analyst Next Finance Vladimír Pikora: "In order to exceed one trillion we could get in the course of 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget we don't know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, could move on for 2010.
But I do not suppose this change," he said.
Debts grow
State debt constitutes central government debts and arises mainly by accumulation of government budget deficits.
State debt is financed by bonds, government bonds, direct loans, or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The government's internal debt has so far increased by 38.5 billion this year to CZK 719.4 billion.
The government’s foreign debt increased by 1.7 billion crowns this year to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt at the end of September reached CZK 803.3 billion and dropped CZK 13.7 billion from June.
The average maturity of state debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent year-on-year to third quarts, which is really a lot to see how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated in bonds with an increase of 20 percent.
It is bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that it will trade when the pension reform is here," Piko said.
Better than expected
The 2007 State Debt Management Strategy shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 156.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to a better development in the management of the state budget.
The amount consists mainly of the definition of the state budget, which is likely to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the expected CZK 91.3 billion.
It is also the planned maximum resources for the Czech consolidating agency CZK 13.3 billion, a 10-milliard reserve for pensions, financing state bonds for CZK 43 billion and repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to CZK 1.8 billion.
The woman is to come to the court today in Khartoum for giving her name to a bald bear.
The British teacher, tried in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to fifteen days in prison on Thursday evening, as her lawyer said.
The British was accused of leaving six to seven year old disciples to give a bald bear the name Mohammed, despite any depiction of the prophet Islam being forbidden.
She was subjected to the punishment of the whip.
This British 45 - year - old teacher, working at the University of High School of Sudan in Chartou, was arrested at home on Sundays and accused of insulting Islam and of rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed complaints with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins already in September when the teaching teacher asks six to seven year old pupils to choose the name for a class bilge bear.
"From the mouth of the children, eight names include Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," said Robert Boulos.
After a vote takes place in class, 20 out of 23 children will eventually choose Mohammed's favorite name.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very extended Christian name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a description: "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself had no label with this name, but it is in the image of the prophet considered to be an insult to Islam.
One fellow Muslim Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that she knew her well and would never do anything that might be offensive to any religious faith:"I regret only that she asked children to vote for a name," he said.
Many teachers share such an opinion, who describe it as "very thoughtful to their pupils" and say that "they never speak of religion in class".
Let us remind you that the first name of Mohamed is also the second most frequently awarded first name in Great Britain, in English it is written in 14 different ways.
This Christian name often selected by Muslim families represents a way of honoring the prophet (time is given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Is it possible, for example, to put them in a toy?
Sure, it's a matter of interpretation.
On the last round of negotiations, this centre in Vienna failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Eventually, failure.
Serbian and Kosovské Albánci ended the sixth in the Austrian Baden on Wednesday morning and the last round of interviews without overcoming different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach an agreement on status," said Wolfgang Ischinger, European negotiator during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area is "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Prištin to ensure their commitment to peace and be ready for dialogue after the end of the negotiations.
"We don't expect violence in the near future, but we enter a challenging period," he added, "it's evident that the situation is tense".
The negotiations end December 10th
The Troika negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last go to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the Albanian speaking population are formed, could be shown in a clearer light on December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and last round of negotiations since the UN, in August this year, Troika entrusted new negotiations.
The Americans and Europeans are counting on conversations to be terminated on 10 December.
On the other hand, Russians, who have previously blocked Kosovo's independence in the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
"Rusko was and remains inclined to deal with the negotiated solution, compromise solution", said Bocan-Charkchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of administration of the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence under the supervision of the EU to be the only effective solution.
The English declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is prepared to declare its independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Godzal, we have not reached any agreement," announced President Fatmir Sejdíj in the Baden Hotel, where this 'negotiation of last chance' has taken place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of Kossky Albanians and future prime minister of province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan introduced by Belgrade "is the past that led to murder and deportation".
"Dominal Effect"
On the other hand, Serbia's President Tadić considers that the compromise is still being taken into account and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of possible unilaterally declared independence of the province.
It is said that Belgrade is particularly concerned about the "dominant effect" in the region, which is still unstable as a result of the struggle for independence in the 1990s.
"That doesn't mean it to Serbia," he said, "it's impossible to compromise."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions be based exclusively on the Security Council, in which its Russian ally possesses the right of veto.
"The Cossian Parliament will have the last word"
"The only solution from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia", said Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"This meeting took two years.
It must end as it began in the Council of Security."
The reporters of Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the last word of status would have a Kosovo Parliament" and added that if there were a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speakers, "by agreement" with the West would take place.
Bush managed an agreement on Israelis and Palestinians
During the launch of the international peace conference in Annapolis in Maryland, called for by his impulse, the American President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed on the immediate opening of negotiations once and for all, to resolve 60 years of conflict between the two nations.
In the presence of both men Bush promised to do everything to help them close a "murder contract" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy the "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must put an end to colonial activities, declared Bush and recalled the responsibilities that both sides have come from "the travel maps" to the peace they have adopted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbes have the objective of "continuing a peace treaty that would solve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues".
This declaration includes three questions, which are in the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees evicted in the conflict in 1948 from their homes in the territory of the present State of Israel.
Abbes took the words of the U.S. President and stressed that the subsequent negotiations should be "total and thorough" and that he could touch all aspects of the solution, with reference to "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, safety, among others".
Then Olmert, who expressed his view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and said that it was necessary to "set up to be closed during 2008".
Bush determined the end of 2008 as a date for the implementation of his "visa of two states", Palestinian and Israeli, existing next to himself.
Saudi Arabia has declared that Bush accepted the commitment in this sense before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries which Israel offers peace in exchange for the release of all Arab territories taken during the war in 1967, including Eastern Jerusalem.
Annapolis means the crossroads in the Middle East history, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", judges Prince Saúd in an interview, which provided one Arab speaking journal with a hidden Saudi capital.
According to the D.A., police don't take responsibility.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As there is always such small news from the black chronicle, the official version does not match what people say.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the French State Police General (Inspectation Générale de la police nationale, IGPN), a police car ran through Louise-Michel Street shortly after 17 hours in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in the mode of intervention, but was on the patrol and passing through at a speed of 40 to 50 km/hour, without the side lights on", explains the police source.
Green bike of the Kawasaki brand, "Unregistered and therefore without permission to ride on public roads" (see below), controlled by two young men without helmets, drove through "very high speed".
"Motorcycle hit the left side of the police car after he didn't choose from the right," said one police officer.
The blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle crew showed negative.
The condition of the car (depleted foreclosure, crushed front glass, abandoned bumpers) indicates the severity of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givra very quickly responded and announced yesterday morning that IGPN had committed an investigation of "unintended killing and not providing assistance to people at risk", which was also taken into account by the directorship départementale de la sêreté publique du Val-d'Oise (direction of Regional Police Department Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the morning press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excluded, at this stage, the police's responsibility for the accident.
Three Witnesses of accidents who were interviewed on Sunday night, according to official notice, "a number of policemen have confirmed that the mini-motor had reached them relatively quickly from the left".
A bit of a stretch, undoubtedly caused by the clipsen of the earth yesterday, showed that both vehicles were stuck up until the police car was able to scream.
The vehicles have been secured, and they'll go through the technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed yesterday on both victims' bodies.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday, the Villiers-le-Bel spread quickly among the people by saying that the police should leave the scene quickly without providing the first aid to two young men.
IGPN had, in all care, also excluded "any serious error" at this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more exploration and with which to be very careful," said the police source.
The newspaper "Liberation" met with eyewitnesses about a few moments after the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident happened.
"By chance, my cousin and I, who are health nurses at the hospital, ran down to try to resurrect them," says this witness.
There was nothing we could do."
Then he saw "the shrinking, scared cop.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men and the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the rapidly growing tension and certain present, that the situation of young people was hopeless, police officers were taken by car by colleagues who arrived in the meantime.
According to the same witness, an ambulance arrived 20 minutes after the police left.
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"No one says that the police authorities of the youths have stepped up to help.
First aid was provided to these young people.
Firemen have arrived immediately.
Everything was done for their salvation", pointed out by the prosecutor.
The tensions in Pakistan are rising
On Monday, Pakistan police pushed the first demonstrations since the announcement of the special state of Musharraf General, two days earlier.
In Lahor, east of the country, about 2000 lawyers demonstrating the measures taken under exceptional conditions, were injured with tear gas, which, according to witnesses, used the orderly force.
The last appointment was answered by the stones, which hurt several policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios like Karáčí and Rawalpindi where police officers attacked and hurt lawyers.
A few should have been summoned.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court called after a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of the waves of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The access streets to the Supreme Court were replaced by roadblocks on Monday morning in order to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations were intended to take place in Multan and Peshawar.
On Monday, the movement of lawyers gained the support of religious parties grouped in a politically strong alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "received the population to send flowers to judges who stood up against the exceptional state, and the garbage of those who had sworn an oath to Musharraf".
"Mushararaf's promise doesn't pay."
Pakistan's Supreme Court is a direct target of a special measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to express his legal re-electation of President Musharfa in the indirect presidential election that took place on October 6th.
The President of Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
"All we have witnessed is illegal, unlawful, and against the judgments of the Supreme Court," declared the official in The News.
The promise of Parvíz Musarfa to give up military leadership and become a civilian president, "is not paying" after the introduction of an exceptional state, said Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform to 15 November when he finished his first presidential mandate.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also turned aside in a country of perpetual speculation, according to which the representative of the army had ordered President Musharraf to go home to prison.
More than a third of pregnancy still constitute an unexpected pregnancy
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %) as well as poorly planned or unexpected.
More than one pregnancy of three (36 %) is currently unexpected, reveals a study conducted by the French Institute national d'émographyiques (Ined)- The State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuvirth Act, which in France terminated birth control.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %) as well as poorly planned or unexpected.
Different methods of birth control, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilisation, still show 5% to 6% of the rate of failure, are estimated by Ined.
The administration of birth control only allowed better "fruit control", says the Institute and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptives in women between 20 and 44 has reached 60% today from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight births of ten are well planned today.
One of the five has even childbirth calculated per month precisely and, if possible, in spring, which is considered the most enjoyable annual period for the birth of the child.
A remarkable repair of the space station
More than seven hours of work in space needed an astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to a remarkable repair of the affected solar panel necessary for the further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky exit to the universe, which collected records of lengths, distances from residential modules, the speed with which was planned and the degree of "cutility" that astronauts spent on repair.
Troubles appeared on Tuesday, while the astronauts from the Discovery ship removed the Harmony module, a large rolling unit designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see box).
This module is some kind of landing mole for modules-laborator.
However, it is necessary to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move the 17th century module producing electricity by means of solar panels, which was already on the ISS, so as to anchor at its final post.
After repositioning it, the crew began to decompose seventy-metre solar panels of the module.
And in that was one of the panels, disintegrating as a puller, as a result of the bolting of the cable, damaged on the surface by almost one meter.
Decomposition has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauti, who were originally to perform a control output to the Discovery ship, and then go to correct another solar panel, whose system of rotation had a malfunction, were forced to deal with the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to the end of the robot arm of the ship, attached to the station's shoulder, and made repairs.
He's one of the best "Sancewalkers" (mature walkers) of the American Aviation and Space Office (NASA).
Tall, brave, very skillful, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
In his 46 years, this original profession was entrusted with the physician to "operated" the solar panel.
After a detailed examination of the damage, he cut off the fault cable and fixed it to the damaged places of some kind of "holy".
He was helped by the second "spacewalker", which remained near the compensation chamber, as well as from the inside, other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, namely, a mini-hike taped insulating device, to prevent an electroshoke on solar panels producing several hundred volts, invented and "after the cup" made astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully decomposed and then infiltrated its tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before the day when seven astronauts would return to Discovery to return on Wednesday, as planned, to Earth.
EADS shares weaken
The EADS shares will significantly lose at the Paris Stock Exchange after this company operating in the aviation and defence industry has announced that it will have to spend €1.2 to €1.4 billion in order to face the delay of the A400M aircraft.
EADS has lost 4% and is now at a Paris Stock Exchange of 21.96 euros.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its expected production results for 2007 as a result of the delays resulting from the slow progress towards the development of an aircraft engine A400M, which is the condition of the starting flight.
The price for reducing the delay in the supply of a military freighter, declared in October, was estimated at "EUR 1,2 to 1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus", announced the parent undertaking of the European EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS, next Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results, will be forced to announce a new outlook for profit before deduction of interest and taxes (EBIT).
The group also stated that the new estimate of costs corresponded with a six-month delay.
Please note that the production results of the EADS in 2006 fell by 86 % in particular due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely A380’s giant aircraft.
Originally, the group assumed that the first delivery of the aircraft A400M to the French army would be available in October 2009.
Decision on the status quo
Sunday's elections will take place without a sudden expectation: the Russians will choose the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming that, after the end of a very few free electoral campaign, its drive to stability, and to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, the Russian President Vladimir Putin will communicate to voters at public service stations the broadcast television message, however, the contents of which are kept secret.
He does so from the position of the leader of the United Russia, the Procremel Party, which seems to celebrate the fierce victory.
When foreign states ambassador accepted yesterday, the president did not let anything come out of him and settled with another attack on the West accused of interference - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we wish the most transparent and most open election, the election without the slightest lack of beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it's not even close.
They condemn the campaign with various pressures.
The Communist leader Gennadij Zjuganov says that "there has never been such a dirty election, not even for Jeltina."
After the repression of protests last weekend, former master of the world in Garry Kasparov chess, sentenced for five days to prison for an illegal demonstration, he continues to prohibit visit according to his lawyer.
"Russ remained the mentality of homo sovietica"
In the background of these parliamentary elections, simple expectations are posed by two far more open questions:
- "Who will become Putin's successor to the presidential office?
Date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; the public candidates may present themselves by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in a row.
However, no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful party of the United Russia who chooses government and president?
One way or another, the ruling power will win all the way to parliamentary elections, as well as the presidential elections.
It's tradition.
"Rusom remained the mentality of homo sovietica, does not feel to be the lord of his fate", says Sociologist Lev Gudkov, Director of the Independent Centre Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University in Sankt-Peštěburg notices the time-to-range link: civil society has taken, in this country baptized five centuries after Europe, delays; the famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has made a national paternalist model, perfectly accepted by the population, but rather that this new paternalism did not carry a terror, but a certain economic well-being", says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians are now "liberately giving personal responsibility" which has been demonstrated shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon concerns all social layers, including the trading world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (from the total number of 85 Heads of Russia) manages local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, like in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Tamara Cednichenko, 44-year-old professor: "What do you think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded Memory
After more than 60 years in a confidential regime, Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, open to the public.
47 million archive documents stored at 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were only accessible for 'humanitarian' purposes, that is to say individually and namely, on request of the former victim or its authorised persons.
Eleven states entrusted with archive management - between Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States is over, the opening of the agreement came to effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
Free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to explore "especially the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and forced health", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states have, among them, opposed to making these nominal documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What homosexuality or mental disability of some victims are expected.
The registers of concentration camps or warrants created by the Gestapo were collected after the war for a practical purpose of finding deported or forced work submitted by civilians, bringing them evidence of their internalization in order to open the way indemnification.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are engaged in tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only limited benefits.
"From these documents, nothing in principle new can be expected", said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Study Centre, Technosche Universität in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach free trade agreements in 2008
Today, the bilateral trade between Europe and India has reached nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expected in 2008 to sign the Free Trade Agreement, report to the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, EU Ministers gave the Green European Commission a green light to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Associations of South-East Asia (Asean). The bilateral trade between Europe and India has now reached nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, a 9th trading partner of the EU.
"The Free Trade Agreement greatly adopts both economies" and "India will gain better access to the 450 million prosperous Europeans market", added Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products of exported India, has clarified the European Commissioner for Asia and the European giant together will change "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services", said Danièle Smadja, Head of European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that the bilateral trade "is not yet reached its full potential". The EU and India meet on Friday at the 8th joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barros.

The UK bank took note of concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
On Thursday, the UK bank indicated that it intended to alleviate current concerns about the deterioration of the conditions on the credit market and to announce the offer of £10 billion in a five-week auction for a basic interest rate of 5.75%, the offer in force for an unusually long time.
"In order to ease the concerns that the financial market conditions will end up in a very negative situation for banks in a way that will ensure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserves during the maintenance period, which will start on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation", reported in the communication.
The Bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the financial market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT until 10 January at the basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first time that BOE pumps cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They normally last a week.
In its communication, BOE adds that "is ready to implement further measures to maintain the interest rate on an interbank basis on an interbank basis with its basic rate.
The interday interbank interest rate was 5,829 % on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate was settled at 6,6 %, which is the highest number since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sumes have been placed on the financial market by the English bank associated with the fee rates which have been discouraged by the Bank since the application of this offer.
According to certain speculations, the evolution of the pound exchange rate towards the euro, many preferred to choose the sum placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more reliable discretion.
UMP (Union pour un movement populaire, Union for People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to deal with proposals of Socialists (PS) on purchasing capacity
The UMP and Nouveau Centre Clubs refused to discuss each of the paragraphs of the Socialist Act on Buyability on Thursday, which is equal to the rejection of the text.
On the agenda, the text of the draft law came within the framework of the so-called socialist "gift" (the meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary club) and contained ten measures taken on Tuesday by the PS Presidency, among which the increase in employment premium was 50 %, the renewal of fluctuating TIP, transport check or the regulation of rent.
Given that the UMP and NC voted against the negotiations of individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was concluded after a general debate which became an opportunity for an opinion exchange, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before the TV performance of Nicolas Sarkozy on the purchase.
The Head of Members of PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club would resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of additions to an amendment to the Finance Act, which will be discussed by the House next week.
New Festival is born
As a result of many speculations about C3 Presents in Philadelphia creating a new festival, he announced this promoter/producer of Vineland Festival in New Jersey in cooperation with the Festival of the Republic of British organizer Melvin Benn.
"For our company it is an honor to work with a man who without any intervention inspired the current festival movement in America", declared Charlie Jones from C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 manufactures the Chicago Festival Lollapaloosis and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is the summer destination of campers.
The festival should take place from 8 to 10 August at a private farm with 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known under the name of Mean Faddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989 he took part in the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his portfolio Leeds Festival, then the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk in 2006.
From 2002 onwards Melvin Benn has, as co-owner, also in charge of production, licence and organizational tasks at Glastonbury Festival, which has today capacity of 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 refers to Glastonbury as the most inspired event, which he has ever experienced and says that his company and Melvin Benna are working simultaneously to give the region a European style festival event.
"Originally we chose Philadelphia as a market and together with Fairmount Parks Commission we worked hard to start a festival in the centre of Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
"I sat with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, due to current city leadership, Charlie Jones adds politics.
"Happyly, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we're about to start a great festival in an exceptional place to serve the Philly residents."
C3 Presents in 2005 won the Lollapaloosis Festival in Chicago Grant Park, after they emerged at the festival stage of Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to 9,8M and 11,3M dollars.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
"Melvin Benna's European model takes place in the countryside, while our festivals are taking place more on green stands in cities", says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a certain way so that we can create both the impression of the rural festival after the European and urban after the American."
Vineland is located halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Obec Vineland, including the mayor, strongly supports the execution of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The last appointed person refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says that "they are sufficiently beneficial to allow investment in such an event and to welcome a festival that will have, hopefully, a long duration".
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will take over 80,000 people.
He says that the groups have already been sent invitations, but nothing can yet be confirmed at the moment when the program is only published.
"Vineland will have a rock breath, but music will be varied to attract a wide spectrum of viewers as far as possible," says Carlie Jones.
The C3 partners who received the Top Independent Promotor Award in the last year of Billboard Touring Awards are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to get Hollywood movie studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself builds up against it...
This persuasion mission is one of the delegation's tasks.
However, his mandate is "politically demanding" because Governor California Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to fall "Guvernator" into claws?
"It must be careful, it's industry, who decides where he's going.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer them the best", he said.
Festival Honba
However, it is the priority of Denise Turcottea to promote the local film.
The race for the Oscars has already begun.
At all festivals of the West Coast, whether it's festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's about presenting québecký films, alerting them and ensuring that the directors provide interviews.
The age of darkness had a good publicity at Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
In January, he will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th year Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Québec also introduced four short-term and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
The end of the year at the maraton stock exchange? Experts split the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year and investors already expect me to reach the traditional marathon at the end of the year.
But this year, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Bank Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December is taking a positive course on the stock exchange".
However, it is not possible to create predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in current context, markets offer, at least in the short term, certain doubts".
These experts do not assume that the stock exchange in recent weeks is going to fall apart, and they say that "the impact market holds liquidity existence that is ready to invest because of the lack of alternatives to guarantees, especially the firm income affected by turnover effects to quality valuable papers, both in long and short positions".
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have rather a calm course, not without volatility, " firstly because it is not known that the impact of the FED tariff fall (Federal Reserve System) is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of incentives for inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, head of BPI bank sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time for a bold statement that there will be a marathon.
"There's not too much reason to be happy," he assures this expert.
Ibex lost nearly 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed to 15,945,7 points.
Yet, all experts do not have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst of Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end up a year closer to 16 000 points thanks to regrouping portfolios and traditional pension deposits that occur every year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that everything will be a little different this year, because he believes that the marathon will happen earlier, during the second December week following an extended weekend on the occasion of the Constitutional Day.
The analyst mentioned does not consider that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, analytics of Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching the technical level, and "for this reason we could observe the index reflection, made by U.S. reports on the consequences of the credit market crisis".
Analysts believe these consequences will be positive.
Analysts match the selection of titles that will make sure they bring Ibex to the new maximum.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that "letos is lined with strong titles."
This expert would include both major banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
On the other hand, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco ensures that the increases are in hand with banking and industry.
The construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves on this marathon if it happens.
"ACS has been reinstated for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way", explains the expert.
Cycle consumption will be forward in the last part of the year thanks to an increase in sales during Christmas sales.
On the other hand, this expert believes that technology will be doing very well, even though there are no too many representations in the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years
Over the last seven years, December has only been a month of downfall in two cases.
The actual marathon took place at the end of 2003 in the administrative year when stock markets ended with a crisis caused by a collapse of technological bubbles.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
We'll see if 2007 will be in the fifth profit year (and then Ibex has increased by 8.36%) since January and whether he will manage to have his marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular bank decided to modernise most of its branches.
Total of two hundred located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Mapular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Similarly, for other Spanish entities, since it is the first group to decide to jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches up to 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group that has also found out several times that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to cancel the opening period of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for extending the opening time by one afternoon, even if not for the public.
The results of this experience will be crucial for other entities to join or not to join this initiative which supports opening hours of trade.
That's exactly what Popular bank's purpose is for the project.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their shopping, smaller and medium-sized companies, tradeists and shops from selected streets where there will be opening branches.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, because it is not about opening new branches, but only about the modification of existing ones.
For this reason, the bank modernises branches that it already has in business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
The extension of the opening time is supplemented by another concept of branch space and new, more updated design in brighter colours.
The business manager of Ángel Rivera assures that this restructuring will not constitute a major investment but a larger recruitment of staff as it goes from six employees to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with rooms for meetings of small and medium-sized enterprises and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Popular bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Branches were selected in the Madrid streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía and according to Rivera it seems like a happy choice.
Popular bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 specialized for immigrants that are operated under the Mundocredit brand also has a very long opening time and even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax will not follow the BBVA model, where many of its branches offer to sell a large range of non-financial products.
'We don't want to compete with our clients', reports Rivera.
They just made a deal with Telefónica for the sale of phones through external personnel.
Telecinco for the first time in the stock market doubled the value of her rival Antenny 3
We did it.
He expressed this sentence yesterday by Paolo Vasile, the Executive President of Telecinco, his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade, when he stated that the TV he was driving doubled the value of his rival Antens 3.
Only one thing brought about his joy: 'what I'm sorry is that it didn't happen because we would increase more, but because we fell less', he said.
Yet, he stressed that, thanks to the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended trading by 2.54% yesterday.
This profit shifted their loss over the last part of the year to 15.66 %.
According to Bloomberg, the stock value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with a total of 52 % capital) is estimated at EUR 4 488.88 million.
Antena 3, which dropped by 1,52 % yesterday and decreased by 40.5 % overall since January, has a half-value of 2 193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that have been evaluated is 3.571 billion for Sogecable, 2 518.53 million Prisa (expert Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparisons with Antona 3 are offered, because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market at what price and how we assess it in the ratings."
Telecinco last week announced that this year, by overcoming billions of gross advertising revenue from advertising will become the first television channel, as Giuseppe Tringali guaranteed, CEO of Telecinco and Publicespaña, a branch that provides advertising to the group.
If the expected data were indeed achieved, this TV channel would have seen a growth of 3.6% this year compared to 966.4 million in 2006.
At the same time in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1,6 % (and thus reached 734,4 million), while the net revenues of this TV increased by 0.7 % (630,4 million).
One of the factors that analysts focus on, for Telecinco's best relative development on the stock exchange is increased pay out, which has been preserved so far: in 2006, this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, between its shareholders 100 % of its profits.
Vasile ensures that although it is early to make decisions, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33 % of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, which we have already increased 33% Endemol'.
According to the analysts, the market shows some fatigue in these moments.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced his estimates of Telecinco’s profit in 2008 4 % and 7 % in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected increase in revenue from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company decreased the projected profit of Anteny 3, i.e. 4.5 % in 2008 and 7.5 % in 2009.

Congress approved the transposition of MiFID valid from 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations which were terminated today by the vote of the Congress on novels incorporated by the Senate in the draft law, the government has subjected the regulation to a public hearing which is developing a new law, with a view to both entering into force before the end of the year.
The leaders of each party have consistently raised the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of entities needed for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Act on securities trading, foresees modernization of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial advice to be provided to both specialised companies and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial service providers (ESIS), financial advice companies (AFIs), which are linked to securities companies, securities intermediaries and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for carrying out operations with financial instruments is expanded to include multilateral trading systems and internalisation systems that will compete with current stock exchange agents.
Furthermore, the law obliges investment firms to disseminate information on the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and risk mitigation methods and requires the reporting of all transactions performed for the simplification of supervision by CNMV.
In the course of the negotiations at the Congress Commercial Commission, several adjustments were included, among which the securitised claims are considered to be a "comprehensible" financial instrument due to the high danger of an investor who was demonstrated by what happened in the USA with high risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive has been used to legally define functions that can be held by bacteria in the field of economics and the management of the company for 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which sets out the professional functions reserved for the economists.
At the same time, the Senate has set up new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work on an external basis, will not require an authorisation from the CNMV and will be able to provide product trading services and acquire clients for various investment firms at the same time.
In November, the Harmonised ISC increased by five decimals to 4.1 %
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during November.
Its publication corresponds to Eurostat and Central European Bank (CEB) policy to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INI (National Statistics Institute) recalled that the information provided by this provisional indicator was indicative only and therefore did not necessarily match the final data that would enter into the knowledge of 14 December this year.
"ISC will continue to remain on a relatively high level"
Second Prime Minister and Minister Pedro Solbes said that the November ISC increase at 4.1% was "a temporary number", but also foretold that the price index would continue at a relatively high level in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in the spheres of Congress stated that "even if it is not a favourable number", the Spanish inflation differential towards the monetary union is still "more or less" the same in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the last month when the government did not count on such a high increase.
"We were expecting a value of around 4%", said the Minister of Economy to the data submitted today.
Virginia is planning to make a €42 billion Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock got into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from Bank of England, its deposits fell by more than 50 % to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
At that time, the Bank managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually did not trust clients during two and a half months even though the government offered a hundred percent guarantee for this money and would extend it to the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who replaces his Virginia Money financial brand, needs to obtain around a quarter of the revenue put into British banks in the next three years, to gain the remaining 18 billion and thus reach the goal of 30 billion.
The magnate group of Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom with his significant advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million (about €70 million) per year for advertising and marketing in order to reach its purpose.
This week, the Northern Rock Bank has marked the offer of a consorate of Virginia, which makes up three more companies, as they prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totana arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
Today, the Civil Guard in the early morning held the current mayor of the town of Totana (People's Party) because of its alleged involvement in corruption practices in the construction revealed this week.
Also, one of the mayor's secretary's officers and chief of the local police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced in May this year Juan Morales, the present People's Member, and until then the mayor of the municipality, who, according to the sources of investigation addressed by the Caden SER, could have been the head of the entire business.
Police continue to monitor the building of the City Hall and the Construction Commission and no further arrests are excluded in the following hours.
In addition, he was charged with a lawyer named Juan Morales, the chief suspect in corruption practices during the construction that was revealed at the beginning of this week.
As Caden SER informed yesterday, a lawyer from the People's Republic of Juan Morales, who was examined, arrested in leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
Moreover, according to the investigation sources, Morales' alleged acquisition of commissions is the subject of an agreement on the construction of the Galician construction company, which has been exceeded by 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted the offer to the head of the Japanese PSOE candidate and, if they win, chair the Congress
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the proposal of the Prime Minister and Secretary-General of the Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapatera to stand in the next general elections, headed by the PSOE candidate list (Spain’s Social Party) in Toled, and in the event that the Socialists win the general elections, he became Chairman of Congress.
At the press conference, the PSOE Secretary for José Blanco himself announced this meeting with Zapater, which took place today at noon in the federal headquarters of the party.
Head of the executive offer to the former minister because in political life it's important to count on the best of them and Bono's among the best.
He also noted that 'yes, seems' that this politician from La Manchy will be the candidate of the Socialist Party to the Presidency of Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as Chairman of Congress, who published his decision on 15 November not to candidate in the next general elections and leave his active political career in order to address climate change in university education.
The former Minister admitted that the Prime Minister had constantly urged him to return to the top policy he had left two years ago.
He also stated that, like citizens, they know who will be Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, if the PSOE wins elections, his party wanted to announce the "transparent form" which will be chairman of Congress.
If Bono acquires this function, he hopes that the House will transform the House of Respect and Not of Worship or Scream and realizes that "it will ever be more and more like citizens".
"Unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid, where Congress cannot be spoken peacefully and peacefully, was interrupted by the Prime Minister in the Senate on one occasion."
Similarly, he spoke praisefully to the address of President Manuel Marín and his "good work" and did not want to present himself in his place so far as not to reduce himself to what his opponents might consider as "the greatness".
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is subject to unlovable persecution, both those who see skeptically on his predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must demonstrate strong consistency.
Moreover, having the leader of the movement, who is chairman of the government as Zapatero, and believes that this fight is more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and even going to sign the "new contract with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why the activity or inaction of his government has contributed significantly to Spain’s failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors this is happening and why his government, the government of the contract, has not prevented it.
Moreover, it makes it as clear as possible to explain to Spain what measures it intends to take to avoid climate change.
Which companies will be damaged by the damage that the habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, both individual and collective, we will have to adopt, and what it will have economic consequences.
In other words, who sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But we didn't wait to see that explanation.
Just because you need to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one cent from the price of gasoline, proposed by PSOE (Spain’s working socialist party), seemed so risky to Zapater in terms of choice that he had hurryed to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so it doesn't cost anything to pure propaganda, passwords lacking any real meaning.
The impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And contracts with the planet; this gentleman is so useful for electoral campaigns that he does not even speak, he does not plead anything, but he pleases them with possessions and encourages them.
If it is limited only to being a virtual contractual party and does not ask us to ride a bicycle and cool ourselves with a fan.
Mayor and chief of local police Totana arrested for suspected corruption practices in construction
As the investigators informed, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, "human" by José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and one businessman in the hospitality, for suspicion of committed crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his apartment and transferred to the town hall, where he is now located along with a number of policemen, who have also come to the Commission for Construction and the City Building Company with industrial land and flats.
These three arrests came to six, which took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation involving over 2 million hectares of agricultural land on land suitable for construction, so that the galic company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the previous term, could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but are charged with a reduced trial in the first instance of Totana.
Six first arrests were brought to court today.
According to information sources, the former Mayor of Totana is under investigation and today a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales.
In addition, his ex-wife, owner of the real estate office, registered today in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of Nuaria Group, lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigran (Pontevedar Province), as well as Pablo José M. G., Director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and over which the bribes were sent.
The investigation is carried out by a crime group in the construction of an operational unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to arrest, also carried out 11 inspections, mostly in companies related to arrests, based in Madrid, Vig, Murcia, Pontevezre, Las Rozas (Marid Province) and Totana.
In Totana, only one person was imprisoned, in the area of the very well-known owner of the company's products from poultry meat, which could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria group was entrusted with the largest residential complex in the town of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was overQuaded and its project was to double the settlement of the village, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in Coruňa, Venezuela and the Fernando el Católico square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.
And that happens.
One.
If you're not against, we'll leave the Book of Months behind, and maybe we'll be attacked by other awards and contests.
I already have something in my head.
Guys, life is a change.
Of course you can come up with ideas.
Two.
Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's release of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by way at the beginning of the report of the PISA program on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspapers printed on 18 November, on the same day that Blackburn's book also came up there in a coincidence:
"The scope of the subject of philosophy has penetrated public discussions in connection with the tragedy of the school in Jokel.
The victim's killer, a graduate of high school, quoted in his notes the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, a boardman responsible for the subject of the philosophy, requested Helsingin Sanomat’s website that the professors take a critical view of Plato and claimed that it is not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in a compulsory elementary course of philosophy in secondary schools."

One colleague shall inform of the introduction of a criminal offence of downloading from the internet to the Criminal Code:
A. A withdrawal of one song would be a crime with a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you lose less than €400 in the record shop, it is considered as a mere pre-departure (§ 623.1).
B. If you alienate up to EUR 1 000 in the store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for downloading (§ 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in fights than shifts of compacts.
Participation of the riot is at a rate from three months to one year (§ 154 of the Criminal Code) and would be a rate of six months to two years for the exchange of compacts.
(§ 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered, in accordance with § 184.2 of the Criminal Code, less serious than downloading the film into DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyright-protected films is punishable more than the provision of pornographic juvenile materials (§ 186).
So if my colleague wasn't wrong, she was running somebody's hand, and that's it.

My investigating physician shoves one of his articles on strange research called "Peace causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or feelings that trigger a monthly salary with employees depend on how many colleagues make money.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonances on the CT and results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernda Weber, the author of the study and leading group, the neurocogonist of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the participants of the research responded wrongly and his colleagues mistakenly."
Researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when they got one double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Balkans's almighty
Carla del Ponte has been inferred for eight years from the Court of Justice Prosecutor's office in The Hague, a criminal from the Balkans War.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla will leave mixed feelings, because the chief culprits of the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8 000 Bosen Muslims, former general Ratko Mladič and former leader of the Bosen Serbian Radovan Karadžič, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which he took over the name of the documentary film by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin List" (2006, not mentioned in Spain), which, at the rate of the detective thriller, follows from Belgrade to New York, the work of the Swiss prosecutor in pursuit of refugees and pressure on the respective states to draw the net.
What insurance is suitable for me?
The insurance of a car that protects the driver in the event of an accident is a significant expenditure that depends on various factors such as age, status, gender, length of possession of a driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Select suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to be clear on what we're talking about.
Insurance of a car is an agreement between an insurance and insured person.
This commitment takes the form of a insurance contract that provides that an insurance undertaking will receive an agreed insurance premium of a certain amount for taking into account the payment of damage in the event of an insurance event.
The insurance is the price to be determined taking into account different factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Insurance companies determine their prices on the basis of statistics, so the greater the likelihood of an accident, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both those aged 25 and women must pay lower insurance premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their care.
In the same way, insurance companies have come to the conclusion that persons living in marriage have fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way in which the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the drive, and the probability of having an accident.
The increase in driving frequency increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the insurance price.
Therefore, the driver must well examine the situation in order to choose such insurance as is best suited to his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variables to choose from or the type of insurance that, besides complying with the insurance policy type, will also be at reasonable price.
People under 25 are meeting with different disadvantages, such as little experience with driving and short driving licence possessions, when they want to negotiate insurance premiums at the price available.
Although it is ideal for good cover is insurance against all risks, there are cheaper options.
The most secure drivers may choose insurance against all risks with the lower risk in order to obtain insurance cover of all risks but at an acceptable price.
This type of contract would involve customer participation in the remuneration of the insurance event.
"The amount of the payment of the insurance event provided by the client will be determined in advance in determining the insurance price that would be higher than the lower would be involved", explains Luis Noguera, First Europe head of Spain, insurance intermediary online.
Another option is insurance extended to other users of the operation by insurance against damage caused by other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Recommendations.
If you are younger than twenty-five years old, try to be careful and avoid accidents as far as possible, because it will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce your insurance in the future.
Bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the other hand, the malus is the increase in the basic rate.
"Bonus and marus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, she will be able to afford to increase the bonus", explains Noguer.
After crossing the limit of twenty-five years, drivers are easier to negotiate insurance because the customer risk index decreases because of experience acquired.
For this reason, it is most recommended to negotiate insurance against all risks with a discount.
"The young people usually cannot take advantage of the experience gained in advance at the moment when the accident occurs and even when driving", assures the director of the European company in Spain and adds that most accidents occur in the second year of the proceedings when the "strach novice" was overcome.
However, if a client is married but has no children yet, it is better to negotiate insurance against all risks, provided that his economic situation permits it.
Families with children are considered to be an insurance company with the lowest risk index and therefore their losses will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against any risks with a discount of EUR 300, or at a high bonus, insurance extended to other participants in the operation, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Her driving is calmer and their purchase capacity is higher, so they can afford to get the highest discount," notes Luis Noguer.
Pensions are advised to cover all risks with a lower insurance premium (EUR 150) or insurance extended to other traffic participants if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects drivers in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expenditure, which is a reasonable reason to examine the insurance options that would suit us most because of our personal situation.
Celtic's trying to get a point on AC Milan, which means eight finals.
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their strength this Tuesday at the San Siro stadium in an attempt to get a point that they are missing to achieve their respective goals at the conclusion of the 'Champions' League, because for Italy it would mean being the first one and the Scottishs would decide to place it.
Italians have ten points and have already made progress in the fifth match with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs one more to make sure he doesn't get a Chessman with six points to play with Benfika, which has four.
These two matches of Group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, because AC Milan must play in an Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where for the first time he enters the thirteenth in the semifinal, in an attempt to enter the final, which is played by the 16th.
So this group will be closed before others and the undecided result at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems to be the most likely one, even though both men will attempt to face the victory because the Italians will not want to tact on domestic soil and Celtic knows that after the win he would be the first to secure a better place in the eight finals.
Gordon Strachan's manhood could even afford to lose even if Schachťor doesn't win, but he can't rely on it, because at the same number of nine points, the Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2:1), but won in the first direct game (2:0).
And so AC Milan will try to ruin the evening of the Scots who believe that they will get to the semifinals in the reorganized Champions League just like they beat them at the same game in the previous Kaka goal in extension (1:0) after the state of 0:0 at the basic game time.
Hope that the "rossoners" will win will be the Chesser, for which it is worth winning, only if Celtic lost, both for the procedure until the eighth and also for the maintenance in the UEFA.
Benfica, although it is last and has no chance to continue the highest European competition, could achieve one victory in a third place so that it would play in UEFA.
The first show of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls Group launched its first tour in Vancouver (Canada) before 20,000 audiences since it broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they opened their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver, declared that the reconnection of their group was "Great".
Some 20,000 people bought tickets so that they could be present, which also included a video that describes the history of this group, which caused a sensation at the end of the 1990s.
The return and world tour take place at the same time as the new album, released by the EMI in Spain, which brings the selection of their main successful songs as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on the stage decorated with bracelets, which the husband "Posh Spice" gave them, British footballer David Beckham.
This sportsman was in the audience that flooded GM Place, even though Victoria was upset a few days ago.
Before the beginning of the performance Victoria Beckham, she said about the British star that "he didn't even see our costumes, so I'm nervous about what she'd think of the performance."
"Sports Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the contradictions between us" caused two years later the dissolution of the five-member group, also demonstrated its nervousness in meeting with the journalists two hours before the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion changed, the opinion on Spice Girls changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made up my mind," Chisholm said about the reconnection of the group that she himself dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that, in time, "the things adjusted and we all love each other."
However, a lot of things have changed since Spice Girls got together in 1998.
In the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver with a special Virginia Airlines.
At the arrival, the nanny army was expected at the airport.
Five has seven children in total.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will perform in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5th and 7th December).
He'll be in Madrid on December 23.
Fear of a new gas fight between Russia and Ukraine
There is an ongoing dispute between Russia and Ukraine on the price of natural gas, thereby increasing the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel may be affected to Western Europe.
Most Russian fuels exported to the European Union (EU) are transported through Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow lifts Ukraine's gas prices, Russia will charge higher transit fees.
Previous disputes between these two last years have reduced deliveries to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes when the Ukrainian government and the Russian State owned by the gas monopoly, Gazprom, trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says he will have to charge more Ukraine because he has agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas obtained from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from the Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transit countries during the negotiations," said the Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinach.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments concerning the amount of transit charges (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev resulted in a reduction of supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a sharp drop of exports to Western Europe, which rapidly increased prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas supply in the world, but a large part of it remains insufficiently exploited.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The controller said that the Scottish NHS chambers must improve the control of criminal records for non-European employees.
The recommendation from President Robert Black's Supreme Control Office came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was connected to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the amount of foreign personnel employed.
But his report pointed out that the other key checks were in order to sample five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office shall be interested immediately after June attacks at Glasgow Airport on personnel obtained from countries outside the European Economic Area.
The eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hit Jeep at the front terminal door.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using video footage accused of attempting to engage in bombing attacks in Great Britain.
The NHS chamber is expected to check out foreign personnel with regard to qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in the UK prior to his job.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses the Disclosure Scotland to control criminal records, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The President's report says, in addition to other recommendations, that the Commission should be allowed to lead the Criminal Records Bureau directives, which help employers with controls in several countries.
"Although we have discovered that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks are not regularly carried out," the report said.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS is in many line with its own pre-employment review policy, but he also added: "Our report draws attention to areas where the system could be improved in order to ensure that accurate information about foreign personnel is available."
President BMA Scotland Dr. Peter Terry said he was "very unlikely" to identify potential NHS employees who might commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that current pre-employment checks in the Scottish NHS work well and it is not clear what other value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish Health Authorities have announced that they currently have 161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these numbers would probably be higher also because the Commission had a problem identifying personnel with residence permits.
The survey also found that the established control procedures for NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely implemented.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently transforming the policy and the directive on pre-employment checks for foreign workers of the NHS.
Health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said, "I wanted to do this job immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow airport."
She also added that the Scottish Government, in conformity with the Health Commissions, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that best practices appear in updated directives for the pre-employment checks of all personnel - including foreign - which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division controlled film prices
Control, a feature movie about the late singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five awards at British Independent Film Awards, including the prizes for the best film.
The prizes were also won by Sam Riley, who worked at the warehouse until Curtis, director Anton Corbian, and in the side role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named the best actress for the thriller Records on the scandal.
And Daniel Craig's bondove star won the Variaty Award for getting a British movie on the world scene.
The prizes were presented at the Roundhouse of London.
Control describes Curtis' way to glory with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was only £3 million.
But he won a Dutch photographer to Corbian, formerly known for the iconic cover of the album U2 Joshua Tree, two prizes - for the best director and for the best debut director.
Rock music was aimed at another award - because the film Juliena Temple about the singer Clash Joe Strummer won the prize for the best document.
Vigo Mortensen was awarded the best actor's head as a driver of Russian Mafia boss in London's thriller David Cronenberg Eastern oath.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation built on the roles of tough men, won Richard Harris' award for an extraordinary contribution to the British film.
This 50-year-old, among whose films include Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is now filming further works by Indiana Jones, the Kingdom of crystal skulls.
Winston said he was proud of this award, which is named after the film star Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened doors for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, the great actor of my time, I'm very honored."
Independent film prices, known as the Bify, are awarded by a jury meeting filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
One of Bif's advocates and patrons belongs to Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people because of terrorist conspiracy
The Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it arrested 208 militants because of the membership of cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities and also on spiritual and security ingredients.
The state television of the largest oil exporter said that one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
The sympathizers of al-Qaeda have conducted a campaign against monarchy, United States allies, since 2003, i.e. from invasion to Iraq.
The TV report announced that the cells of eight militants led by a foreigner were planning an attack on the oil treatment of Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia builds a unit of rapid response to the power of 35,000 members to defend the facility from the failed attack of al-Qaeda on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal declaration: 18 arrests belonged to a cell run by "expert on launching missiles", which slipped into the ground.
She also stated that the military were planning to smuggle eight shots into the kingdom.
22 detained were to prepare the murder of spiritual and security personnel.
The government urged the clergy to try more to prevent Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda military forces and Shiite government supported by the U.S., which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider to be here.
The Al-Qaida militants believe that the authorities have copied many clergy in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
Military - supported by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden - focused on the late Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and power equipment.
"This war was a huge effort by security forces in the past five months," said the State Television Internal spokesperson of the Ministry.
16 members of the "medial cell" in Medina were also arrested, which was intended to promote "trophyrian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims identified as disbelief and apostasy.
There were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to the military.
The Climate on Venus is perhaps a insight into the future of the Earth
The scientists yesterday announced that Venus could once be a pleasant place for life.
Data from the current European Station show that the planet is even more similar to the Earth's head double than it thought before.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the Earth.
These two worlds are about as big and circumstantial, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago there were conditions similar to those on Earth in Venus, and could also be residents.
But the flushed greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion of solar radiation, and lower rotation rate sent Venus on a completely different way of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is pretty hot on the melting of lead and it is destroyed by storms and winds with the power of hurricane.
The findings from the probe of the European Space Agency Venus Express, which studied the planet for one year, offer a sober view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of Oxford University physics department and one of Venus Express leaders said: "It's getting clearer why the Venus climate is so different from Earth, even though the planets themselves are different.
"Our new data enable us to set up a script in which Venus began as well as the Earth, perhaps even with the environment, billions of years ago."
Police are holding "the enriched uranium"
Some radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was arrested yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesperson said that three people were detained and that the material was examined.
He didn't confirm that this was a enriched uranium, but he said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480 000 pounds).
Is it still open?
Mitt Romney said that it is not decent for the presidential candidates to answer questions from the snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates subsequently agreed to the YouTube debate, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions for video and handed them over to the candidates sent them.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday, November 28 were as comical as the snowman who asked the Democrats for global warming in the debate of the other party on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected many about the situation of the Republican Party going to elections next year.
It is not clear exactly how CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, chose clips that were then shown to aspiration candidates.
But the first half of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the strongest Republican topics.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to turn the wheel when they heard something comforting: the voter noted the peaks of consent when the candidates were talking about a hard approach at the borders.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who was in the key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of a man who was soft to illegal immigrants like the Mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, blaming the former Governor of the state of Massachusetts for hiring illegal immigrants to work on his home.
These two struggled in particular when the challengers asked whether one of the candidates would support "amnesty" (the next to illegal immigrants normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
A junior candidate like Duncan Hunter, California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, Congressman from Colorado, were able to put theirs in a mill on this subject.
None of these two have a chance to nominate, but they both stay in the game perhaps for starting to hit the alarms due to immigration earlier and more strongly than others.
At least immigration candidates have an roughly the same view: greater strictness at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, together with the fears of poisonous toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps the Republicans forget or minimize the conflict between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate started to get very uncomfortable when there were other issues.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why in the past he supported possession of firearms.
John McCain and Mr. Romney were discussing whether the simulation technique should be considered torture.
One questioner asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Even though the Bible is his favorite book, Mr. Giuliani does not seem to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another father asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now opposed to all assumptions in the first place in the recent survey in Iowa due to his long - term Christian conservative - said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, thus earning laughter.
The fight remains extremely open.
Mr. Huckobe's growing up in Iowa is hiding with recent successes in earning money and with Ron Paul's loud voice during the middle debate.
These two have gone away from the bottom, because both wings of the party still cannot agree on known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate united the party very soon and convincedly with the winning report of American size on lips, mutilating both wings of the party.
This time, the party is divided, and the result is far from clear.
Labourist Pains
Gordon Brown found another trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary for British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
No orders appear to be sold, no accounts in the Paris Hotel have been secretly paid, no extra-marriage rings are being smoked.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would go around without discovering that some wealthy businessman for four years masked the contributions of the ruling Labour Party of £650,000 ($1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided election and insulted the British intelligence by saying that this decision was not affected by surveys, there was hope that it would ensure a durable and effective government.
Instead, as the more and more humorous President of the Liberal Democrats put it, the once called Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
Unburdened rescue of North Rock's troubled bank showed weaknesses in control and low judgment under fire.
Bad thought-out proposals to change the tax law brought companies together against the government.
Loss of personal data in 25 million people have revealed unimaginable administrative systems.
Troika generals retired started rioting in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending because they claimed being commander of the armed forces to be part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary-General of Labourists (and their former internal discipline guard), he has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown would be irreversibly headed to his end.
Despite this, governments can reach the point of overturning, where they find heavy governance.
The people don't trust politicians, and they don't like them, but they usually push away their distrust when they take over the new group.
When it seems clear that some Prime Minister is probably not going to improve anything, and it doesn't have to be in office for a long time, this shift is gone: the government administration becomes a big deal, ministers start making briefingy, the press looking for bad news, and the government becomes unfocused and defensive.
In one direction, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, for he cannot take the position of a new broom against other political leaders.
As much as he'd like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the records of the Financial Office are linked to decisions made by Mr Brown as Minister of Finance.
And even if he was not directly involved in blairov's troubles, such as the long investigation of political parties' funding caused by the "worth of Money", voters can easily judge that he was.
Yet, they're not as bad as they look as Mr. Brown's trouble.
Those ruffles aren't as terrible as conservatives do.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one died or was deceived.
And treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what the Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown have always promised: a reliable, firm and slightly brutal government.
The latest start around political donations is a good example.
The Garboid Lord Abrahams, who compares his gifts with charity, says he did not wish for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision wasn't on him.
The laws against the anonymity of the great political donors are clear and there are for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams' conduct, but didn't know that he was illegal, will certainly be questioned carefully; as well Jon Mendlesohn, the chief Labourer of the money that he learned about the obscene gifts in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these skins, even though the main part of the payments took place after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but determined his determination by following a good instrument, commission to investigate this matter - led by the bishop in his pension and judge.
In this case, learning is not complicated.
If the law is breached, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman of an independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has not been there for six months, and following the real reform of the funding of political parties.
This would require laborists who are in a narrow position to cooperate with conservatives and perhaps give up their special financial relationship with unions - bitter pills for a dedicated party like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Consumers now have a decent lead in their surveys; he has two years to get his voters back; and the only way to win is by immeasurable integrity and high competence.
Carded sharks
Does the crisis affect the subpriority mortgages of the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, they naturally start to slip around in excruciatingly.
Now that the US real estate market is squandering, the predators have focused on the credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that losses on credit cards, if subordinate mortgages were to be ordered by other variants of consumer credit, could reach $99 billion.
The voltage signs are clear.
The increase in in inability to pay (more than 30-day late payments) and write-off accounts (accounts that the provider considers to be negligible).
The HSBC bank announced last month that the US consumer credit market lost 1.4 billion dollars - also due to insolvency credit card loans.
However, it is still early to panic.
The accounts that have been saved and the inability to pay them are still low.
According to Moody's evaluation agency, 3.89% of the insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost by a percentage point below the average.
The deterioration rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in US law on personal bankruptcy in 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported defaults that make a large part of credit-card losses; the number of reportings (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore increase regardless of whether the general conditions for lenders deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good maturity rate, which shows how many consumers will pay monthly out of their debts.
And trust in credit card securities is solid, despite paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup's research company predicts that the volume of their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct routes for spreading infection between sub-priority mortgages and credit card markets certainly exist: when they dry out real estate loans, consumers will rather owe themselves through credit cards.
However, lenders of credit cards tend to look at cash flows rather than the values of the guaranteed items, so falling home prices do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of the lenders.
They may even be beneficial for lenders.
The motivation of consumers to pay off mortgages when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards goes up to the list of priorities for repayment.
The card issuers will also be able to respond more quickly and flexiblely to more alarming conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid changes in price of guarantee subjects.
"It doesn't happen that one beautiful morning we'll just re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Head of Capital One.
Although the risk of an explosion in the style of subordinate mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakening is much more real.
If lower house prices and debt reductions push America into recession, the credit card sector will stand in front of the darker future.
Watch out for the back fins.
British bankers pleaded guilty about the Enron case
The three British bankers who were supposed to be indicted for their role in fraud linked to the former financial manager of Enron Andrew Fastow, changed their testimony on Wednesday and admitted guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew initially blamed seven fraud charges, when they were supposed to participate in financial fraud together in 2000 -- enrich themselves in the employer's account -- they denied it.
They're supposed to be in January before the trial.
However, during a court trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former Greenwich NatWest executives, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has been on the front page for two years, which has lasted the performance process.
In the United States, their case is one of the uninterrupted parts of the investigation beginning after Enron's 2001 crash.
The charges brought against them in 2002 pointed out by Mr Fastov that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron crash.
The prosecution against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWestern Three" -- claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to enforce fraud together with Fastow and his former Chief Lieutenant Michael Kopper.
The company Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's affiliate branch controlled by Fastow, which was an architect of the many enron frauds that were pushing Enron after the spiral towards making bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share in this branch zero, but our three British knew it was in fact of considerable value.
The company under Kopper's control bought the bank's share in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminated bankers paid Kopper a $20,000 stake in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow has falsely informed Enron that the energy company will pay for its share in this branch of Greenwich NatWest $20 million.
But the 20 million were actually British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers were charged with 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper, and others had an increase of about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted guilty in two cases of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently performing a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
The coper is in prison three years and one month at the Texarn facility.
All three British people were free to bail $1 million, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming court.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, fell into bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of billing tricks could no longer be possible to hide billions of debts or show failing speculation as profit.
The collapse has abolished thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion of market value, and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted of their roles in the collapse of the company last year.
Skilling is in the execution of more than 40 years of punishment.
Judging Lay for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were erased after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow Non-powerlessness
The price of the jet Gulfstream G550 equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine and with a sufficient fuel volume for nonstop years from Moscow to Los Angeles starts at $54 million.
But for some of the Russian rich, they're small to be returned.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of the Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many places because it's for the close family or corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millennium Exhibition, which is a four-day orgy of showy consumption in a mom's exhibition center at the capital sanatorium.
In addition to the Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers have built their stand, hoping that freshly rich Russians are plowing to everything from the mahagon of unloading yachts to diamonds decorated with barriers to cars that would not be ashamed of 50 Cents.
Mr. Firer carefully looked at the bright orange Porsche in the side booth.
"That's a nice car, but against us they're fives and tens," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
On the oil waves, there is a lot of money in the Russian capital, just like when Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stage in the '80s when some Americans were tremendously rich and dragged to Europe, where they were viewed as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, listener of the fourth year at Davis's center of Russian and Euroasian Harvard studies.
Just like the Saudi bouncers of the '70s and the Japanese in the '90s, the Russians became the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their work on this Klondik.
In another place in Moscow this week, the conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of the LVMH Group, brought together ideas about how to sell expensive goods on markets such as the Russian one.
(Conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia, according to the list of the richest people, has a $53 billion magazine with a total fortune of $282 billion.
In addition, the local central institute in the field of Center for Economic and Financial Research published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103 000 "second" millionaires in Russia, whose assets in the sum amounting to $670 billion.
(The World Bank notes that 15.8% of the Russians lived below the existential minima in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, the sales and marketing representative of the London jewel shop David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, along with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly prepared, and men are all worth the fortune."
When they walked through the evening dresses on Sunday night halls, the 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatov and five years older Lightlan Turov marked themselves as millionaires as their clients.
"I looked at the car and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatot, who was hallucinating in the branded clothing as a veteran of the red carpets, next to which Joan Rivers looks like a home girl.
The trade fair seemed to be focused mainly on fresh wealthes, noticeably controlled Russian buyers, who are willing to sit a few hours in road traffic, in order to be able to go through the warehouse, which is famous for Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fishes, Mövenpick ice cream, peace pool tables, apartments in Dubai, sails Gund and dust.
Members of the public could have bought tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russian are interested in what is the most expensive and best brand," said Mr Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch manufacturer of porcelain Royal Delft before reproduction of Rembrandt's painting of hand-painted blue ducks in overlife.
Of course, Russians are more interested in this.
Indeed, the sellers here say that the Russians with old money (under the Russian standards are 10 to 15 years old) have already shifted from shiny logos to little known signs of limited editions that would never appear at the shopping fair.
Even a few thousand people, whether the millionaires, the ambassadors of the millionaires, or the foresight of tourists, were flooded by the fair halls every day.
And some of them bought.
The first day of the show, last Thursday, said Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil's bed that sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, touched with gold threads, after $700,000.
Also, on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, the sales manager of A1 Moto, who runs high-end cars with high-end alarms, said that his company sold a clear orange Porsche for $10,000 Russian millionaires.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karpetian, President of L.A. Connection, who, on request, regulates luxury cars, sold three bars to cars in style connected to the chain bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantomy after $55,000.
He showed the reporter's car bike designed for the Russian owner of the casino, which had an extract of Swarov's covered crystals so that it looked like a roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"That Russian millionaire, who wants to bikes of dogskins or portrait of his wife from a cryll-circumcision, does not have to ride on those wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"They're put in their garage by 30 to 40 cars."
Even though many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "ruský millionaire" does not mean much exclusive at the moment, given the large price increase of the property here.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, when not in cash," he said.
"There's more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least fake the wealth of the tent operated by the Russian Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company drew up four British-style red phone booths, squeezed by a column of fake bills worth millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500 000 fake bills for the Millionaire Trade Fair.
They stopped by the neighborhood to throw away a bunch of money, or to get your friends to take a photo of their mobile phone, resting in the middle of their spare wealth, or just squeezing out a couple of millions of dollars.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey perhaps caused by a corrupt operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the local restaurant About something healthier and watched an ambulance that came to a white New English house two houses away from West Scott Avenue.
Soon the police patrol car joined.
And then another one.
"Why did I see the doctor's van arrive," said Mr Livingston, restaurant controller.
"At that moment, I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41 years old, an assistant director of the New York Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died of an unlicensed plastic surgeon, whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at West Scott Avenue's house number 212.
The authorities have not yet established what caused Ms. Arroy's death, and they hope that the toxicology tests, whose results may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that the New York police has sent out a wave of sorrow through the leadership of the New York police.
Miss Arroy has been assistant police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tough, and worked hard," said McCarthy of Miss Arroy in telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York police officer who works for the Commission to control alcoholic beverages, and that she leaves two sons behind at the age of 14 and 11 and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson of the U Union, Theodora J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to find out if Ms. Arroy died of an unlicensed surgical operation.
"It's one of the options," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still in progress."
The authorities said that they arrived at the house about three hours in the afternoon of 21.
November and they found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead on the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities kept saying little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is reported to be Flore Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't tell me if Ms. Castro's authorities heard.
The investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
In the middle of Miss Castro's house, with a broken pink bush in front of the garden and a Dalmatian barking back, no one responded
In addition to the doors that led to the cellar, he throned in an open garage a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes were hanging on one side of the hook.
Mr. McCarthy remembered that when he first arrived after 25 years in New York Police Department, Ms. Arroy provided him with invaluable assistance in the procession of the intolerance and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'For this or this, you should be careful," he said.
"She was always here when I came in, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that Fed will reduce interest rates leads to the strengthening of world exchanges
The stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic came yesterday after the market’s hope that the Federal Bank would attempt to calm the lending conditions by further reducing the interest rates was strengthened by a calming statement by the Vice-President of the American Central Bank.
The storms jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in line behind Ben Bernank, Chairman of Fed, said that in responding to continued pressure on the financial markets, the managers must be "flexible and pragmatic".
As part of the obvious effort to calm the highlighted markets in the midst of signs of a lifelong credit effort, Mr Kohn said that the recent riots "partly returned some improvements in the functioning of the markets at the end of September and October".
He also stated that if increased instability persists, the possibility for financial conditions to be further worsened by households and firms will increase.
Investors consider these statements to be a signal that Fed is ready to add further fresh capital benefits to the US markets and possibly further reductions in interest rates to stabilise the credit conditions.
These comments also helped calm Wall Street in the middle of other bad news about the American economy when sales of flats in October showed record low numbers.
The effects of the financial belief were undermined by notification by the Investment Bank Bear Stearns to cancel 650 jobs, which is 4 % of its world workforce, as a result of the reduction of costs due to compensation for the heavy losses caused by the non-introduction stake in the provision of subordinate housing loans in America.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew up by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and it concluded 13 289.40, while more of the S&P 500 index used increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6,06,2, with the value of the British blue-chips rising by more than £39 billion.
The German Dax Index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, the credit tension on the markets was shown in full force after the auction of the three-month cash packages of the European Central Bank was loaned to European commercial banks at a rate of 4,7 %, most since April 2001.
The pressure on the English Bank to follow Fed and the ECB to release over-standard money on London’s money markets has increased with the result that the rates of three-month British interbank loans "Libor" have risen after uninterrupted growth since 12 November to their maximum since the end of September – 6.59 percent.
England has to decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, almost as hard as the other.
Who will be number six on the fight for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in the wider context of nothing less relevant than the first test against Sri Lanka, who has to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, President of the Selection Commission, who adheres to this post at best in the time spent, has Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, captain, with decision to help, and since the Hugh Morris table, the main manager of the English team, begins to perform applications for the post of a national collector, although not necessarily full-time.
Whoever does not build a sixth place on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is no longer fair.
It's not easy to find what one gets at the top of his profession, while someone else never gets over a lower level, sometimes because of a lack of luck rather than an ability.
Not only in the circle is the choice demanding and requires judgment, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is there a good time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, if you do?
We could also ask in another area, say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young leaders with good education and an overview in the field, should be promoted to the committee - the place is only for one.
Who's to say which level is right for cricketers if he can't get a chance to fall or swim on the next one?
Naturally, the numbers have great influence on decision-making, but they still have opportunities.
The team has to capture the captain's view of the team at the right moment if he's to take the winket, and the heater needs a regular chance at starting positions if he's ever to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
It's more complicated to capture the look of the collector.
For example, last season was a lot better than James Anderson, whose place in the first test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself a healthy and over-represented as a artillery.
Anderson took 32 Wickets in first class at 33 shifts each.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 on the same average, but they both had their moments at the highest level and hope for another.
If he plays at Asgiriya Shah stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can run or finish careers both, or it may not have a great influence.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and in the first class served good performances, five Wickets and 40 permitted runs, but it was Paul Collingwood who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable test cricketer, who is additionally, although in Australia against Australia he recorded twice a hundred points, may still be underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow one further discussion following today's training cleanly at the stadium of Asiggia, follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shaho's greater experience in front of Bopar's youth boom.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shaha, he speaks his sparkly and valuable debut test at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in the first class compared to six Bopar, which is, in twenty years, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spins.
However, Shah made his two shifts in May against the Caribbean at the Lord's Test, his home field in Middlesex, just ten runs, and that, together with the immediate rejection of the collectors, when Vaughan wanted to reintroduce him for the next match, his firing seems to have taken something from the elite that was so evident in Bombay.
On the other hand, the Essex University has joie de Vivre in its bones.
On the cricket field, he has nothing to drink from and his behavior outside the playground symbolizes recently overturned car with a drive for four rounds on the exhibition day of the automotive sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He was struck with slight injuries and probably shock, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who followed him away to ask him excitedly, "Have you seen him?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his moderately fast loopy pitches on the heresets that seem to suit him, giving away effectively and launches confidence and skillfully.
Selecting the right person is one thing to choose the right time is different.
Maybe it's the true art of choice.
Personally, I'm going to have Bopara get his chance now, which I don't want to say Shah is not going to excite if, as the chilon tea passes suggest, he's the one who's going to play next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaida
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began coming to Baghdad yesterday to dump refugees who ran out of money or expired on visas, and others who hoped the city would return to normal life.
Some of them even came back to fight the gunmen who drove them out of their homes.
Mansurian bus station was before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government convoy on dozens of buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who came back in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubajsi, Sunni doctor.
"Today I came back because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the paper, because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia of the military spiritual Muctada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop the fight.
Kásim al-Atrani, an eight-year-old Shiite teacher of the largely Sunni region of Amarai, returned with his two children because he could no longer restore Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amaría called him, and they urged him to return with the support of the U.S. military.
One of the newly arrived in Jordan is the leader of the Sunni tribe and Shiite tribe, which from his home in Sleikhu in northern Baghdad banished the grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"By the end of a few friends called me and told me that she's running off in Sleikhu by a militia against al-Qaida and that she needs me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have talked about the attraction of calming in the capital after the strengthening of the American military presence and the growth of local 'group of captive citizens', which weapons defend their fourths by side of the U.S. military.
But more about the fact that more than 1.3 million Iraqis escaped to come back.
Salaam al-Samarraj, the 21st-year-old father of three children, spoke out loudly of the suspicions shared between refugees that Núri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian Government to impose restrictions on the visa of refugees and thus forced them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people escaped from Iraqi sectarian murderers.
"It was all right before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis to have to go back to Iraq," said Sunni pensioner.
"I can't believe the government that supports the criminals who burned me after I left the house."
The partial reason for weakening violence is that the sunni have been forced out of the Shia areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tension.
There is concern that the sudden influx of refugees is reassuring the sectary tension and will lead to further struggle.
Tiny Sarka, good education
The smallest Land of Germany plays a leading role in vocational education, it also enhances the international focus of its universities.
In one educational area alone, Sarsko is concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"A man who does not come from Saxony yesterday, I explained after fifty that we are not a Frenchman" - this self-ironic password appears on posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birthday of this smallest federal country.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) at the fifth place.
Colleges are traditionally working closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can end the study with a double or even triple diploma.
A corresponding adequately high share of foreign students, which amounts to 15.6%.
After all, the overaverage number of Sarah children is accepted to college, many of them even without studies at the gymnasium.
"Axel Plünnecke, IW Educational Expert is used in Sarsk.
By more than every fifth juvenile will be entitled to study at the vocational training centre, Sarsko is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Sarska to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities to study two branches are given the population of the second best in all Germany.
Despite virtually oriented education and rising demand, the number of graduates of engineering about a third has decreased in recent years.
Therefore, the Department of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign on engineering fields.
"After the first study of Pis, we did several reforms in general in education," says the Minister of Education.
The government therefore carried out comparative tests throughout Germany.
To learn as soon as possible, the last year of maternity school is free - a model that also takes over other federal countries.
If the student's results improve significantly, they'll show up for future comparative studies.
In the implementation of the Pisa study in 2003, risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20 %.
But Sarsko did not get better as much as other federal countries.
The entertainers can count better.
And in order to disappoint Sarska studies of Pisa do not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise Sarsko could be a point in this area.
The language of neighbors is compulsory on gymnastics, even though the inhabitants of Sarska are not the French.
Do you want to move the clock?
What they don't see is an hour in Venezuela other than the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez will have to move his hours back in this South American country.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a ridiculous figure.
The official letter of Venezuela informed that hours according to the new act against the world's time would shift by minus four and a half hours.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
You understand, enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by forcing the United States to distribute time zones throughout the hours.
At the centre of local time Chávez further announced that he had been in relations with neighbouring Colombia for bailing with hostages.
This left-wing nationalist has declared that as long as Alvaro Uribe is a president of Colombia, he will not even be associated with the Colombian government.
"I cannot, because of my self-respect," Chávez said, who advocates the reform of the Constitution, which citizens of this oil country must vote on Sunday's referendum.
This reform would make Chávez greatly stronger in the country.
The fight caused Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels to release hostages.
Uribe criticized Uribe Chávez on Sunday by his decision, Venezuela 'he spit in the face'.
Everyone's talking about Chávez in Spain, too.
The new mobile ring has started here: "Porqué no these calls" (Why are you no longer silent?) - so is the sentence that has already been downloaded from the internet more than half a million people.
She was spoken by the Spanish King Juan Carlos, who, at the recent ibero-American summit, had voiced notes from this left-wing populist so much that he had silenced him in this way.
Germany in 2007 threatened to pay lower wages
According to the forecast, German employees are facing a real wage reduction this year despite a strong conjunctrum.
Experts justified their pessimistic forecast for a whole range of reasons.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees can actually count on less wages than last year.
"The guilt bears a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax and price increases in food and energy," said Bild Gustav Horn of the Research Institute of IMK (Institut für Macroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
The new load on employees may also be pending in the field of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that, for a new year, the planned reduction in unemployment contributions to 3.3% is right and reasonable in this situation.
However, a joint employment agency would no longer be able to fall into such difficulties as to require loans or contributions from the Federal Youth, to quote the newspaper of this social democratic policy.
On Tuesday it was published that the price explosion of food and petroleum products forced inflation into its highest state in the last 13 years.
In the annual comparison, the total price increased by three percent.
Venus is Hell's Twin Earth
Despite its life as an enemy atmosphere, Venus is more similar to the Earth's assumption. The European Space probe Venus Express on Venus has seen phenomena that appear on Earth in winter: lightnings in the atmosphere and windy beliefs on the poles.
For almost three decades, scientists have been aware of the fact that Venusha is missing.
Now the European probe Venus Express brought evidence - captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. The lightnings fly from the cloud to the cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometres, wrote in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to the well-known theory of the formation of primary matter on Earth, life could have caused lightning. Storms reportedly caused reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, fundamental stones of life.
In Venus it was not that way: "If there ever existed a life there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere is about 100 times thicker than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"In fact, it may be a hell of a twin earth, but it is a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which is the matter and the size of the earth so similar, began to develop differently, is the fundamental question of mission Esa.
Since no probe has been sent since the early 1990s for Venus, the start of Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in this planet's research.
According to scientists, the latest results of research, which approached several articles of Nature magazine, did not highlight only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighbouring planet is more similar to the Earth than it had previously assumed," Esa said.
In addition to already known wind fairs on the north pole, scientists have found a cloudy breeze on the southern pole, which is turning much faster.
This phenomenon reminds air currents on the northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second largest planet of our solar system is almost the same matter as Earth and with an average of 12 100 km is almost as big.
This planet, called Jitranka or Evening, will be killed by the Sun for nearly 225 days.
Around its own axis, however, turns a lot slower, one day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus’s surface temperature of 460 °C and 92 bars does not remind Earth, scientists say that both planets have arisen under very similar conditions.
But on both sides, there was water, and on Earth it remained in the oceans, while Venus disappeared into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound on Earth in carbonates, Venusha makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends the meeting of Merkel with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands the termination of party disputes for the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office.
He did not directly criticize the SPD for her attacks on the chancellor after a mutual meeting in September.
The joint president, Horst Köhler, is worried about Germany's reputation and calls on the large coalition to put an end to the svár around the adoption of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves outside as a nation which is not uniform in this question," Köhler said to the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU)’s decision to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have a universal effect on me," Köhler said.
Although the Federal President stressed that everyone knew that Germany had to maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, it did not prevent Merkel from coming when it was calculated to create a new policy against China.
"The Polish Chancellor has not left the traditional politics of the Single China.
China also knows," Köhler said.
The Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly showed his disapproval with the adoption of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by coalitions.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, to the 'presidency' of foreign coalition policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office, German-China relations got worse.
Not only did the GOC cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also froze according to SPiegel magazine.
The Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognise that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept Tibetan spiritual leader, stressing Wen Jibao China’s position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas, which are also located in China, is trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns against similar concerns that have occurred in France
Street battles with the police, shootouts, hot cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar riots that have burst in France.
We must do everything to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not grow into violence on the street, calling on the Federal Minister of Interior.
The barricades were burned, the rioters fired shotguns to the police. After severe juvenile riots in France, the Federal Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is worried about similar developments in Germany as well.
"We must be careful not to create such social tensions in our country that will break into violence.
We have to take this seriously," said Neue Presse in the Hanover newspaper.
Not every young person can deal with rapid changes in social reality.
The Federal Government, the countries and municipalities are already working hard to eliminate problems, said Schäuble.
Which does not mean simply integrating migrants.
"From the summit on Integration after the Islam conference, we record the first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs were not comparable to those of France.
In recent nights they introduced youth with police on the northern suburbs of Paris, hard street combat.
Even in Toulouse, cars and buildings burned down.
More integration efforts by the German Government have been demanded by the chairman of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned against the "agreement effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that under 25 years of age from migrant families, the unemployment rate was "averagely high".
First of all, more study opportunities are needed.
Kolat stressed: "We must give youth hope."
However, the chairman of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike France, there is a greater social control of families.
Moreover, many youths from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
The rooster urged, "But we have to be careful."
We need to allow young people to start working and education quickly.
Meanwhile, the night on the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained largely calm.
There were hundreds of police officers in the deployment, and there was a helicopter flying through the areas with headlamps.
Authorized authorities reported three arrests and several burnt trash baskets and cars.
Since yesterday, about 1,000 regular forces have been in charge of peace.
Police will intervene as long as it is necessary, she announced after the visit of the Home Secretary Michelle Alliot-Marie.
About 80 police were injured on Tuesday night in riots in the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, there was a riot of Toulouse.
The disorder caused a Sunday traffic accident in which two youths lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the state's representation, the police are not guilty to the death of minors.
In Angela's Empire "Glass"
The Chancellor's reality of the remote output documents that coalition is programmable at the end and that we cannot expect anything more from it alone.
What country does this Chancellor live in?
After her unsatisfying, indifferently sounding and contentious speech at the general debate of the Society of Snow, we must conclude: not here - not in this country, which it should manage after all.
For the record, she concentrated too much on foreign policy, answered Angela Merkel once with a very arrogant sentence.
That's guilty, she said, and she showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics are up to.
In Spok's dream, she visibly demonstrated how much she deserves that regret.
From Merkel, he wasn't even really interested, let alone feelings for problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Gladka" was presented: a political woman who stands out over the others, who is fleeing to foreign politics, and it is also expressed only in mischief.
Thus, for example, climate protection: without ceasing the conclusions of the Heiligendam summit, is no longer saying how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And all of a sudden, such self-loathing - so much unspeakability would have forgiven the President of the CDU two years ago.
Now it's limited to plain phrases that could increase the promise of people.
With this approach, it damages its own pragmat, which does not need to flatter, because problems solve.
But in Angela's realm, "Glass" are internal political problems of marginality.
Child poverty and concern for people with low wages?
A few side sentences about these subjects are left with her.
It is worth noting how often Merkel, when it comes to additions to children, speaks.
She has to start three times from the beginning, so she can speak at least partly the right sentence.
As soon as things are too specific, they're stumbling like in an entirely foreign area.
Department Attack
The debate of Republican Presidential candidates for Youtube in the case of favors by Rudy Giuliani and Mitta Romney has been dissipated in a sharp discussion - and both must be afraid of the outside candidate.
The two candidates are already in favour of the first issue.
Mitt Romney precedes his opponent Rudy Guiliani that he made New York an "a refuge for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp remarks: "I believe his own house was just one such refuge," he answers and presumes the former governor of Massachusetts, that he privately employed immigrants without proof.
As the Republican base does not yet have a clear favor, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute, Internet users filmed and through Youtube sent videos serve only as such hints of the key theme.
"We have allowed Hitler to take power to such a policy of isolationism," says John McCain to his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one to promote the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
The Vietnamese veteran McCain does not investigate with his accusations or Romney, for refusing to condemn the torture method of questioning called Waterboarding, during which heating is simulated.
The reaction of the audience in St. Petersburg in Florida shows that there is no war in Iraq, nor torture methods among the important themes of the campaign.
The obscenity breaks in applause whenever conservative values are praised and future increases in taxes have been rejected.
That's how it turns out where lies the weaknesses of both favorites.
"I was wrong at that time," explains Romney, asking the party base and the TV audience for forgiveness for the fact that he was still behind the implementation of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first rule in a civilian
A day after his resignation from the position of Chief Commander of the Army, Pakistani ruler Musharaf made a presidential oath.
That concludes eight years of military government in Pakistan.
On Thursday, the President of Pakistan Parvíz Musharaf made a presidential oath, thus remaining in the presidential office for another five years.
Pakistan’s television was a live ceremony held at the President’s Palace in the capital city of Islamabad.
Musharaf swore he would honor the constitution and seek the welfare of the nation.
In the midst of his office, the chief commander of the army handed over to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyanim, which subjected to international pressure, especially from the U.S.
Eight years after a violent military coup took power, the former general ruled for the first time as a civilian head of state.
The withdrawal from the position of Chief Commander of the Armed Forces met Musharaf one of the main requirements of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional state which Musharaf declared on November 3rd.
According to the Chief Prosecutor, Malik Muhammad Qayuma will cancel Musharaf’s emergency status soon after his arrival and thus fulfil other requirements of the West.
The supreme court of the country which Musharaf, after the announcement of the exceptional state at the beginning of November, has enjoined him, in the past week, rejecting all objections to the disputed re-approval of the head of the State on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured in an attack on a military convoy in the North Vaziristan Tribal Area.
A spokesperson of the army said that the bomb went off the road near the border with Afghanistan.
The father's ship is coming back.
The famous German group of the 1970s is playing again. The three members of the Harmonia group took again their electronic synthesizers at the Berlin concert.
The Revival will also include Live 1974, cut from the most successful band period.
They've been much more famous abroad.
The announced sensation then consists in performing three established masters, who at first look like they just enjoy dinner.
Everyone has boxes, cables, and especially buttons.
Threety-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snowy white shirt sits in the middle.
After his left, there's a seven-and-a-half-year-old Michael Roth, who's got a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Three-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who has concentratedly bowing over synthesizers, is from the viewers' point of view to the right.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, inconceivable, traditional composition will arise.
It seems that the masters of the musicians don't mind much.
Among the lovers of krautrock developed the revital band Harmonia a considerable start.
One thing worth noticeing here, the questions have shown that this name is part of a collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not so advanced that someone should miss this band for twenty-three years painfully.
But why can't Germany celebrate its still living legends from the '70s?
And especially when you have a musical style, mistakenly called "crautrock," in England and America, they value more than in their own country.
In 2003, when the former members of the Cano Group were awarded a prize of Echo for life's work, the hall was full of German poppy views.
In addition, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu, the wonder of the viewers no longer knew the borders.
Michael Rother later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concert, he sat with them on stage like their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worshiping abroad is one thing.
When we remember the Harmonia band, we overwhelm the memory, this trio existed for just two years, and even at that time it was not as powerful as others later added to them.
Moebius and Roedelius were already playing with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under a promising name, Cluster.
At first, they played in the cellar of the Schaubühne Berlin Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at the turntable company led by the church.
Rother briefly supported the Kraftwerk group, but won the reputation as guitarist for the Neu! band, which may have been the most radical German group at that time.
In 1973, Brother followed the musicians of the band Cluster to exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, ruins of the 16th century, lived as members of the community who fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius could still lobby as a nanny.
Rather, it was a life in such a spiral art being.
The name for given art is allegedly derived from the name of the singing congregation of Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in the dumpster.
A lot of it's been preserved by Harmonia.
The first album was called "De Luxe" and "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so peaceful and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Collecting the plants wasn't just self-recognition.
Now released the "Live 1974" CD was said to have been shot before a recordly small 50-member film at the Griessem concert.
In time, Brother wrote his wish that the members of Harmonie should be brought out and practiced on occasion.
For Roedlia and Moebia, it was a completely inappropriate request.
In 1975, the band announced its breakup.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere, and his future was in insurance for his "hot heart" album.
The band Cluster relived in the '80s, and since then it has been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His recording company Grönland took the goal of krautrock to take care of as an original German contribution to live music.
Kapela Neu! was considered Roedeli's solo work at that time.
In Berlin, the House of World Cultures will be a lifelong resurrection of Harmonia.
The performance at Woldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
Brit, Julian Cope, the old punk, and author of "Krautrock Sampler" will be present.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also attend.
This is what we've done with the overall spread of the influence of krautrock on future pop music.
The empty place for the famous group will be filled with Harmonia.
Brian En's greatness accompanied by the most right-wing sounds is raised in the hall: "The unique true music belongs to her future."
There are images on which the manufacturer is with Harmonia in the agricultural seat.
The creation of legend also contributes to the screening of other black and white photographs, on which there are sets of wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
Not by applying microphones to organ and drums to remove those yet unheard self-made tones from the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into the pod technology.
That doesn't change a congregation of world cultures.
Under Barbara Morgenstern's guidance, he whispers under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place he sings emphatically, "Aaaaa!"
Krautrock was always a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
Rather than blues we would find roots at music colleges (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever screams "'68!" isn't so far from the truth, but Harmonia won't even get out of peace now.
Even the most obvious of all, he's thinking very carefully about the scene.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This question of man will either prepare for nerves or give it to him in order to experience temporary moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't very cynical enough.
With the introduction of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But neither one of them is persuasive.
The front of the movies either puts too much emphasis on akcy and shooting, or they're too touching.
He's not even gonna stop an actor like Richard Gere in the Hunting Party.
Good news first: Criminals of Karadić and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but just there, in the mutilated background of the Bosen War, actor Richard Gere will live.
In recent years, we have lost this most beautiful man in the 1980s, not only because he has played in many beautiful, insignificant roles in the comfy women's films, but in connection with his press conferences forever on the topic of Buddhism, a person's desire for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter become a prey (Why must the names of the movies be so long and confused these days).
Gere gives magic performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what Gere could have become if fate and film business were not so merciful: a man who has had his best years long behind him, but like a memorial, he still retains a certain remarkable charm.
But despite this coffin, The Hunting Party together with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, who also enters the cinema this week, is a continuation of an endless series of failed films about the war in the Balkans.
With the video Mörderischer Frieden, we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who will save a Serbian girl from a Kossov sniper, though one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbians are not introduced as the cause of all evils, this TV film is changing too soon in shooting and action.
There's something like that left the movie Kobru 11, without the freeway, but with the war.
On The Hunting Party, you can study visually why the Balkans War has not yet been able to make a really good film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters, who are going to be "many" by a Serbian war criminal, could at a different time be led by another director and screenwriter (from here, Richard Shepard) might become a new "Apocalypse".
Both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go to the forest to perform something that the army is unable to do, but their journey will become a way to madness.
One reason for the failure of the movie The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the rotten and sentimental cynic introduced in the beginning.
On the contrary, the prejudice also prescribes a romantic affair with later murdering a bosen Muslim.
The Hunting Party can ultimately write down after reporters in the last five speeded minutes of the film will lead what NATO, CIA and all world criminals have failed in the past five years: to catch criminals and leave them with a fair revenge of the Bosen Muslims.
It is so against the logic of the film production that it would be worth turning to the International Court in the Hague.
But this film has a deeply human message.
This condemns that Karaduj and Mladić are still at large, and suspects Americans and French (here they are exceptionally uniform) that they do not spend themselves on pursuit of persecution on an intense basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are ever so similar, women will attack us the famous Brecht poem.
In it is a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the work table of the writer: "With compassion I look at the high vein on my forehead, noteing: "How strenuous it is to be evil."
In movies like The Hunting Party, they perform exactly as sudden heads, which but suggest how moving it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to just the subject of the war in the Balkans.
Recently, these newspapers say that all Hollywood films about Iraq were major failures.
One can be added to this: There has never been a good film about South Africa.
It's almost always true: When a star slides around a crisis area or passes through a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquete, the border of a break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCapre is created.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, they had to run decades before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler list.
Many films must probably be over - films that are considered to be classical Vietnamese works - "Lovec deer", "Apocalypse" or "The Lead Vests" - were not celebrated at all as master works.
But maybe today, when every mass murder at home appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
There is no such thing as scriptors, which is necessary to unquestionably retaliate good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "Great dictator" have become so good, because Lubitch and Chaplin have not yet known how terrible the Nazi regime has truly ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe she has to create a sarasticly measured artistic view of Lawrence Norfolk's novelist.
When he was asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprièr's Dictionary" and "Balcan War", he said: "The likeness is only that some things never change.
The greatcomists will always be very dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust brings criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics
The withdrawal of the mayor since the summer Olympic Games in Hamburg hit the sharp criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the arrangement of games by the water.
Von Beust, however, calls for realism in a dream guess.
The Chief Director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, said on Wednesday this decision 'in terms of business unfortunate'.
No other project has recently developed as much motivation as an Olympic idea in the city.
"Without this objective, it would not be possible to maintain this sporty political enthusiasm so high."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which is based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday at his earlier statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are at least 2028 unrealistic.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sport Union decides about the Olympic Chancellor," said von Beust, the WELT ONLINE newspaper.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Union will decide the Munich Candidacy for winter games in 2018.
"This reference to us means that we have no real chance with the 2028 timing."
Yet this dream is not over, he said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sport Union (HSB) named von Beust's statements regrettable.
It feels that Hamburg does not want to miss out on the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is still too soon to destroy the chance that we will mark our plans at this early stage as buried," said President HSB, Günter Ploss, Wednesday.
It would run counter to the statements of the Senate's Chief of Staff at the General German Higher Sport Union.
Von Beust here at Hamburg University in 2015 as a replacement for hosting Olympic games did not announce.
In the last week, the university sports union Hamburg was nominated for the city's candidate.
The fact of the SPD in the Chamber of Hamburg revealed that it wastes a valuable time, which could be used for building flats in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been braked by the Senate for years because he bet on the organisation of the Olympics and the construction of flats was ruled out," said the MPs of the SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the Klein Grasbrook SPD was still planning an olympiad with the fact that the whole area would later be used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously posted a "Olympian factor".
Taking up the summer Olympic Games in 2012 caused great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
But Hamburk failed in Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's boxes.
Whoever connects Sweden's expression and wooden boxes doesn't mean Andy Warhol, but on Ikeu.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes produced at present in Sweden cast on the list of Warhol's works of dark shadows.
Most of his on the list of ninety-four "Brillo boxers" of Stockholm are fakes.
Following the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago, expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo boxes" from 1968, the internal research of the Modern Museet Museum comes with the result which brought disappointments; six "Brillo boxes" dedicated to the gift of his former director Pontus Hultén in 1995 - as many of the other "Brillo boxes" of Stockholm, which are on the international art market in circulation.
The previous events are a confused, confusing chain of art and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painted wooden boxes, which were based on red-depleted paper boxes with a soap powder Brillo.
The exhibition of his works in Moderna Museet in 1968 demonstrated - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo boxes from the cartel. These were not (financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It's not art, it's their design, it's just exhibition pieces.
Warhol probably gave in 1968 also permission to make several wooden Brillo bedding in Sweden, but they are not exposed in Moderna Museet.
These witnesses are now talking about fifteen boxes, which were rightly incorporated into artistic and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warholovy Brillo Boxy" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them have been auctioned out on auctions for over $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 there was a production in Sweden and was exposed about a hundred boxes, which was then left to him by Warhol.
In fact, 105 Hulténové beden was produced in Malmö for the exhibition in St Petersburg only in 1990.
That's when Warhol was three years after he died.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator of Moderna Museet, examined except six Brillo boxes, which are owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from Swedish private collections, two of which were prepared in Sweden in 1968 and after their breakboards were painted with basic colour and scoured, were brushed with oil white color.
On the contrary, from the structure of the 1990 copies it appeared that the colour was applied directly to the surface of the strip board without the previous basic paint - it is acrylic and not about oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo boxes," said the director Moderna Museet, Lars Nitttve: "If Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York, Moderna Museet will have to classify six boxes from his exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies".
In July, the Authentication Board announced that these "hard accusations" raised in the matter of soap powder boxes will deal with them.
But the organization is still in unspeakable silence.
The rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers gave up at one hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
Commander of the rebels Antonio Trillanes, who mentioned the president's manipulation and corruption during elections, told the reporters at the hotel that bloodshed was denied responsibility.
Soldiers dedicated to the government had attacked earlier with the deployment of tear gas on the hotel.
A few hours ago, about two dozens of soldiers were standing in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were in court because of the frozen attempt to coup in 2003, among them was Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to escape with his about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, obviously crossed over to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government has closed the loyal unit around the selected hotel.
The president called for an emergency session of the safety booth.
Norberto Gonzales National Security Advisor sentenced soldiers.
"People are sick of it," said Triallnes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers, said that more troops will join the march in a short time.
