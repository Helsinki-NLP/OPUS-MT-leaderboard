Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, combined with 29 percent
According to the first preliminary results of Sunday’s early parliamentary elections in Austria, the crippling of the two parties to the current large coalition and significant strengthening of right populist parties has led to an early Parliamentary election in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly strong losses, where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the election leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Korean captain Jörg Haider, is about to make a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, however, the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the votes against the last elections of 2006 remains 5,5 percent of the votes.
ÖVP, which lost 25.6 percent of almost nine percent of the votes, was even worse.
These are the worst results of both these major parties in the Austrian post-war history, and especially among the people who created early elections, literally a catastrophic result.
Even at the beginning of July when ÖVP came out of the coalition, the people had a significant lead in the preferences before the SPÖ.
But the voters obviously punished them for letting the government fail.
In the first results, speculation about possible resignation of the President of the Party and the former Vice-Chair of Wilhelm Molterer began to occur.
The Observers believe that this might happen on Monday at the Bureau's extraordinary meeting.
Such developments would seem to facilitate the way towards an ever more likely starting point from the election outcome, i.e. to restore the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties, the free (FPÖ) received a preliminary 18 percent and 11 percent of the votes of BZÖ, but the social democrats also expressed concerns about the repetition of 1999, when the people had reached an agreement with the populists (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 from the BZÖ left the common government, which even triggered sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and foresees returning to Vienna to national policy.
The Green Party, which was slightly lost and fell among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place, has reached Parliament's Parliament's Parliament.
Apparently, none of the other parties survived the four percent threshold, and it did not come to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If there was no solution to the problem with Czech scientists who were accused in India from the illegal collection of bugs, there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
The Minister said this in New York after his meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjim.
"If this did not happen, then yes, then it would have occurred to a certain cooling process," said the meeting which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukhergi said after a hearing that he could hardly interfere with judicial matters.
However, he stated that, in the case of Petra Švácha, who was dismissed by the prosecution and punished by fine, the Central Government may treat the local government in Dardvillading, to whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kuček sentenced to three years in prison, according to Mukherji, it would be best to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for bail and for judgment to wait for freedom, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner was equally expressed during the negotiations.
"He advises appeal to a higher court, then he could be pardoned," said the chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way that the Czech party can enter the whole matter is to provide the convicted "competent legal support", said the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian party has already provided them such help.
"We are most interested in keeping with India the best relationships that have long tradition.
The Indians also recognise it," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as ČTK said, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a deep mistake to arrest and sue these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister avoided his promise to deal with things from the Indian side of the promise.
"I have had quite a lot of promises," he stated.
What the Czech judge for fighting for the seabed
They will join the wall electronic map on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are depicted.
But he doesn't care about the continent, but a little point lost in the blue ocean.
"The warning belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is large as the continent itself," says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team of UN Division staff on oceans and maritime law issues.
His boss, director of division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, hears the interpretation and complements sometimes.
He's gonna run a job show here and he's excited.
The sea bottom has so little known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ore and other mineral ingredients can be found here, but also unknown live organisms that carry the key to developing cancer medicine.
Bottom greater than land
The coastal states have now begun to apply for a new underwater territory inhement.
According to the UN Convention, they use their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Monte Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of so-called continental peat, which often covers up to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of that country.
According to the Convention, it is solely entitled to all sources of continental peat.
"Simplically speaking, the part of the seabed and its floor, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea, is the continental dome.
It lies beyond the coastline, often beyond the border of two hundred nautical miles called the exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental kalfu must be accompanied by an extensive scientific and technical document based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a number of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three last countries have succeeded so far," says Mikulka.
The World Radio recently recorded the success of Australia, which as the first substantially extended its underwater holding.
But New Zealand also acquired the size of the seabed which the commission assigned to him last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, which is about six times as large as the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
In the future, the profit they receive from using the seabed will be invaluable as they promise.
Other States shall submit their applications gradually.
They can do that until ten years after they ratified the Monte Bay Convention.
Where the continental beast ends, the area of the ocean's bottom begins with the Convention declared "the common heritage of mankind".
Here no state has an exclusive position.
The right of mining in this area shall be granted by the Convention established by the international institution.
"But the sea bottom is no Klondajk", says Director Mikulka in the post office, saying that his "unificational areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually anchored".
Czechs in Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other countries of the Eastern Block in the Joint Organisation "Interoceanmetal".
It was obtained in 1991 according to the Convention, as well as investors of several other states, the status of the so-called 'recognition investor'.
He has the authority to benefit from the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaiian islands and Kiribati.
The investor explored the area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is part of it, it's like a submarine replica of the Tatras.
"It can be used there on the surface with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetalic concrements containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," reports Indakshi Rajan.
Macedonian worker of the Robert Sandev division brings one such concretion to show.
Reminds you of a little potato or, in a little fantasy, a fairy-tale which, according to legend, brought Golem back.
The German Special Deployment Unit was in release of the hostages
The Egyptian government has requested a resolution of the crisis with hostages to help Germany - experts have arrived.
However, when the situation came to ruin, special units were ready to be put in place.
The public is gradually getting further details of the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Interior, German special forces participated indirectly.
According to the statements of the Ministry, both experts of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police, the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as experts on logistics from Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk).
According to another communication from the speakers of both ministers from Monday afternoon, however, German forces did not need to be because the kidnappers left their captives go and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
According to the Egyptian Government, the aid offered by Germany was adopted as support forces for the on-the-spot action.
"The lucky thing didn't happen," said one of the spokesmen of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
Attackers kidnapped a group of travelers composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptian guides on the south of Egypt.
After kidnapping in the desert area in the south of Egypt, they moved hostages in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the exemption or possible redemption.
Today, the rescue is already in order in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of the hostages is in the care of the German embassy.
He didn't give up on the details of release.
There is no information available in Berlin yet when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the letter "Bild" all five tourists should also have special forces to fly one of the Airbuss of the German Air Force and reach Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has mostly let the rescue package fall for the financial markets worth $700 billion.
Index Dow Jones fell through a lot.
With regard to 206 to 227 votes, the US Chamber of Representatives rejected the government rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges made by the American President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority in the programme to alleviate the chaos on financial markets.
Dramatic actions were desperate to criticize a package worth $700 billion yet to convince.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, appealed before the vote to express his consent, although, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It is hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that has never happened," he said.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or by 600 points.
The reason for the investor concerns was that a state rescue package could go down.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the index value came up to fall again after the notification of the failure of the package.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the House of Representatives and of the Senate should agree.
Travel agents record growing numbers of bookings
It seems winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, road trip reservations increased significantly over the next month, compared to the previous year, even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the appetite of the Germans remains undefeated.
For the winter season reservations, travel agents recorded an increase of 31 percent compared to the same period last year, as the German Tourist Union (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) stated in Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK market survey institute, increased number of bookings are available for autumn months as well.
The turnover was thus estimated at DRV for October compared to about 11 percent higher in 2007.
The basis for these results is the GfK numbers, which evaluates each month the booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and interpolates them to the overall market.
This result included booking of tours that took place by the end of August 2008.
Due to a weak dollar rate, mainly travel to the US is required, the DRV said.
There's about one-third of the reservation additions for these trips.
In addition, in Germany, there are particularly desirable targets for Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as domestic waters.
First of all, organised tours are on course, declared by the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising expenditure on energy and food, there are costs "for the customer, the savings are calculated than for an individually organised holiday".
Laepple explained that money can be saved by consumers, among other things, using discount rates in advance of booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so, compared to the previous year, the higher turnover will be again recorded - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made some journey decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Endlessly repeated poppy, beer from blunts and prominents in circles from well-known designers.
For the first time on a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, television moderator, and she wears a cut-out.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is made of secondand.
But one thing connects us: we are not yet three minutes on a beer meadow, and photographers and hbitily fill in my memory cards - that's flattering, I'm on Oktoberfest for the first time.
That's how you can make friends.
It seems my cheap cut has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and live north of a sausage equator, and so my feeling of comfort was rather limited.
But right after their arrival in Theresa, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone's wearing women's clothes or leather pants; nobody's looking despicable or embarrassingly concerned-- everything's completely normal.
Strange views of the banana stand in chocolate only licks my apron.
One Minichovan warns me that I have wrongly bound her: "On the left hand side you are free, in the middle of a virgin, in the right hand, in the back of the widow."
I'm going to have to put my stuff around the back of the left.
"All right," he says, and he laughs.
The others don't care so much with subtle flirting techniques, and they have simple flat hats with the inscription "It's a wire to get dressing!" and they stick around naked asses.
The young man with these flashing arches is called Bob, he's from England, and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time as well.
He looks "gorgeous", with an extended "oh."
That's what he tells me after he's taken off a really drunk muse.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage baskets.
So Bob is one of the feared 'Wildbies', as it is called in Bavaria in public, free urine to people.
Others don't have the luck to get rid of in this way.
Around 8:00 p.m., there's a field running around, where Oktoberfest's going, horribly paramedics, who have to take care of the poor drinks.
Medical professionals always appear in flocks - in four they carry a hidden stretch from tent to tent.
They work as much as most visitors drink meadows: empty there, full backward.
You can't see who's lying under the sail of this proluse coffin.
"It's the ones that can't go on," he calls me in response to my question one of the nurses and disappears in the crowd.
Police published the name of the victim of an accident
The name of a 13-year-old woman who died in the hospital after she was hit by a car in Essex.
An accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon was hit by Carole Paulson from that Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a man of 11 was detained for suspicion of carelessness.
He's already been released on police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began trying to enter the European Union, they longed to penetrate the European powers deeply into the Turkish prison.
On the east bank of Bospora, maybe only 20 steps in Asia, stand one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpaš's railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in a neorenassance style.
Then they'll tell you the tourist guide.
The building sits a circle at the end of the platform with towers on each corner of the line, on the sight of not knowing from any province German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's falling apart slowly.
But as soon as a man gets inside a caged treasure, he can no longer have any doubts about the size of the company whose most western gate the station was.
In August 1908 the German consortium Anatoly-Bagdad Corporation opened its station.
Germany, which became involved in the games of empire late, had the intention of its ambition to control the Middle East through this railway that was supposed to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond, which is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions broke down during World War I.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular units.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories created by frozen borders of the Cold War is gone
The British and colonial units proceeded from Egypt and forced the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And bad news also came for the station Hydarpaša.
In 1917, an explosion of the ammunition train destroyed its sophisticated roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, she has been gradually drowsy and history has been circling her.
However, today this gate to Anatolia and further to the east serves at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The Government Party of Justice and Development - ACP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
New policy is now being applied - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I sat on a night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was to meet with one of the top ACP experts on foreign policy, Turkish Member Suat Kikilioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a codecy driving along the tracks that reminded the ancient rhythms of the famous document Night Post, I arrived into the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for the secular state, who wants to turn my back on the Ottoman past.
However, with its well-known Islamic roots, the ACP is a shift in Turkish consensus.
In the west, she woke up suspicions, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the main state of the ACP, ultramodern stone and metal building, deliberately built in developing suburbs, surrounded by half-contained commercial homes and traders, where middle managers in business suits - men and women - meet to make early morning shops.
The Suat Kiniclioglu could be a high-risk policy from almost every other European political party.
Saka, tie, I'm sure Blackberry had one.
"The aim of the foreign policy of the party is to reintegrate Turkey into its nearest vicinity.
Cold war was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its castle.
Today he must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
Must've done both.
"But I'm sure the moment will come," I asked, "When will Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "didn't want that decision to happen."
After that, he stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here was saying: Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea’s surroundings are equally to the benefit of Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey aboard it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, drive on these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back to Hydarpaš station, after another extended night, I thought of those two German masters Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who watched this building build up a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be to find out that European ambitions in the Middle East can now be, from a substantial part, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting at the port for a ferry back across Bospo, I remembered that in those days Turkey called itself "the powerful man of Europe".
So it seems that at least at the time there was no doubt that the continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Rememberable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford musician leading since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (nekrologist, September 11th), he was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and choir.
As part of the periodic music plan, he founded a year for that of the excellent youth congregation Proteus.
He was supposed to be up to 21, but at the time Proteus sang in 1979, there were almost 30 of us -- we just refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape changer) represented the willingness and ability of the congregation to enter any music that was submitted to him - whether madrigals or Messiaen, alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young congregation was often stunning, always exciting and all thanks to the inspiration of the only man and enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanged throughout the time.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
Its tactical technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictator nor Mayan.
Wherever he was a musical standard, he always picked him up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor was to be matched to knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he was conducting Guildford's philharamines from 1962 to 1982.
In the last about 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed - and many times I have been inspired.
Tod Handley had this great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors, who, according to his word, simply "wrote one or two of the proven furnaces around the world."
We'll miss many of them.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary William Woodruff (25 September) claims that "In 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at the Houblon-Norman... and at the same time studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's comment from the author at Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 until 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time finished dissertation on the British rubber industry led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then released it as a publication of the British rubber industry in 1958.
He really spent 1950-51 in America as a researcher at the Houblon-Norman and summer of 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953, he definitely left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff crossed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resiny "Flamenco and Life" because its documentary black and white photos are amazing.
I was filled with simplicity and a strong charge, with which the viewers act, and consideration and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Honda will take second attack with his best-seller
In November, Honda will start selling the second generation Jazz model.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle has already had considerable space, now offers even more spacious interiors.
This includes improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, from an aesthetic point of view, the new Jazz lines are very similar to the previous model, many changes have occurred on this one-space vehicle.
For example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines should be mentioned.
Before examining the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the first generation has been placed.
Therefore, the first thing we're going to notice is that Honda needed a shorter period to cool down this model than other producers.
Although Jazz is a less known model in Europe, it became a phenomenon sale on other markets.
This is the case for Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
Just in Japan, nearly a million pieces have been sold since Honda Jazz was placed on the market.
The second market became an old continent with about half a million sold pieces in six years.
The Honda, however, aims to increase the sale of Jazz in its category.
Thus, while in 2007, this Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 pieces of Honda Jazz, in 2009 the estimates are 100 000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% on the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of Jazz since 2002, which means 6.7 % of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects the sale of 2,000 pieces throughout the year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
The management of the car thus de facto expects the end of the year with a total of 22,000 sold pieces, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and a 16% decrease.
Honda, despite this increase in sales, increased its share in the Spanish market to 1,8 %, compared to 1,6 % last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of his new model.
He is a Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid compact size with a length of 4.37 metres from which the Japanese company promises to sell around 200,000 units per year worldwide.
As far as markets are concerned, estimated by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States while the remaining percentage divides the old continent and Japan.
The opening of Honda Insight is expected in the first months of next year, once the public is presented in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions increased in the new Jazz.
Its length has increased to 3,9 metres (five centimeters more), a width of 1.69 meters (two centimetres more) and a axle distribution to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of 5 centimeters.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and is still 1.52 metres.
The enlargement of dimensions also increased internal space.
However, this benefit was achieved by using a new platform, but by placing the fuel tank in the middle of a vehicle already used for the previous Honda Jazz.
Also the volume of luggage space - which has a double bottom system - has increased to 399 litres, by 19 litres more than the volume of luggage space for the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in version 1.4, since the volume of luggage space at Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement in addition to external elements - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipment through the glass panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows the angle to be opened 80 degrees compared to 67 for the first Jazz model.
The second generation of Hondy Jazz is also the new engines.
At first this small model will be offered with two gasoline engines 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions, and provides an excellent improvement of the fuel system at the same time as a high torque in the full engine speed range.
The first 1,2 liter engine has 90 horsepower at 6000 turns with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 turns.
This engine - which had 5,3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 for the previous generation of Jazz 78 horses.
Compared to the previous engine, which in the previous generation reached 83 horses, will reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and an emission of 128 grams of CO2.
"A bee" prevents collisions
Progress in the development of technology that protects against accidents was inspired in nature this time, specifically in bees.
This Japanese company created a robot that takes for a bee flying pattern, so it prevents collisions.
This is Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
Engineers of the Center for Technical Progress of the Nissan Motor Co. Robot developed in cooperation with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technology Research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhira Doie, the general director of public relations for technology, research and brand development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four zones of the Nissan safety shield.
The robot has the task of strengthening the ability to prevent collisions on this brand's cars.
During the flight, each bee creates its own space of oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the composite bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, which enables bees to fly in their personal space without stopping.
Engineers designed what they called laser localizer (Laser Range Finder).
It records obstacles that are within a distance of 180 degrees before the BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends the signal to the onboard microprocessor, which immediately converts it to warning from collisions.
"When an obstacle is recorded, the robot will imitate the bee movement and immediately change direction by turning the wheel to the right or even bigger angle to prevent the collision.
The biggest difference compared to any existing system is the fact that all evasive maneuvers are absolutely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move upwards and downwards, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to a direction which enables it by turning its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and options like the bees.
In addition to acceleration and slowdown, Nissan also used the function of a rotation to prevent the robots from collisions.
"The regulation only needs to process information every few seconds and to preserve itself according to this data.
It does not require the preservation of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, which can work without interruption with just two dozen kB memory.
It may surprise you, but in memory, we don't even talk about the gig or the mega."
This is the first step in developing new technologies for immediate precipitation prevention, a technology in which Nissan predicts the use of serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to build a unit into the GPS satellite navigation system that would lead drivers to the goal and avoid obstacles on the road.
Enjoy your fear before you take your mortgage
It should be recognised that the U.S. Treasury, except that it has enough capital to distribute injections, does not lack even resourcefulness.
Faced in the face of a crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from taking a risk mortgage at a bank with a questionable solvency, it created a popular game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
Or "Hotel of Bad Credits"... or a confused hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionist look mortified to change once, twice and three times whether this is the right time to ask for credit.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is, the game contains useful information, even if not very detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a space for the public.
And what happens when the game is over?
A room of dreams appears inside the hotel.
At least something because I'd rather not say anything about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley's banking house reported that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank that would spend $9 billion to gain 21% of its capital.
A week after they revealed their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that the MUFG intends to buy 9,9 % of the current shares of Morgan Stanley at a unit price of 25,25 dollars, which represents a total return of three billion dollars.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the book value of securities on 31 August.
The MUFG bank invests another six billion dollars to obtain convertable securities that ensure it 10% of its income and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the operation would take place on the basis of an average single price of $29, i.e. 28% under the current rate.
Morgan Stanley's stock still lost 6.79% and got to $23.07 a dollar around 5:00 a.m. Greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity on the way to speed up Morgan Stanley's transition to the Statute of a Banking holding," explained John Mack, Managing Director of this American Group.
The new Statutes have been adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which will allow him to expand his activities, but at the same time it will be placed under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His merger with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest ace from Wall Street to take a much more careful approach than before.
The terms presented on Monday show, among other things, that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about 8.5 billion dollars.
"Just a week ago we thought," explained Tokiu Toshihide Mizuno, CEO of MUFG, "that our participation would consist exclusively of current shares.
However, given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to reduce the risk to a minimum and also to cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley's securities by 7 % less than their book value.
And the operation will result in a 20% reduction in the profit from the stock.
The agreement assumes that the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into normal shares for a year if the latter will be exchanged for a certain period at a price of 50 % above the exchange price, i.e. for approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures us that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the Group spokesperson refused to provide precise information on the strategic projects of both the new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should boast the Tier One payment ratio around 15%, i.e. one of the best in the sector.
Morgan made it clear that since the end of August, "cilely" reduced his balance.
The last weeks were demanding for the group, as its exchange rate fell by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payments associated with debt increased sharply.
These costs took the opposite development on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" from Wall Street's big investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's ransom, announced that she chose $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffet.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quitu.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the project by Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivijka Eva Morales and Ecuador Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday the third appointed to vote, followed by a model of his counterparts and friends, the proposal of the new Constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted in the 'yes' referendum.
"No" according to these results received 28 %, 7 % of the votes were invalid and 0.7 % of the votes were empty.
In order for the Constitution to be adopted, he had to obtain half the votes plus one.
Two surveys made in the east of electoral rooms and the calculation of non-governmental organisations predicted a clear victory of 'yes' on Sundays, setting them up in the range of 63% to 70%.
In fact, Rafael Correa, from Sunday night to Monday, demanded the victory of his proposal of the Constitution.
"The exhibition won the entire line," guaranteed and congratulated the Ecuadors in the headquarters of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quita.
He understands himself that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chinese counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote that, according to the observation mission of the OEA, took place peacefully concerned the text of 444 points of "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The Constitution’s proposal celebrates the power of the state over economics by reserving to him the "planning of development" of countries living mainly from the mining of oil by foreign companies and from the commissions sent by its migrants.
The proposal that Correa was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of the State, which will be able to implement two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the possibility to disintegrate the House.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, among other things, strengthens the principle of free health and education, which the President began to introduce in the country with 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, the ban on the presence of foreign troops will end the agreement between Washington and Quitem on the use of the Ecuador base as the starting point of America's drug operations.
19 hostages were released in Chad
The Egyptian squad attacked the hijacker of eleven tourists and their eight-member escorts who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held in the desert for ten days, were alive and transported to the capital of Egypt on Monday.
During the morning, the Egyptian squad freed them in Chad.
They arrived at about 15.30, apparently in good form, on board a special plane on the military base of al-Maza, closely adjacent to the international airport in Cairo.
They were immediately transported without having the opportunity to express themselves in the press on board a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, the marginal residence district of Cairo, in order to be subject to medical examinations.
"There's no ransom paid" and "no ransom was paid" said the Egyptian Minister of Turism Zohejr Garran on the way to the airport.
Since its occupation on 19 September during the safari in the vehicle with the drive of all four wheels at the foot of the Uanat mountain, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been dragged from one place to another 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romania - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border director of the Aegyptous Agency, safari organizers.
A head of Egyptian security forces indicated that 30 Special Forces, who approached the site on board two helicopters, ran into a steak during the night just before dawn.
"The shooting occurred, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source who wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of Egyptian special forces from the "blesk" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandes.
The chief of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is located, mentioned the role played by secret agents and ingredients of Italian special forces.
"We must recognise that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of people from our secret services, with special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied that ransom would be paid.
In the evening, the Sudanese army declared that during the patrol, a vehicle with a drive of all four wheels was stopped, on which the kidnappers were on board, and six killed, including the Chad Commander and two arrested.
The army claimed that they were connected to a group of rebels in Dárfúr, a movement for the liberation of Sudan - Unit (SLA-U) which immediately rejected the movement.
Letter - The majority of the department of culture
The debate on the financing of culture is filling the news pages with the titles of the fingertips and is the subject of an ongoing electoral campaign.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will rise up to launder poor sums that are provided by small museums, archives, archaeological dignitaries and national memorial sites that starve?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that they will forget their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebek, like Canada, we don't have laws that would actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying EUR three and a half million to restore China's mere castle in Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all the regional organizations, in cooperation.
In Québek, in the Federation of Québek's history, there are at least 40,000 volunteers joined together to 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy for the destruction of history, conservation of private archives and the conservation of archaeological remains for a few minors.
They are often these companies guarding the dogs of our monuments, which the dukes do not want to protest when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When are we finally gonna get the stories and monuments stands?
The Benelux Governments National Bank Fortis
The Benelux states will help the Belgian-Hungarian Bank of Fortis, the first to come into trouble due to the widespread effect of the US mortgage market crisis, the partial destabilisation: the three countries will support the monetary and insurance institute, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, amounting to EUR 11.2 billion.
This was agreed on this weekend at the highest level of Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis Bank is the first in the euro area, which has been spreading in waves for more than one year and the decisions made in this case could, in some respect, be considered as precedents.
In terms of a decision that was born on Sunday night, all three states will purchase almost half (49 percent) of the bank's assets.
The Bank will sell a part of its equity participation with certainty, in particular - insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis bank shares started to fall sharply last week, in the second half of the week there were serious signs of crisis in the constitution.
However, analysts agree that with their 85 000 employees, the bank is too big to let it be stolen.
The company's securities fell by 12 percent on Friday, at the 14-year minimum.
Since January, the stock value has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the business leaders it is unreal.
The company's conduct is, in fact, guilty of falling stock of Fortis of uncertainty on the overseas market by adopting an American package worth $700 billion.
The shares had risen slightly on Monday.
On Friday, a new Director-General, Filip Dierkx, was appointed to the Bank's forehead.
The pension institute was also looking for private buyers, but with more serious offers no one has signed up yet.
The Belgian Government has already announced that investors need not worry about their money.
There's still no panic between the bank's clients and the branches have been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also purchased several leasing companies.
The fox in the hen
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on data from people about buying medication, often reject the possibility of concluding insurance contracts with the applicant.
Data protection experts are concerned that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that binds the use of prescription data in any case to allow the person concerned.
He must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we trust the courier of the fox," quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of the program to monitor prescriptions.
Insurance companies shall be insured and the amounts paid in the case of insurance events dependent on the health status of the tenderers, and where the risk is assessed as too large, the insurance shall not even close them.
They had previously sent the medical exams concerned and only closed the contract when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: on the basis of the client's ID number from the drugstores, he easily finds out what drugs he's bought in the last year and a half, from which the program himself shows how he suffers from the disease and what his condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys a large number of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this indicates that he has practically uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts him in a category with a higher risk.
In circulation there are several versions of the program, some also determine the risk coefficient, so that insurance in addition to paperwork there are almost no work left, although there are minor difficulties.
The disadvantages include that some medicines can be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, used against migraines or hot flushes, but are also effective against depression.
These represent a significant risk-enhancing factor from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, while the first identified difficulties are not.
In order to request and process the data, a special company has been created that would require the patient's authorisation before it has been provided with the necessary information.
This is now forcing the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their past negligence.
Some companies have been processing laboratory tests recently, which are associated with data on treated drugs, making it possible to provide an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to the data, while monitoring their use will be increasingly complex.
There is a special health data protection law, but its effectiveness applies only to health services providers and insurance companies.
The draft law, which will give the authorities the power to control also the undertakings specialising in the provision of data, is ahead of Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: therefore, his programme has developed so that the transmission of data is linked to the express consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that the permit in question is hardly to be denied, otherwise the insurance companies will not enter into an agreement with it.
So hens are somewhat referenced to the fox's good will.
Global Marseille menu
The European Union and India will double trade turnover
Since the European Union and India are mutual leading trading partners, this topic has brought about, in addition to other, mostly global problems, also the agenda for the 9th meeting at the highest level.
The French-Indian summit will also take place today, which will mainly cover cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is a developing democratic power, which should be given a greater opportunity to speak to international affairs, but Member States have not yet found common denominators in support of the continuing membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was neither further discussed at yesterday's ninth summit, organised in Marseille.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy as current President of the Union, President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy, Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed that trade will double by five years, or that it will increase to over 100 billion euros.
Given that the exchange of goods increased from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, it is not an overly ambitious target.
From a legal point of view, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been incorporated into the future and the air.
By the end of 2009, India and the Union would like to sign an agreement on free trade.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be speeded up.
The aim is to balance balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is among the EU's partners to the ninth place.
Sumit also paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively terrorism, have condemned both sides in all its forms and called for the United Nations Conference to be converged quickly.
They also threatened to end the rounds of the Dauha trade negotiations, although both have a great share in its current failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, as it would like to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by 2020 by at least 20 percent.
This was also agreed by India, as would the fact that a global agreement would need to be concluded at the next year's climate conference and gas production that would reduce by 50 percent by 2050.
Both parties would also like to prevent increased food prices and support the convening of an international conference on the analysis of the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is now coming to the French capital, where he is about to close a trade on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that the mandate to build Indian nuclear reactors worth €20 billion will be obtained by the French company.
According to the Agency's reports, the Agreement should be valid for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Great participation of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred thousand titles for vision, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
The Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the inaugural ceremony in the Italian pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian resort (Putto Italia) on 264 square metres of exhibition areas.
There will be a press meeting in Room Struktur Buchmesse in the pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to show numbers, trends and perspectives as regards the status of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books in terms of total Italian production is still decreased, mainly due to literature for children and adults.
Found a plane called Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane was found, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the desert in Nevada.
Trots were discovered on one mountain plane at an altitude of three thousand meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area in Sieř Nevada, at the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no remains of man inside the plane.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, broke up the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we have a certainty that this is exactly what Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared" he said at one press conference.
So the sheriff made it clear that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
A 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Agency (Ntsb) announced that several hours after the trot recognition, an intelligence team was sent out, which finally identified the aircraft: it's precisely Bellanca 8kcab, missing from September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, to a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some Fossett's personal items were found in one couple near their dwelling in Mammoth Lakes.
This is two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Air Force Administration, cash and one jacket.
Fossett's search was interrupted month after his disappearance.
The Billionary got a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in the air balloon: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later, the world flew around on a plane without landing.
Its many records also include 15.445 metres high, over Andami, although with a copilot.
Glk, ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decision lines, wide surfaces with exact corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk of "compatible" Jeeps of the Star House, using which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring news to this sector.
Just thanks to its non-traditional processing will be unexpected and unorthodox and communication, which will accompany the launch of Suv Glk and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17th October.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of a new vehicle, will open an unofficial communication method also thanks to a futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The design of maxi posters, divided into three different phases, will dominate the major Milan business class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication starts with a performance of a car in a stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, if you look at the picture, you'll feel the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative Elumina technology8, the new Glk will be illuminated in various moments in all its little ones, in order to reassemble in a single image.
Mercedes undoubtedly tries to introduce something new to the stereotypical area of the road.
Will he be able to boost the interest of future customers in this way?
So we know who the Italian hooligans are.
Trivenet, they're risking Davo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls behind whom Italy is now ashamed? Are they part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following Nazionale azzurra for years and which has never been an excessive problem so far, after being told.
She never even met any opponent fans.
Group orientation is right.
Founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Terst and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-colored flags on which cities of origin appear: on Saturday night, they removed them from being recognised.
They're inspired by English fans.
They found real Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levsky.
Figc made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all in the name, which is easily controlled.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasle, no one who would be forbidden to visit the herds.
Four blue fans, who had earlier breaks from the stadium, were denied a ticket and forbidden a match.
Now Viminale is waiting for him to read the news that will come from the Bulgarian police, then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years to at least have been arrested or to those who were identified during the riot.
International Davo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in a nutshell, won't go up to one more stadium.
For luck.
However, there is now fear of emutation: that means that more than one hundred fifty will be added to them.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not justify those who are acting this way," confirms Viminal.
So, "in orderly open eyes, mainly due to a national game on Wednesday in Leč."
In Puglia right now, there's a small core of sub-personnels.
Tomorrow, Osservatorio, on Tuesday Casms, who can count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that is looking after problems in the stadiums.
In Bulgaria, this is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a very clean way), which is the director of the Viminal Osservatoria (a place previously Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a kevestor in Terst, where the heart of the subsidium of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilla says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the leader, but of course that the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - he adds Osservatory One – crimes are attributed to the country in which they have become.
So far, this group has remained within limits, now we will look carefully at what has happened and assess for the future.
But let us also talk about whining at Mameli's anthem: it's not even a crime, but if you allow it, it's rude...".
