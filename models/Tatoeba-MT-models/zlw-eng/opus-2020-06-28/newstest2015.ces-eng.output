Petr Čech: A last-minute transfer?
Everything is possible.
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big breakthrough.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr Čech, currently the replacement goalkeeper of Chelsea, but does not sit on the new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco and Paris.
He sits in a mixed NH Hotel, speaks to Czech journalists and is preparing with Czech representations at a game general with Americans and then also to a sharp start of qualification for the Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea’s brand, the Premier League prefers Thibaut Courtois in the new season, which, for the first time in the ten years of London’s club, got into the position of alternate.
A while ago, it was speculating that the Czechs might be interested in Real Madrid.
He at the start of the season lost the Spanish Superpohrer in combat with Atlétik and failed to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
Paris SG's interest was also investigated.
He had two reservations and two remises left in the French League season, and St. Etienne 5:0 was shot on Sunday.
The shoe club AS Monaco is more likely to push.
He's got a 1-2 balance in the league so far, and he broke up with Lille peacefully 1:1 on the weekend.
On tabloid English websites today, reports that the Czech people might want in Queens Park Rangers.
According to the English bookmakers, however, Bohemia's departure from Chelsea for the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet wrote on him course 4:1.
Peter, is it possible that during the rest of the few hours you'll change the dressing?
I don't count on it, but football is never 100%.
Maybe during the day, there's an offer that won't be denied.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know yet how such an offer that can't be denied looks.
It would have to be consistent with all the parties, first of all, Chelsea's position, whether or not the club could handle any offer.
Is it technically realistic to do such a cut when you are in Prague now?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract anywhere in the new location?
That's not what I've been thinking.
But there are plenty of players in this situation today, all of them at representation meetings, and I'm sure a lot of transitions will close today.
So somehow, it would be realistic.
How many clubs are on a planet that you could afford?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing off?
The situation when I didn't catch new seasons in the first three games is new to me after 15 years of careers.
However, there is no reason to panic, to pack up and leave somewhere.
I want this fight for Chelsea's goalkeeper's position and he's at the coach who picks out what decisions he'll make over the next few weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I take all the factors into account.
It is essential for me, of course, to play sports, but I look at it from a personal site, in which families' needs obviously belong.
Is it possible you'd catch another club in England?
That's a question I never thought I'd ever get into.
But all is possible in football.
I don't want to rule out anything.
I don't know the answer.

Police in Karrata arrested a 20-year-old man after a motorcycle chaser
The bike stopped after the zone with the maximum allowed speed of 70 km/h, it was about 125 km/h and drove into the bush to escape the police.

George Webster accused of rape in Nairn and Pitlochra hotels
A man will be put in court on charges of rape against women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, met with charges during a hearing at the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
It reportedly had 7 June 2013 in Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochra in Perthshire County rape woman.
According to Webster’s statement, Webster attacked her while she “was not conscious, asleep, and was unable to give her permission.”
Furthermore, Webster is being hunted for rape of other women at Golf View Hotel Nairn in Scotland on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of the trial at Edinburgh Supreme Court on 17 November.
Restoring a very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect the union as a civil law.
“As the trade unions work,” says Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, co-chaired by the Congress Committee.
Therefore, I am so proud that I, together with John Lewis' occasional rights, can introduce a law strengthening the position of employees.
This breakthrough legislation will give workers the same legal possibilities as to prevent discrimination in trade unions, such as other forms of discrimination - and will stop counter-disciplinary forces.
Adapting the labour law so as to allow all employees who face discrimination if they want to engage in trade unions to judge in a civilian court - and judging compensation or compensation - is a good and necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other law applicants are presenting is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the professional struggles that took place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once supported countries all over the world to adopt, extend and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember when the country one breath promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to gather.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja will be replaced by democracy.
They believed that employees and their trade unions were playing a role in the formation of a new Japan, involved in the language and openly acknowledged that “the right of employees to gather themselves, to negotiate collectively and to act as a guarantee.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers encouraged the Germans to create a constitution to ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler will be replaced by strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organize and promote in a new nation, and therefore they included clauses that openly say: “The right to create associations that ensure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to any individual and professional.
Arrangements that will restrict or seek damage from this right will be abolished. Measures leading to such a purpose are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission for Human Rights, which proposed a General Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a worldwide treaty, the applicants and Roosevelt Guards included in it that "everyone has the right to establish trade unions and access to them in the framework of the protection of their interests."
The Americans have accepted the basic bonus of human rights as working rights for generations.
When countries advised other countries how to create civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create employment unions - and their participation in collective negotiations with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are attacked in America, it is certainly necessary to return to the American idea that working people must have the right to organise themselves in a free and open society and promote themselves.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a big teacher.
Today everyone knows that the unions of power did not reduce the nation's power, but spread it.
They increased the standard of living millions of people, they created a market for industry and they brought them to an untapped level.
Those who attack the union forget these simple truths, but the history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and we shouldn't either.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human - and the extension of civil rights protection in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reinventing the ideals that raised America and made it a true promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law, which could have closed all the abortion clinics in Louisiana
Federal judge temporarily blocked the Luxembourg law on Sunday, which, according to lawyers, would probably close all five clinics carrying abortions in the state.
The regulation, signed by Luisian Governor Bobby Jindala in June, which is due to enter into force on 1 September, would require abortion doctors to have the right to accept a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The adoption of a judge means that doctors may, temporarily, continue to carry out legal abortions and must, in the meantime, maintain this authorisation.
"The proposing Party will be able to legally operate its activities and, in the meantime, will receive a permit," stands in the resolution of federal judge John de Gravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
The activists for the rights of abortion of resolutions, which is the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said that doctors will provide more time to obtain a permit.
"Today's decision assures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from the ferocious law to prepare them for health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Reproductive Rights Centre, who, on behalf of three of the five clinics, allowed the law to be blocked.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerns doctors from two clinics who were not among the prosecutors and also demand that this authorisation be granted.
Louisiana is among the eleven states who have approved similar laws, while the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures to be contrary.
The key parts of the Texas Act that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state blocked a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women's rights to abortion together with the Association of American midwifes and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association argue that the need to have this authorisation imposes requirements on doctors which are not necessary from a medical point of view.
The opponents of abortion claimed that measures were intended to protect women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed because of the measures.
The centres for reproductive rights indicated that there is only one abortion physician in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop miscarriages, this doctor would also, out of fear for his safety, cease to carry out the procedure, say the group.
The Louisiana authorities have indicated in their response that they would not punish doctors who execute abortions while waiting for a right application to be made.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer is more common in the country.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video with tribute to their late mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than their experiences in the city.
Researchers analysed medical records more than 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35% of years after diagnosis lived.
Ms Susan Jordan from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute indicated that women in rural and remote areas were about 20 percent higher likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
MALý STUDIE: New medications can slow lung and ovaries cancer
Women's researchers followed during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chances of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing illness and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in older women who have been diagnosed with cancer in advanced stages.
For women in rural and remote areas of the state, about 20 percent were more likely to die during the study than for women in urban areas.
Although the studies were not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors might be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"It is not possible to treat gynecooncologics who usually reside in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving medical services on a distance to overcome the barrier in the form of distances, the doctor suggested that it would help to strengthen transport services that will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are treated far from their families and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is regardless of the geographical location, which highlights the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer today will publish Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, young mother Elijah Neave was diagnosed with aggressive ovarian cancer in her 33 years.
Garden centres regret reducing homeowners' number
According to a study by HTA published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with extraordinary loss of owners of homes under 35 could lead to a "main age group of gardeners" reaching today's generation of young consumers, and the garden centres will come up with 10 million pounds per year.
According to the report, people who rent housing will spend on average 55% of the amount that people living in their lives will spend.
As additional factors threatening the sector, which earns an estimated £5 billion per year, the increase in the number of people living in very urban areas where there are no gardens, the promise of pavement instead of pre-gardes used as a parking area and the shrinking size of the garden.
In the Great London area, where the share of owned houses has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, the lowest costs for horticultural products in the UK are one household.
HTA and Royal Horticultural Society have stated that housing in a subsidium or lack of space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden counselor for RHS, said: “The tenants are very fond of growing plants in pots - when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the "gold age" of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of owners of houses and economic prosperity from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
Also for this year, he foretold a higher prowess due to the better weather that came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin, at the reunion of his youth organization, most of all reminding me of Hitler'sigend, preserved nuclear weapons, and in essence, made it clear to everyone that their views were stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
However, I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia is showing many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that's because they can control both nationalism and less valuable complexes can transform into imperialistic desires.
Time runs east, apparently, different from west.
While the Western world thought that the time of war over Europe was long gone, in the East they thought they had been overlooked long ago and needed to regain their international position.
Such mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the power of the Nazis was captured and followed by an explosion of nationalism similar to today's situation in Russia.
And then this totally congruent cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the destruction of uncomfortable political opponents, discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is certainly similar.
Vladimir Putin and most of the Russians are probably missing after Russia’s half of the world ruled, and the second part was shaking before them.
The Western politicians probably did this on their own, maybe few Vladimir was patting on their shoulders, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted, and they might have underestimated him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He made a order at home, he pretended he didn't even want to go anywhere, and he was nibbling at home.
Now he's decided to push back the lost position.
He'll start slowly, he's got time.
The leader's probably alive, so where he'd hurry.
She sent the Caucasus, now she's going to send the Ukrainians, then they're going to be the midgets from the Pobalts.
They've been pinching Russian bear for a long time.
I'm sure China will notice that, too, which somehow pops out, and certainly makes a long shot to the far east.
And those Germans are really upset about Vladimir, too, how they're doing right, and that's what I gave them at 45 and so on their ass.
Why don't we do one new Novorosija in Karlovy Vary?
That would be the base room, and there's a lot of ours, and as they print them, they'd already want to break some of them.
After all, our veterans will remember how they were in the Czechoslovakia.
For their prime minister, Gospodin Sobotka, is so soft, one can break like onions and eat the whole EU.
That would be the way they'd play to jump on the great Russia.
They need to be reminded of where they belong.
And as a wakeup call, we're going to use our pedigree who lives in their territory.
There's plenty of Russians everywhere, and when they say they're oppressing them, they just print them, and we don't leave them, we'll protect them.
And once again, the Russian will rule, for what's the other one's born to.
Europe is good only as a pretext that proud Ivan can dance with.
Turkey has called on the American diplomat for a spy report.
The Turkish Foreign Minister has called on the country’s top-ranking American diplomat to explain the American and British spy activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the US charge d'affaires and the Turkish state officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and Internet magazine The Intercept stated that according to documents provided by the former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority objective of US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan bagated the importance of the report and declared that all relevant states were watching each other.
According to Ankar, the German intelligence service has called for a more bitter response with the Turkish government.
Serie Game about thrones presented other tricks of the fourth row
Facers Games for thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.

Chief of Police in Magalup, corruption accused
The complainants presented on Friday the Office of the Maltese State Prosecutor's Office evidence of blackmail by police officers and state officials of the City Hall in the region of Calvia.
The police director in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after charges made by entrepreneurs and bar owners in an unfamiliar party quarter in Magalufu.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was accused of corruption by several entrepreneurs from Punta Ballen, a street in which most bars and night businesses in Magaluf are located.
According to Mallorca Dirio's Internet logbook, the complainants presented on Friday to the prosecutor of the Maltese Office for combating corruption evidence of blackmail by police officers and state officials in the region of Calvia.
Two other local police officers were arrested by a Spanish state police because of a connection to corruption charges, and together with Navarra, a judge will listen to them.
The Spanish national daily ABC quoted unsatisfyed owners of night-to-night companies, according to which public officials have serious impact on their business.
"It is no longer about making money, it is about survival," one of the entrepreneurs said in court.
Don't mess with our living.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf reached the main page of magazines around the world after a video of 18-year-old British tourists appeared on YouTube, which, during the tour, provided oral sex to 24 men.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to oversee drunks and rioters in the ranks of participants in holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of unfamiliar alcoholic tours to bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the event with the provision of oral sex occurred, was forced to close for a year and together with tour organizers after the bars of Carnage to pay a penalty of EUR 55 000 ($73 000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, who is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the fashion waves known as “balconing” in which people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony into the hotel swimming pool.
The first spring day recorded by rain and storms that had an impact on the airport of Adelaide
JARO brought the south of South Australia an ice surprise, came with a strong rain and sharp wind, which hit the airport in Adelaide seriously.
The next 5 mm of precipitation is expected to occur in the city until nine o'clock in the evening, and the next 6.6 mm falls during the night on Sunday.
The last rain was introduced together with a few short shifts connected with the storm and winds that began before 8 o’clock in the evening and in about 10 minutes brought nearly 4 mm of precipitation.
After a few early spring doses came in last week, the city’s temperatures decreased again to just 15,8 °C on Monday.
The storm weather is thought to have contributed to the late arrival of Virginia Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19:30, but it was affected by a change in the speed or direction of the wind and was forced to delay the landing.
The wind seasons at Adelaide airport at that time were about 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane had to drop off from the second landing and finally arrived at about 20:40.
The delay of the aircraft was subsequently caused by the delay of further flights including the Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
According to predictions, they reach no more than 16 °C on Tuesday temperatures in Adelaide, and one or two of them may occur.
Israel’s children return to school after the Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from the area near Gaza returned to the school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-bomb shelters, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas on their homes, rockets and minettes were attacked. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory recovers from battles.
The beginning of the school brought to the community on the south of Israel’s noteive attacks feelings of joy and excitement, but the signs of fighting are still visible.
In Ašdod, the city in the south of the country, the staff of the training that hit the rocket, removed the remains from the wall from the roofs and slowly expect children to return.
“We have a bit of a fear, but we look forward to otherwise,” said Ronit Bartová, an English teacher at the local school.
A lot of children in this area really need to go back to everyday routine.
Her 11 - year - old daughter Shani Bart said that “it's a little weird” to go to school all of a sudden.
"We've had a couple of hard times and we haven't even left the house," she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer its support to the residents.
Until the ceasefire last week war ended, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad stayed inside their homes or their homes and went to safer areas from Gaza to escape missiles and minettes.
Many inhabitants of Nachal Oz, a village near the border with Gaza, in which a shooting from the Palestinian minority killed a four-year-old boy, with a return of weight.
The Minister of Education said that some 12 families still haven't returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in alternate schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderotu, a city on the border with Gaza, which was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study urgently, and he added: “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas have agreed on a timeless peace last Tuesday.
While stopping the fires led to immediate termination of the fight, it did not address the key problems as a requirement for Hamas to end the Israeli-Egypt Block of Gaza and to reopen the airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmation of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two fallen soldiers in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questions these figures and estimates that at least half of the people killed were radical, although for these claims it has no clear evidence.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza radicals fired in combat against Israeli cities mainly in the south of 4 591 missiles and minettes.
The Israeli army again took over 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israel's attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people hid in the hundreds of UN schools that turned into a provison shelter.
Because of tens of thousands of people still in hiding rooms, school officials dropped last week's start of the school year due to ongoing combat.
"I hope they will soon open the school so that we can finish our education as well as the Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, 13 years old from school in Gaza.
I'm behind Vacha.
And Lafatu is suffering from temperature.
The Czech football representations met before Wednesday morning in Prague before Wednesday's preparatory match with the US and the subsequent initial match of Europe's championship against the Netherlands.
Of the thirty-member chests, there's a problem with the Spartan attacker David Laphat, who's suffering from temperature.
David isn't here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was about more players, and David still has some of those problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," said Coach Pavel Vrba to the journalists.
"If it's two or three days, or tomorrow it's gonna be fit, it's gonna be seen according to his medical condition our doctor decides," he said.
Other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some pain, but it is not such that they cannot train or participate in a match on Wednesday with the US," said Czech coach.
On Sunday night Vrba called as the last of the Spartan reserve player of Lukáš Vácha.
He admitted that this was not an easy decision to make, but others were also the mid-ores.
I've decided on the basis that Luke is a prospective player who's 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I stand for it," said Vrba to Vácha.
What about Shural?
Let's see what's going to happen with Lattata.
It is not excluded that, in the event of health problems, nominations might still change.
On the weekend with great performance, for example, the liberal Josef Šural, who gave the Hattrick.
Of course, there are players who have recently shown form.
Let's see how David Lafat is going to be doing.
In case he cannot be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot dominate any of the players who have taken an interest in the Czech League," Vrba said.
This afternoon it awaits the representation of training at Strahov, on Tuesday then classical pre-pass training before duel with the USA to Summer, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph.
Running with Americans is played Wednesday at 20:15, and the national team in it will seek the premiere victory under Vrbo.
In the previous three preparatory games, he played two draws and lost once.
The qualification battle against the Netherlands is then on September 9th from 20:45 p.m.
Pedestrians going to Italy on the Netherlands
Vrba likes to have more time for training unlike previous meetings.
It is an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them that we may not have had that much time before.
Now we will be able to concentrate on the best preparation for the Netherlands," Vrba praises himself.
The Netherlands will present itself before the game in Prague on Thursday in Italy and will personally watch the former temporary representation coach Josef Pesice.
He'll give us information from the game.
But it won't just be about him, we'll have a game shot and we'll discuss it.
We will see what changes will be made to the Netherlands," said Vrba to the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to very observed statistics, flat prices have increased most over the last seven years in winter.
According to the index value of flats in the Australian capital of the Republic of Poland Data CoreLogic Hedonic rose by 1.1% in August, the agency reported on Monday.
The increase led to a total increase in June, July and August at 4.2%, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase reached 10.9%, more than double per year until August 2013, but profit was not equally distributed in the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless said they were running Sydney and Melbourne on the market.
RP Data shows that the prices of apartments in Sydney increased by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne were 11.7%.
Among other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with an average price increase between five and six percent.
On the other hand, the scale was placed on Canberra, which was damaged by the State to reduce expenditure and where prices increased by only 1.4 % during the year.
Lawless said that when spring began, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"With regard to continued high auctions, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, it is likely that housing will increase over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry, my father never gave me a hug.
He never told me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father who died when he was Henry 19, who worked in the factory, they had a more colder relationship.
Henry tries comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father, and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melodies is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some awkward childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through the "survivor" therapy and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You never saw his face, but you heard his voice: “Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch croquet.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were adults - they went to a bar and discussed things like the shape of a glass with beer or beauty of a crash.
I never spoke to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner reading the paper.
Recently Henry visited Dudley's foundry, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked at what life had to be for him.
There's a lot more light today, but it's still dark, smoked, murky Labyrint, where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soak.
My dad always went into the tub, and he was just lying there, and then it was heard how she slowly started singing for herself because she was laughing at her foundry.
When I went by, I realized he'd been doing this for years to enjoy his family, and I started to appreciate it more.
Still, Henry had a childhood without a parent's love.
Dad didn't take anyone, he didn't say, "I like you."
When my mom was sick and dying, we started calling ourselves "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter, Billie, who is with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he was missing as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
They're still good friends with French that he was married to for 25 years.
Dawn's nice.
Why shouldn't Dawn be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of weight, and I started showing symptoms of diabetes, the doctor told me, "You must make radical changes."
So I started going to the big fitness center, and I also had to keep a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's really hard.
And tired.
Nobody wants to eat carrots themselves.
A change in the direction of taking Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short- haired beard.
After he got credit from criticizing him for his Othella, he dived into the theater.
She followed Comedia full of mistakes and August Wilson's plate.
It's a different experience than sitcoms and comedy that filled out his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him at the stage as he was parading someone, and he wrote about him in New Faces' talent competition.
His television career began in the mid - 1970 ’ s: “I’ve been the only black imitator/komik on TV.”
He learned behind the march.
In addition to having to notice the public, I had to learn from 1975 and 1985 how to make jokes work, be a star and perform on TV and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the right to stage production The Black and White Minstrel Show, a fun program in which the actors dressed as blacks, Henry eventually performed for five years with his comedy.
My family's been rude about it.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was “years and years appreciated by the main product of British television,” but was also a “grotesque black parodies”.
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced figures that also mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began broadcasting in 1984 and in the 1990s he was known as Chief Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
For the next decades, he took commercials, papers, television shows and roles in the movies, but after sending his series LennyHenry.tv to the BBC in 2008, he thought, "So what you're doing now, Len, it's a little bit like you're stuck in one place or getting a little off the road."
Next thing I know, there was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had an allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn a lot at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was worried about it.
Everyone on the show was interviewing Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, saying, "You should try it."
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words, and you'll see why Shakespeare is so fond of us all.
Henry presented for the document twenty lines of Othellov's final speech, and he was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gave me courage.
“It’s a serious thing to take it seriously, learn the text, find out about it.
So the testing was hard, and I read the game months and months before that.
And it was a success.
It seemed like they were waiting for trouble, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in the Comedia full of mistakes.
All of a sudden, I was in the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
One minute I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical flaw, and Henry felt instinctively that he needed to take responsibility for confiscated the audience.
"The guy in the head said to me, "Don't fix the computer, you have to entertain them now."
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I left the stage and said something about me: "Hm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve this for me.
"You're playing so stay in the role."
Henry in Plotech in Ghosts Theatre
Learn The Pilot's text was a challenge.
The panic is quite good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it is like God’s sign, which says: “This is what you should do.”
Of course, it says it with a voice.
So I'm staying with that.
I really like it.
I'm happy to be in service.
However, Henry's brain of a comet still remains - the whole time our conversation breaks the humorous performances when he enters and comes out of the role of the imitator.
I decided not to do stand-ups because having satisfaction from a room full of foreigners is a little dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into the dead end.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do live at the Apollo, but I don't enjoy it anymore.
I asked if she would ever organize some stand-up tour again.
I don't think I'd ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm having fun acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers state officials to shine on existing employees
Kenya began with a biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove from the government's payment list of non-employable employees.
According to the government declaration, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will cease to receive payment.
The government believes that thousands of people receive a salary even after they have left the state service.
After taking the Bureau in 2013, President Kenyatta promised to stop state administration corruption.
The audit carried out this year has shown that the state loses at least one million dollars ($700 000) per month on pay-outs of existing employees and on further abuse of official power.
The government is suspected that payments are still made to bank accounts even after the employee's death or after the employee left the administration, the BBC reporter from Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
In the next two weeks, all state officials must enter the identification centres where their data are biometrically recorded, are listed in the Government Declaration.
In addition, he says that anyone who fails to make an apology will be removed from the payment note.
"This measure will make a significant contribution to real public service employees and will also be used to justify payment certificates at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, secrets of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Tens of Turkish police arrested because of a "scrupulous" against the government
The local media reports that in Turkey a total of 33 police officers were arrested because of suspicion of “a conspiracy against the government”.
The police office hasn't commented on the case yet.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, between the detained 14 high officials.
Some of them were involved in the December investigation of corruption, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for the alleged organisation of a criminal gang and a telephone call.
The Turkish President, Recep Tayip Erdogan (at that time the Prime Minister) named their actions as part of the Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened up on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and Prime Minister Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On that occasion, he told the journalists that not all schools had opened up again, but that he was determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on September 1st.
Not all Ukraine has peace.
We must fight for peace.
All Ukraine, connected Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukov, a school teacher in Slavjansk, who is visiting Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain the knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the fact that children dress up their shirts, bring balloons and teachers to give flowers.
In Ron Fairhead, perhaps the BBC found a boss for a tough time.
He carries a cloud of fame from the banking world, media management and internal conclave of conservative parties.
She has experience from the front lines.
The career began at the consultant's Bain and Co, followed by Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world Pearsons.
She was the Executive Director of the Financial Times for seven years. She resigned when Pearson's senior parent had her younger colleague.
They say a million pounds were approaching her distance.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former director of BP when Cameron needed a private expert in Whitehall: she became a consultant to the government office.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the principal's work as a set of poisons.
Not only is the BBC extensive and complex entity in the centre of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns two directions: inside on the top of the hierarchy of its own management of the BBC, but also out in the public's voice at times of rest, when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that demands thorough reform.
Which headmaster would risk coming to a company composed of Chinese dynasty, decompose it, and by doing so, he'll prepare himself for a job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrinking its power, its finances, and how her status is revised.
With the expansion of the range of competition and new technologies questioning old security, the immediate negotiations on concession fees for the BBC are of great danger.
For a modest amount of 145.50 pounds per year, the British public buys a share in what is certainly the largest media business in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of the household and each cost only 40p a day.
Moreover, the BBC's popularity clearly rises: 53% of its supporters compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The use of BBC services has changed: I can see iPlayer on my mobile phone today and on the shows I have missed.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing principal - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims he did not approve the offensive tweet
Tweet from the official twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained an offensive picture of a democratic prosecutor who initiated Perry's criminal charges from abuse of power.
Tweet was later deleted and another was published on Perry's account, which he had since been distanced.
He left my account a tweet that wasn't authorized.
"I disagree with your tweet and I downloaded it," said the next post.
Perry's assistants did not respond to the questions immediately.
Although tweets have been sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is in fact responsible for its administration.
The previous tweet published an unly flattering, humorous picture of U.S. Attorney Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted in April 2013 for drunk driving.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay her funds for her office, which meant Perry, a possible candidate for president in the 2016 elections, brought this month before a grand jury in Austin.
The label said: “I don’t always drive three times the level of blood alcohol above the limit allowed... but when I do, I will sue Governor Perry for that he calls for me to be held responsible.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The authorities of Lehmberg did not conduct investigations against Perry.
Michael McCrum was responsible for him, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the charges a tactical political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has asked the judge who is looking after a case to reject the charges, because the use of law to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas history is anti-contest.
Perry interrupted paying $7.5 million from the state fund to defend the public interest department, which has its registered office in Travis County and is charging corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The refusal raised a formal complaint from a left-oriented group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it's even famous.
After he finished his fifth position in the committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign in 2012, Perry replied to speculation about the fact that he could already end his tweet with his own photo running near the lake, saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market returns "to normal"
One of London’s most prominent development companies warned that the housing market had returned to normal levels of activity in southeastern England.
Living in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices and increased credit bubbles concerns led by Bank of England in June to introduce mortgage limits.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and CEO of the region for demanding Berkeley clients, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned from the top point of the 2013 transaction to normal levels.” He adds that it provides a “stop-shop.”
The London housing market went well during the fall because buyers from abroad flooded the capital.
According to the data of the catastral office, 18.5% of the city's prizes reached its average of 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
The average private, affordable and student housing prices from Berkeley increased by about five last year and reached £423,000 at the end of April.
However, because of the strengthening libra, foreign buyers of London's real estate have not been so attractive - some of them have also threatened the introduction of new real estate taxes and the talk of the possible “seat tax” that politicians came to before the parliamentary elections of next May.
The London Real Estate Agency Foxtons warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter lending rules, will also slow down during the second half of the year the rate of growth of the real estate market and prices.
The new date of Bank of England showed a decline in the amount of mortgages approved in July on Monday, indicating that the housing market is calming down.
The Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has decreased on the basis that home prices have already begun to decrease, their forecast for the growth of London's prices for 2015 to 3%.
According to the real estate agency WA Ellis, in London’s most expensive districts such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington decreased each year by a quarter.
Nevertheless, the demand for housing in the capital for Berkeley was a blessing because it increased cash for the forward sale to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The question behind the right, well-looking housing in a good location remained the same and thus kept the forward sale. ”
In June, the company reported that from the beginning of the year until the end of April 3,742 properties, almost one third more than before the summit of the crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, yields by 18% to GBP 1.6 billion.
On Monday, prior to the Pidgley annual meeting, he said that the annual revenue of Berkeley was expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be £450 million.
The Berkeley stock stopped at the London Stock Exchange this afternoon at 23.96 pounds.
Hacker online posted photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th edition of the Academy Award.
The photos of Oscar Jennifer Lawrence's holders escaped online for a hacker who claimed to have “seznam” photos of another hundreds of beginning actresses.
The movie stars "Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrenc's photos were true and hacker criticized for "a obvious violation of privacy."
The authorities have already been contacted and will pursue anyone who stole photos of Jennifer Lawrence will publish.
Hacker photos that were originally published on the server for sharing pictures 4chan, reportedly obtained thanks to the mere in the system of the online storage Applu iCloud. A detailed list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes names of dozens of stars including Rihanny, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsteadová and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, but the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winstead also criticized the action on Twitter.
“I hope those of you who are looking at the pictures we had with our husband years ago in private homes are satisfied with each other” wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from cable TV series Nickolodeon “iCarly” and “Victorious”, said that the photos would be right. On Twitter she said: “This supposed naked photos are STVRH, people.”
It's better to cut it off in despair.
Buzzfeed announced Sunday night that the spokesperson of the pop stars Ariny Grande denied that the alleged photographs would be true.
An extraordinary demonstration from Howard Jacobson's praised new novel about love and the letter "J"
They split up, that's the best way to describe it, and then they split up as a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time, a woman told him that she was too serious, complicated, sharp, isolated and maybe a little pathetic.
And then she shakes his hands.
He's allowed it to happen.
He knew how to fuck, like a horse, yes.
The last victim of his ability was the beginning of a love plot, which more than usual promised to relieve him of lonely life’s boredom and perhaps also provide him with some satisfaction.
Ailin Solomons was a fragile beauty with wildly warm hair and a fleeting heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more light and hospitable than Port Reuben.
On the south came the older company, which Kevern believed to be her aunt, who inherited property in wet but wonderful valley called, occasionally, Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The tube was protested, the vans were dead spiders, the slimys signed on the windows like they thought they belonged to the place, the garden was grown and weed was like a giant catchphrase.
The house looked like a dork of children's stories, scary and charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the initial nomination list at Man Booker Prize 2014.
A longer choice will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailin were sitting on a stretching chair in a long grass and holding hands, enjoying an unexpected warm spring afternoon, currently loaded the public station, which the country had supplied with comforting music and comforting news, when in that way his view of her burnt crossover leg reminded the old song of a long forgotten black commie, whom his father had liked to listen to his founding roles.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggression, they didn't play radio songs like that anymore.
They weren't banned - nothing was really forbidden - they just didn't play.
They helped them get into the deutetuda as well as the word Deuetado.
The human taste has proved what would never be possible to rule and stand outside the law, as well as the people who choose books, memorabilia, in which poor people become rich, cooks and love novels, so in music they choose ballads.
Kavern took down the day and started playing the imaginary piano and the rough, comic voice sang serenad to Aillin's big feet.
Ailin didn't understand.
"It was the favorite song by jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to push the letter j before he could get out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him that he played the game with his father.
When you were talking about what started on j, you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth, it cost you the pennies.
It wasn't very funny at the time, and it wasn't funny anymore.
He just knew he was expecting it, that was all.
He must have explained what a jazz is.
Ailin never heard one.
Neither jazz, even though it wasn't directly built outside the law, they didn't play.
Improvization came out of style.
There was only room for one "if."
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where she was going to end up.
Same at humor.
His inconsistencies have gone to people's nerves.
And jazz was a humor expressed in songs.
Although he hasn't heard from Sammy Davis Junior for 10 years, Kevern jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
In view of her age, she couldn't remember the time when favorite singers weren't black.
No laws or pressures, either.
A slow society is one in which each part of it with gratitude - with the gratitude of those who have been a happy chance of investigation - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
The people of Afro-Caribian origin, with a temper and a constitution, threw for bouncing and athlete, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian Subcontinent, as if they were naturally gifted to electronics, took responsibility for no family being phoned.
The Poles that stayed were the plumbers, the Greeks, who stayed, wrong the dishes.
Those of the Persian Gulf states and Levant whose grandparents had not left the country quickly, while the TO, WHAT TO SALO, WHEN THEY Worried TO TO STALO, they feared that they would put them in the fire, actually feared that they would spend the fire next - they opened up a restaurant where they sold the seaweed and smoked water smokers, did not show up on themselves and did nothing to eat them slowly.
Everyone according to his talent.
Since she only listened to ballads, Ailnn could hardly understand how Kavern had just sang music.
Music was a sign of love.
"In fact, they're not dirty," Kevern said.
Maybe only for people with too much legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he liked this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden provided the illusions of security.
There could not be a word from the soundproofing leaves.
Ailin still didn't understand.
Why would your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was tired of having two fingers again in her presence.
She thought she was weird.
"She seemed funny to him," he said eventually.
She disbeliefed her head and blocked Kevern's view.
There was nothing else to see in the whole world but the confusion of her vermin.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said doubtful.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing to me.
She seemed really upset.
My legs are too big?
He looked again.
Not exactly the walkers.
Maybe a little ankles...
You're saying you hate me because I have too many fat ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you" but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are attracted to me," he tried.
I'm kind of sick.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to defy the cruelty that was lying in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel intentionally.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel to Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailin Solomons reds and rose from the deck, dropped off the radio and poured out the unstained wine.
No wine, so it couldn't be worth drinking.
She looked like she was shaking like a palm leaves in a storm.
“My twisted attraction is that you're an idiot,” she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for both her unloved words and for the fear she had in her eyes when she stood up against him.
She thought she was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about her life on a cold north-east where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that it was in bases like this.
They were covered by the same wide and icy ocean.
The same confusion of men, then, as SALAL, even more undisputed and duller than their forefathers, smugglers, and preachers, were foolishly blasphemed from the pub to the pub, ready to raise their hand on any woman who dared to refuse them or laugh at them.
Stupid?
If she doesn't pay attention, they'll show her their fists!
First of all, it became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antidote of the muddy love ballad that the radio was snoring - first it was bitten, then one murder.
Kever's view was too cultivative because mutilation itself was an act of violence.
Ailin Solomons, unverbably indicated him to leave.
He came out of his bedlined like an old man.
She felt tired herself, but the weight of his sorrow surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She looked at him leaving, like she was watching him from the window on the floor-- the man that caught up with what he did.
Adam leaving garden, thought.
Her heart was shut down because of him and all the men in general, no matter how few of them killed her.
The man turned away from her, the arms of the sainted, shamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she think she knew this look well, even though she couldn't remember one moment, until today, that she would ever see it again?
Ailin Solomons, alone again, looked at her legs.
About 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 20-year-old researchers working in Ofnow, the unstatutory public mood monitoring system, prepared a short article on the survival of light and medium-hard violence in areas of the country where it was mitigated or stopped directly, most were expected if enough money and energy were spent to be removed.
“A lot has been done, and much has yet to do,” she wrote, “to calm down the birth of the aggression of the people who fought in many battles, and most of them won, especially in the sad, hard accessible places of the country, where despite the tops of the church towers rising above the living fences in the breath of human kindness, rarely appeared.”
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower is, the lower the instincts.
The inhabitants rise above the sentimental ballads, devour unfortunate stories and claim to firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that the old brutality is held as hard as in urban aglomerates, but evidence also shows that at home, in the workplace, in the roads and even in sports fields there is new and offensive intolerance.
“You have a tendency to be too much of a manly style,” said her superior.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum has bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I feel I don't have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme replaced herself with her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
“I’m not asking because” said Rabinovitz, “that I should have something against atheists, lesbians, or feminists.
We don't have prejudice in this workplace.
We serve unaccepted societies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which is completely acceptable and commendable by itself, can sometimes distort judgment as you have shown it.
Clearly, you yourself are being referred to the Church - the things you call "circular" and "brutal" could also interpret others as expressions of natural power and energy.
He's still trying to figure out what happened yesterday, and he's preparing the country with her basic life force.
While Rabinovitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
He had a pink whitelighting set of recommendations that Ofnow had sent to the world for the last quarter or more.
Smile at the neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, chat, explain, agree, apologize.
To talk is better than to keep quiet, singing word is better than written, but there's nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," said Esme Nussbaum, when she was sure that her superior had ended, "and I no longer claim that she did not heal the morning as we pleaded that she had healed.
My concern is that if we are not brought to the attention of this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what STALO was going on, when TO STALO.
But this time, we won't be venting each other's anger and distrust.
Luther Rabinitz has joined the end of his fingers.
That was supposed to mean endless patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “when the steps that may have been taken and possibly not made by your grandparents are described as errors.
You're too far away from talking about ventilating your “deal” and“ distrust” into “others.”
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the presence, we are not talking about “us” and“ them.”
There was no "we" and there were no "they."
All we know is it was chaotic times.
“In which, if we are honest with each other,” Esme took courage, “no one is blameless.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not what happened happened happened happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add to that - we agree in this.
And just like there's no guilt to blame anyone, there's no need to fix things, even if the axle is appropriate and maybe.
But what is the past but to learn from it?
The past exists to forget her.
If there's anything I can add to this--
Luther Rabinowitz has removed the limbs of the fingers.
"Your report will be taken into account," he said and released it.
The day when she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcycle who ran into a sidewalk in a way that the passers described as "brutal and furious."
Coincidences happen.
The Army of the Lesoth Kingdom claims that no coup plans - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The military officers of the Lesoth Kingdom denied organizing a coup for the purpose of disfellowshipment of the government, claiming that they acted against police suspects from an attempt to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and says the army surrounded his official headquarters and occupied a government building in the capital of Masera.
After he said that he was threatened with death, the Prime Minister and his family went to the neighbouring Republic of South Africa.
The spokesperson of Major Ntle Ntoi said it wasn't really about the coup, but the response of the army to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police tried to arm.
“Today morning, the command of defense components of the Kingdom of Lesotho was acting after several news services were received, that there are several groups in the ranks of the police that are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to make themselves in the country of the wilderness," said the Voice of America.
The spokesperson of the South African government, Clayson Monyel, said military actions looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Even though no one has declared that government power has been dealt with by force, the action of the Lesoth defence files bears the signs of a state coup," he said.
The military leaders of the Lesoth Kingdom said that the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and that peace in the capital was quiet.
During Thaban's absence, Vice Prime Minister Mothetjo Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said that, in his opinion, the target of the attack is because of his efforts to combat corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended Parliament's session for internal disputes, there is tension in Lesotho.
He declared that despite the contrary, he did not undermine his dealings with the government.
Eurozone production is at 13 months minimum
According to a carefully monitored survey in August in the euro area, production growth slowed to 13 months minimum.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro area (PMI) from June 51.8 dropped in August to 50.7.
Numbers higher than 50 mean expansion.
New orders and factories have damaged the growing tension between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The numbers come from the quarterly meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
The market will want a clear plan from the bank, how to deal with the euro area's remote recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation to 0.3%.
There has been speculation that the ECB's Director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he is considering the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to the one that the United Kingdom and US joined during the financial crisis.
"Even though some growth is better than no growth, the brake effect that has an increasing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the manufacturer is increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, Chief Economic Market.
Germany’s manufacturing PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner, fell to 11 months’ minimum of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
The concern is about France, Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are also missing are not too soothing," Dobson said.
The slowdown of the industry is likely to bring oil into the fire to analysts expecting implementation of other monetary or tax stimuli.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57,3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist in IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing you can do about the production overview of shopping managers for August is to say that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: The producers in the euro area now have a very complex life, because the increasing geopolitical tension - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds ever more and more uncertainty to the difficult conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty of trade has clearly hit - especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially those costly.
He stated that, as “more likely,” it appears that the ECB will eventually have to make some form of quantitative release, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten years of hell from the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the horror of occupied school children still suffer
Ten years ago, the Chechen radicals at the Beslan School in southern Russia were held as a hostage of thousands of people
During the suffering that took place for three days, and which shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, of which more than half were children.
We went back to Beslan to search for some of the victims who died during the school's war.
Exactly ten years after the appalling establishment of the Beslan school, where 334 people died, including 186 children, warned the survivors of the heroes yesterday before the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, the fanatical terrorist children and parents murdered, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to tragedy has joined the east and west, which has led to negotiations and futures in this catastrophic disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to seek out some of the victims that died during the school’s war.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted the disaster, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will continue to live in them.
What's their greatest wish?
So that the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is over.
Girl trying to climb back into a destroyed school gym
She was captured by a leading Russian photographer, Dimitri Beliakov, just trying to climb back into a bombed school gym after she exploded a bomb.
The confused Aida desperately sought her mother Larisus, who is now 40 years old.
They were worried that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
“Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn’t," Aida said.
My feet were blood.
I got up and came back in to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several operations, she thought she had been fully healed, but yesterday she said: “The pain has returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another surgery.
I've got pieces of shell left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people as much as her doctors have helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it definitely didn’t destroy it," she said.
“This just happened to me, and I can't change that.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with our friends.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate killed Gapoev there.
As a kid, we played together, and we imagined how we would go to school together.
“ I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she didn't forget about captivity, but every year's memories go a little pale.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at the Internet, I look at my picture as I'm climbing through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from repeating itself.
A boy who escaped the rain of a bullet and believed his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (in Russia the children of school begin in seven years) and survived the three-day siege of the school in the embrace of their mother Tamara.
At the time of the seven - year - old, he said: “My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down and hold my hand.
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said, "Leave."
He was afraid she was dead, he ran, and on the way he saw a crying bat, he grabbed the baby's hand, and they ran through a shower.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: “Damir told me his mother was dead. ”
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was looking at freedom and lying in the hospital with her wounded foot, and on the other hand, she thought her son died.
After they were again, she said: “I cried for happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugs me.
Damir then flew to London (by the lost News of the World), where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie declared winner of Bernardo's Children.
"This horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that memories will fade.
I remember immediately after that, I threw all my gun to play.
But today, I can play computer games that are shot at, and I don't have a problem with it.
“ I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I was playing in the yard with, and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or killed.
We say they stayed at the gym.
For a trip to London, I remember well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted at the toy shop, and how I went with the convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine where he and his friends suffer from war.
The horrors come back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
“I feel so sorry for everyone who has to go through such a terrible thing” says Damir, who attended volunteer work in the monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to work with the police one day, and I hope they'll take me to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember that silence right after the attack, there were no kids out here screaming and running, and that quiet took months.
Lively, he remembers his journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the possibility of going to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell myself that even though it was ten years ago, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir's taste for borsch, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember how he played with waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them with a water gun and they ran and played with him.
And that's only been a month since the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed to the better in ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think there has been and will be killed even a lot of children.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something in the news they listen to when they get bored or when they're doing something else.
I know what those people are experiencing, what a terrible thing it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing's changed. People still want to kill each other. It's so sad.
Damir's grown up and he's a nice and quiet kid. He's not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates, and he's been going to the gym every now and then, and they're setting candles on fire.
When he was smaller, he had problems with it - I remember when he used to lie on the couch with his face turned off from us, and he used to lie there for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember that he fired all of his guns or other guns to play, and that Damir is 17 today, higher than me, nice, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe I've been sure for a few hours that he's dead and that I'll never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion, and I looked around, and I saw hell, there were pieces of human flesh lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember shouting “Damire, run, run!” but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life goes away from others.
Grigorij Ilyin, 17
A boy whose taken photo after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Comfort: The survivors of Beslan Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, to the right of Grigori today
When he was running for his life after the Chechnyan terrorist shot his classmates, he was in his bloody face sore.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the sinister in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists invaded the yard, so my boy stayed there three days alone," she remembered.
Not alone because we had relatives there, but they all died.
Only my Grigori survived.
As the date approaches, it's getting harder to think and talk about it.
It won't last one day for us to remember this tragedy.
We don't think it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some of the moments are still coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Always returning memories: Fotka Grigorii (left) was one of the most shocking pictures of the attack and was suspended as a statue (right)
I remember Grigori's day so excited about school, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
That he was alive, I knew when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of grigorie crying in San Marina.
Grigori doesn't like to see the picture, and we've got it hidden in the library at home.
I understand, but I also think that because of this picture, people around the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigori says: “It is important that this never happen again.
“I doubt we will ever learn the truth.
Similar tragedies are still under investigation, but no one will ever know the truth.
Now they're investigating the boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what the cause was?
This world is waiting for something too bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants war, how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To at least forget a little bit, he needs tens of years.
It had an effect on my health, I still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years, but it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why when it comes to September 1, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is history.
I won't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavaz.
I want to be a cardiac surgeon.
First, I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't do it for health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived even though he was held by a terrorist killer's feet.
A miracle: Gregorij Farniyev was held at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, yet he managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was captured in the gym sitting next to the bomb of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems like yesterday," said Gregorij, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injury he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I threw away.
Now I'm older and they say that kids with bad experiences can deal with better - I have to say, it's not true.
“In 2006 I went to a psychologist, and it was a bit better then, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - that was the first time and the last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'll never go again and please don't ask me to show you where I sit on that well-known picture.
Surviving: Gregorij Farniev today, on the laptop with his photos taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me to school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful with my knee that I hurt, but I'm already going normally.
But I still couldn't get in and study at the FBS Academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my file, including medical reports, and they told me it wasn't possible.
My next offense is the animals, so I joined the vet.
I finished it for the second year.
They learn how to treat all animals from "cats to cow".
He said: “I know that I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something that kids should know about, and not at all something they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “The pain will always be here.
He's inside getting worse with his anniversary coming up.
I'll attend the memorial ceremony.
I know Grigori won't go.
It's got to be even stronger for him because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me, but there are traces everywhere in Beslan.
It stays with us.
Gregorij is an adult today, but he carries on the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so unrighteous happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's done some surgery, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say he's out of 50%, but he can't get over it completely and he can't forget.
This terrible experience with us will always be.
During the attack, they killed a lot of our friends and neighbors, and that pain just makes it worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could have given me, but I'm hurt by losing people killed.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows that didn't get married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - war in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to be fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed yet.
If we could take all the rebels and throw them away as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who took to safety a special comando
Saved: Alyon Tskaev brings to the safe Russian special commander (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all.
In 2004, the world sung after a breath when a little Alyon carried out a Russian police officer in his arms.
The terrorists released her, however, in captivity in the gym, leaving her 30-year-old mother, Sister Kristina and Brother Makhar behind.
Makhar, who was three years old at that time, escaped Alyon’s mother and sister, however, died during the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan got remarried, and she and her new wife had a girl named Kristina named after her dead daughter.
The neighbors say that Alyona, which is now ten, does not remember the attack at all and has grown up to be a bright and happy girl.
A close friend said that “it’s a great happy family and Alyon and Makhar are great children.”
Ruslan's a great father, and he wants to keep the kids away from the memories that the tenth anniversary reminds.
You can understand why.

4 Tips how to get better photos and videos under water
If you are interested in taking pictures or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest options are a compact such as Nikon Coolix AW120 or an outdoor camera of the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at a family party of several cameras, they all cost less than 350 dollars.
No matter what equipment you use, but to achieve the best results, several rules apply.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure your batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Also set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a stage or shooting mode that optimises the exposure to a dark environment underwater.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are intended for up to 5 feet, another up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluating digital cameras in common and waterproof design.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them won't work.
Compact cameras have LCDs that will help you with the composition of photos, but the outdoors don't have it.
Even if you have LCD, under water it will be badly seen, and the composition of the shot will be unimaginable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a crackening mode that makes a series of images with slightly different exposure spread, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper subside of light, it's very long gone.
If possible, stick to the photo shoot in the pool, lake or sea near the level.
This will also allow you to catch more light on photos - the deeper you sink, the less you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That's a great advice if you take pictures on land, but under water, it's even more important because of the darker light.
It is particularly important if you film with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a firm and wide angle lens, which means that if you want to fill the cameras, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality power was able to change things even in such a vast organization as NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to reducing the pain and treatment of the sick.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was Officer MI6, who had to live with the consequences of torture that maimed him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and illness, treated patients in the vast majority are interested in something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel like I'm in my skin," wrote in May this year.
I felt powerless.
He was associated with flu symptoms, and he discovered that he was impatient and that Juliet's wife involved in remorse.
He noted: “I want everything to be done sooner than later.”
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually upset.
Something was wrong.
A colleague made him a chest X-ray.
One week earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-rays are up.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleural or pulmonary effusion.
Most cancers find it hard to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
Mesotheliom is different.
Almost in all cases is the cause of the exposure of asbestos - a building fiber material that has previously been referred to as “a miracle” but is now known to be fatally dangerous.
It wasn't hard for most of us to ignore mesothelius.
Asbestos, after all, belong to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry has entered into force.
Even at the time when asbestos was used, certain groups of people, such as isolation treasurers, builders, tersaers and shipowners came into close contact with it.
The toxin used in industry in another era is now difficult to appear as a reason for fear.
But there's no solitude.
As it turns out, the peak of mesothelioma epidemics today is high in Britain.
The number of deaths on mesothelioma is higher than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year are twice the number of car accidents.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma every year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in the UK
The reason why we only feel its effects now, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos species have been banned by law in 1999) is that it usually takes several decades to develop before mesotheliomas.
A disaster in the form of mesothelioma does not concern only veterans of the construction industry.
Asbesto was, and in many cases he is still present in the homes in which we live, in offices where we work, in schools where we learn and in shops where we shop.
The Mesothelim therefore does not respect social layer, wealth, occupation or age.
Privilegated basts from London's trading homes to public schools do not constitute shelter.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are the repository of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even cover his isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come in contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
“It is possible that many asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All students, sisters, doctors and doormen used corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question that he could partially answer.
"From the four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital and who later appeared to mesothelioma in the past five years," noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17th this year, he was 55 years old.
Live with this diagnosis is not normal for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
Disease is always fatal.
Now, then, we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us are going to suffer the same disease? ”
According to the previous British expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Pet's best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic takes place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die this way.
Asbestos mining in Quebec, Canada
When looking at files from the archives of the courts, which the disabled often turn to and require compensation, it shows how much the mesotheliomic disaster has spread.
For example, this June acknowledged the company Marks & Spencer that she was displaying asbestos Janice Allen from negligence.
For the chain she worked for nine years, from 1978 to1987, when she was looking at two stores in the clothing section - one of the places was the flag ship of the company, the shop on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today she has two children who are over 20.
“ Before it happened,” she says, “I've never heard of mesothelioma before,” she says, “I hardly knew anything about asbestos.
I never thought he might have been interested in me in anything.
There aren't many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, it's not asbestos one substance, it's a group of six minerals.
The name got him through his fibrosia structure, which gives him strength and abomination.
Of the six minerals three were used in the construction industry.
Most often today, in buildings it is possible to find chryzotil, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, baller seals and even in brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and WHO nevertheless regard it as a “great health risk” that can cause death.
However, the dangers are brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (crocydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos and experts claim that “there is convincing, but circumstantial evidence that it was the main cause of an unusually high mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom].”
Staff of Marsh & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in a flagship shop in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider himself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pet's work points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His studies say that ‘a substantial part of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was likely caused by exposure of asbestos in the environment’.
A significant part of this exposure is due to the "current use and enlargement" of buildings.
Seems like no one can be sure he's safe.
The report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government may not know that they are exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report stating that service elevators and pipelines under the parliamentary committees are contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be damaged by something as harmless as the “powerful flow of air”.
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case it may be the opposite of the truth.
Although Parliament's Directorate of Services insisted on the Westminster Palace to receive a “full medical certificate”, it is now counted on the need for one million pounds and a few years of work to be thoroughly looked into, modernized by electricity and removed asbestos, and that, after elections in 2015, Members will sit at the premises of Queen Elizabeth II, rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
In Goddard’s report, "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations."
There's no way to say whether this inconsistencies will cost lives.
All they can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to determine when the asbestos exposure occurred is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
As with Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) is suspected to have been exposed to asbestos at work in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos was shown,” he says, “but in my case, I can’t prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got hit with something like a cold.
He was 45, and he was just in the middle of surgery.
All of a sudden, I was shaking.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from a scourge, a rash around his lungs.
But just like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was mesothelia.
He finally spent a month at home.
He had chest X-rays removed from his lungs and introduced his chest catheter to remove the fluid that they sent to his analysis.
Still, they didn't determine the diagnosis.
His condition has slowly improved and returned to work.
But from time to time, his symptoms returned to him, often after he trained and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients with similar symptoms arrived at the operating room and subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott did not associate anything with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and got into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray images with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started to feel bad, he was in the space between the thoracic cavity extract and the lung sent a probe equipped with a camera.
I'm an optimist.
I have a tendency not to take much," he says.
To be honest, I didn't really worry about it.
But Rachel, my wife, she was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year: “They told me it was mesothelious. ”
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott started dating his sisters from the Macmillan charity organization and advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipeline," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to manifest disease.
So Mesothelioma is now beginning to concern younger people who are not at risk.
The most dangerous pipes heat-insulated asbestos were found in hospitals in the basement, so it was unlikely that patients would be in danger.
However, members of staff who had been crossing the basement corridors between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (such as Graham Abbott) completely came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it appears now, several decades after the war, there were a place where patients could save their lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is removed to this day.
The students had put Bunsen's kahan on asbestos pads.
And it's not just about the hospital.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its excellent insulation and non-flammable properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people of asbestos were exposed at school.
Somewhere in countless classes, students built Bunsen's kahan on the asbestos mat.
Web pages dealing with asbestos in schools have been developed.
The harmless things such as floor tiles or roofs of shelters on tools in our homes usually contained asbestos.
“One of the industrial poisons built up in a large amount of houses,” notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer representing Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma was able to remember in the 1970s when the garden house was hit.
So be careful how you're hurting a garden house.
Knowing that the disease is unhealthy, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
“It takes a while to figure out,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I found out I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in the O.R. for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna make another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was to move from a doctor to a patient position.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he also remembers how he felt confused about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all this," he says.
“ I asked my doctor: “How much time do I have? ”
I was told 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I'm not going to live another Christmas.
That's what it is."
Mesoteliom is particularly destructive because the mechanism itself that keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills us.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure of asbestos.
Asbestos make small fibres.
When asbestos is broken and the fibers breathe, they can settle in the pleural, lung remover.
Asbestos fibers irritating and may induce cell mutations.
"The problem is a breathed asbestos fiber in the shape of a needle," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiurg who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is paradoxically leading centre for mesothelioma treatment.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos most likely during hospital practice.
Asbestos needles get into the tissue of the lungs, says Treasure, and “a single breathing is pushed to the edge of where the lining is located.
It's invasive from the very beginning.
For mesothelioma, the common treatment options used in other types of cancer do not take so much away.
It is discussed, for example, the effectiveness of the operation.
Some say she'd be worth a shot.
Treasure doesn't agree.
"You can't remove the scourge," he says.
You don't get scalpel around her.
The cancer “too does not respond to chemotherapy” which “has some effect” but does not cure.
“Someone who survives lung cancer over time” says Treasure.
But eventually they'll all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
Following the findings of mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, became individual support and advisor to the same disabled people.
When they called, he introduced himself: “Good morning, you called at the cancer center.”
“He was very positive,” says Abbott.
His illness was diagnosed four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning of Abbott, they offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last for four months, and would probably extend his life by only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson “showing things in a more optimistic light. ”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Ladzukski from the department of thoracic surgery at Guy's Hospital Hospital.
“I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called there and they looked at me," acknowledges Graham.
A normal patient would have to get a gag, and they would have to approve his remuneration.
In order to get to the best available treatment, money is key to patients with mesothelioma.
But when different treatments eventually fail, many patients face other financial concerns - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and want to compensate.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan with Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful,” says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even very small amounts could constitute a health risk.
And here we meet the negligence of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled, but according to Morgan, this was not a “full settlement” because Lawson could not prove that mesothelioma was the result of an exhibition of asbestos in Guy's Hospital.
After the investigation of the case, however, spokesperson Guy's Hospital confirmed that “the asbestos in the incriminated basement was removed in the 1990s.”
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
Inclusion of exposure to fatal asbestos to one company or place of work - usually tens of years after this happened - proved to be a huge problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
A lot of former workplaces have changed owners or gone missing.
Insurance records are lost.
And those who defend themselves now have time on their side, which is certainly not their prosecutors.
In response to this fact, important new legislation has been approved this year, thanks to which patients with mesothelioma are easier to manage even if their former employer cannot be supervised.
The law has created a 350 million financial reserve that is being paid to the insurance companies and which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, which can prove that they were exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80 % of the amount which the court would normally grant them as compensation - approximately 120,000 pounds.
Each year 300 successful applications are expected.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, thinks that £35 million is "good work".
"This is an agreement written by insurance companies," she says and points out that the sum is quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if it hadn't hit the time and people with mesothelioma would have been able to catch up to the former employers and normally sue them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps.”
But Penning and Morgan admit that, due to seven deaths, fast action was necessary each year.
"People need too much help now," Penning said last December during the second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Ladzunski for 19 months.
After the initial consultation, he recommended Lang-Ladzinski's operation, which, unlike Tom Treasura thought had a positive effect.
Following surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy was followed by three-fold treatment, in which Lang-Ladzinski may boast a five-year survival rate up to 40% of patients.
Abbott's made it stronger.
"It is, of course, not the most important thing," said Abbott.
You see it all the time in the patients.
There's something that's driving you.
If you give up, your condition may get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott took the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he finished the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Surveillance showed no signs of illness.
I went to another inspection in March [2014].
I had some stains in my chest.
My 50th birthday just came up.
It doesn't risk life.
He's taking it.
Abbott has re-entered six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no traces of tumor in his body.
But it's a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security, when I die, or to show my wife how the boiler alarm works.
When you hear the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I'd never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and then we started calling a lot of people.
Ellie was more held up.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients must face such conversations.
However, in mesothelioma patients such conversations are not lightened by hope or merely by the chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and finally brought Stephen Jay Gould) unfavorable certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “the unlimited lives do not threaten.”

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - protesters promise revenge
In spite of the quantitative discussion on democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for elections in 2017.
It is likely that this step will trigger long promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists have begun to organize and get ready only a few hours after this announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We were not surprised, but we were delighted," said Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And clearly we have something to do with the authoritative regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Fei said that allowing public nominations in the elections to lead Hong Kong would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when China has returned to the administration of Hong Kong, Beijing promises that, from the beginning of 2017, residents will be able to vote in force.
Chinese leaders have presented Sunday decisions as a democratic breakthrough, because Hong Kong allows direct voting, but it also makes it clear that Chinese leaders hold firm in the hands of the nomination process of the committee, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be permitted.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded some of the biggest and most recent protests in Hong Kong in several years.
For the most part, pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are the occupation movement of the Centre with love and peace, whose organizers threatened by the closure of the financial district if Beijing does not grant them a universal voting right.
On Sunday night, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the occupation movement in the rain gathered in front of Hong Kong government.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement would enter a new phase of civil disobedience and that there would be a wave of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online declaration, the organizers said that the movement “was considered the occupation of the Centre only as the last step in the event that all possibilities of dialogue were exhausted and there would be no other choice.
We must regret to announce that today all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the establishment of the Centre is inevitable.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcements all day, and on Sunday, they have strengthened the protection of government headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
Inciting anxiety is a sign that many people in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of the city.
The consumption of landmen increases competition in the fields of products and services.
There is also concern that values such as democracy and freedom of words are being reduced by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the occupation movement of the Central and say that their demonstrations threaten the trade - the rescue boat of Hong Kong.
“The protest he talks about could cause much more economic damage according to how many people participate and for how long” says Regina Ip, who criticises the movement in the long term.
We don't want Hong Kong to get out of control.
Such perception could damage the investment.
China’s state media has also come up with reports that Hong Kong’s democratic activists draw as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights with 780 000 participants - more than five voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands attended one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
A electoral agitary?
The string in the Jihlava bears the name according to the political movement
The little kick plays in Vysočina in the regional city of Vysočina about 1 600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition is now called Together for Jihlava League.
The name was given by one movement that goes to October's municipal elections.
Moreover, ten for his candidate is the boss of a small kick in Jan Mrák's Jihlava.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem," said Mrák.
The lawyers of the South Town Hall have already addressed the situation around the first league of small copies and recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
A small copy last year, according to the city website, received about a million crowns.
This year, it's hundreds of thousands.
In legal terms, the procedure is not against the law or the Magistrate directives.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Authority to adjust the rules for the allocation of grants and subsidies," said Radek Tulis spokesperson.
The Kerpat grant from the city and, at the same time, express as a little copy of support in elections to one political party, it may not be possible anymore.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come to the Susko "big" football.
That perhaps the CzechSSD was created by the Regional Review, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And the class and the like?
I wouldn't be for it.
On the contrary, I would like the company's sponsors to turn to us," said Miroslav Vrzáček, Chairman of the Czech Football Union.
The leader of small football does not let other parties and move into the name of the league
According to players small kicks, this sport in Jihlava deserves its own site with six courses, dressings and social facilities.
"For example, the field on Stoupa is not ours, we are there on rent," pointed out Ondřej Lapeš from Starlet Jihlava.
The most suitable location would be Czech mill.
However, there will be, for example, a pointless place for skaters, which is about 50 in Jihlava," said Mrák.
Primator Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that a small kicker uses a field with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupách, which are in the city's property.
We want to build a playground that has maximum use.
We are going to modernize or build sports fields in schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think a huge progress has been made for a little kick in recent years," he added.
Another political party in the names of leagues, according to Jana Mraków, will not appear.
We have limitations.
If one of the fields enters our partnership, we do not go there anymore," he explained.
"Political movement in the name of the league, I consider that an unfortunate step at least," said the member of the Council Committee on Sport Karel Voldan.
"But let the voters assess whether Mr. Mráka uses the group of the Little Kicked Jihlava and the City Subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition enters university life - freshmen can fly jets
We are pleased that we can answer the first luxury travel service for students in Britain by launching the demand.
For the purpose of leaving the best impression on arrival at the University, the company also offers transportation options including private jets or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also declared that the service had its own security side.
Service is the ideal option for students who otherwise would have to go through the whole state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to making sure with our VIF (very importer fresher - a very important freshman) variants this year students arrive at the University with a minimum of nervousness and maximum luxury.
The company spokesperson said that since the services have only started, they have no reservations yet, but he added: “Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that although students pay 9 000 pounds per year, it expects the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, students are different as regards expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticized the service as inviolable.
Megan Dunn, the vice president of the Union for higher education, noted: “For most students, such a project is impossible.
A lot of students who come to the university this month need to be able to cope with the financial crisis before thousands of pounds are fired for something as simple as coming to the railway, because the financial support available in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising costs of basic needs.
Feminists face racism and police behaviour after the events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson killed an unarmed young man in Missouri.
The present ones waiting for a funeral with their hands chanted: “Trust up, do not shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, due to the shooting of an unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a shift in the Internet discussion of White Feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, White Feminists prefer sex against race.
With increasing tension in the Midwest, which attracted attention to the national press, Perézová noticed that the white woman’s reaction was 100% concentrated on race.
In comparison to the reactions of black people soon after the shooting of August 9th, personal articles with titles such as “the thought of a white girl over Ferguson” or “Feminism is not just about oppressing women” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this represents an important change.
"I think that there are not many people in a feminist movement who would talk about race and privileges at such level," she said.
People felt that they had to express themselves to what happened.
For the crisis that we are facing, it is characteristic because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially won that they had to draw attention to it.
According to Professor of English at Ohio Korithy Mitchell University, Ferguson brought to light the problems that African-Americans have to face every day, and which are not seen as "woman questions" in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish funny stories from life with my partner on Facebook, and it will get 150 foxes from people around the world," Mitchell said.
If I write something about the fact that the coloreds are trapped in their own country, it's silently deafening.
"How is it possible for a woman to publicly talk about relationships, but not security in public space?" she asked.
For black people like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issue of race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no difference between race and gender phytomy issues.
According to her, the black people could not have enjoyed luxury clearly divided the following problems: each day they live in this mixed reality.
Although white women today raise the question of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, professor of female question and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black people were lynched and the reason was almost in all cases the rape of whites," Hattery said.
You needed white man's cooperation to justify lynching.
According to Hattery's split between the whites and the blacks, when warriors for electoral law like Susan B. Anthony examined the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or black can have electoral rights.
"They decided to bet cards to voting rights for women and to focus on black people later," Hatery explained.
If we realize this, we'll get an important look at why the colored women don't believe white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black people protect their husbands and children.
Even after women in 1920 gained electoral right, it took ten years to organize themselves against lynching in the Association of Southern Women for the prevention of lynching.
The group was 40 years old after the blacks first told for help.
According to Mitchell, the reaction of white feminists to questions raised in Ferguson - the question of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "convince" questions that black people had with generations.
“It wouldn’t be great if activists on these premises [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraceptives?” Mitchell said.
The second wave of feminists who have done careers fighting for reproductive law and access to birth control are now finding out what that means.
A significant feminist activists like Gloria Stein took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot by Facebook, where they published Rebecca Carroll's column from Guardian, which demanded white Americans to protest against racism more effectively.
"I hope that women who have different but still similar reasons for understanding the dangers of society - and the views on race, which differ significantly in public opinion surveys - will seek change," said Steinem.
Although Steinem is founded by interseptial feminism, which includes both race and gender issues, her comments on the question of race in America by some people math.
From American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, the author of the book “Who stole feminism” said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are “manier than their sisters”, but notes Stein's parties to Ferguson face the criticism that she had already caused.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program My Brothers Keeper, which was to help vulnerable young black people and Hispanics, it caused many feminists, including Gloria Stein's angry reaction.
The relationship between police and the Black Community is not the only problem that comes first to the interests of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police stopped this year in the South West almost 63 000 young people without escorting, the issue of reforming immigration laws has once again arisen - this time as a female question.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairing President of We Belong Together, a women-mobilising organization for the reform of immigration laws, said that in order to allow the question to be presented as essential to women, the only thing she had to do was to share the stories of immigrants.
“He speaks for himself,” says Mercado.
Given that most employment permits are granted to men, women who come with them will find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories are loud in women's organizations," she said.
The housing press in Ipswich for sale
The real estate office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when she published it, rested on it in the living room of the pig.
One-room separate cottage, which is for sale for £120,000, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The photos included a picture of the living room, in which he rests with his head on the couch of the pig.
The Connells Real Estate Office said that the press on the photograph is the owner's pet.
"The plant was mistaken, and therefore was removed," said the spokesperson.
In real estate information, the real estate agency Connells described the former prayer as "a single-room house."
Although the office has removed the photo from its website, promotion material is still emerging.
The sale of the house raised interest in social networks, where some asked whether the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey has a city in the Southwest of a fresh millionaire.
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
There's a search for a new millionaire in the south-east of Perth, one lucky guy taking home $1 million from Saturday's lottery haulage.
The traffic in Harvey had been in luck twice in five years, the last time in November 2009 was one million dollars.
But the great winner has to sign in.
The owner of Steve Forward said that the entire town in the southwest of Perth was about to win.
It's a major topic, and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was on touch.
Eight winners in West Australia last month split one win, which ended several happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires and only a few weeks earlier, he won the incredible $7.5 million in Belmont.
The winning couple were betting for 20 years and said that the win would allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
Harvey's million dollar player is the 59th winner of the Western Australia lottery for the year, totaling $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn's trains aren't going out tonight.
Machine leaders want higher wages
In a press release, the GDL marked a protest at a warning strike, for which it chose time outside of the traffic hour.
The chosen time strike takes a GDL look at many people who return to the railroad during the first working day of the weekend.
At the same time we also think of people arriving during work during the day," said the union on Monday morning in the press release for a strike.
"Our first strike should hit mainly freight, less passengers," he added.
The DB has not yet published an official response to the announcement of the strike.
It is not even clear how protest events affect international rail links, including Czech Republic.
The trade unions require a five percent increase in machinery wages and a two-hour work time reduction per week.
Currently, the average salary of train leaders is between EUR 36 000 and 46 000 (EUR 998 000 and CZK 1.27 million) annually.
The engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to proceed to wage growth while shortening the working time.
They stress that wage assessments of train drivers must be developed as well as of the other railway staff in which DB does not count by shortening the working week.
It threatened Krest's car to burn.
That's why Barum rallye ended up
What exactly happened?
It was a defect in the material.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think that something like this could happen.
There was no exhaust to quickly repair and continue at a slower pace to the service, where the mechanics would change it?
If we went straight there, yes.
But we've been waiting for another two years, and we couldn't do that.
It has a high temperature, and the risk of the car burning was high.
I can't afford that.
You did five speed tests at full speed.
How did you feel about them?
Very good.
I felt young.
We were fast, and I didn't go over the wint.
Everything was caused by drinking the car for more than six months, to be on some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You drove him off so you could actually think about winning.
I prepared the car myself and myself so that we really had a win.
The job didn't come home.
On the other hand, the result that we could think about did not come to.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, technology said no.
You weren't the only one of the tops who left the fight early.
It also fell out of foreign favors of Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Are you surprised that so many favorites have resigned?
Yes.
It was a shame for the audience, especially because the race had come to an early end.
Jaromír Tarabus, who you're preparing a car, has moved on on a long time.
But he paid for his flight off the track and he took out almost two minutes.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame because he could have repeated the winner's degree.
I mean, he's been eating the first time.
But Mira also confirmed that we've set up the car well.
He was driving very fast.
Just a year ago, you reported the end of your career, yet you showed up at Barum rally.
Can you feel good driving back to a regular rally racer?
Not at this point.
Last year, I said Barumka was my last race, and I still couldn't keep it.
I decided to go again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I'll probably do it.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people have come to the track because of you.
Did that make you happy?
To some extent, we were starting because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, have constantly asked if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What does Barumca expect you to do?
The team continues.
Next week we'll go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the Fabia Honza Sýkora from us at this race.
With Mira, we have a European two-way in Switzerland and in Korsice.
That's what we're gonna have to do next year.
Can you suggest anything?
No, nothing's decided.
When Korean rally belonged to the World Championship, you reached your fifth place there maximum in the series.
Doesn't it dare you try that track again?
She doesn't.
An oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not let your doctor confirm that you are incompetence, which serves as evidence to the organization that you cannot carry out your work duties for medical reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately notify the employer.
Thereafter, there was an agreement that the given days would be registered as a holiday, but the agreement had only taken place orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation on the employer to confirm in writing the consent of the employer with the use of leave, this procedure has been proven in practice.
If there is an oral agreement, you have no confirmation.
Later, the alleged consent with the use of leave, as in your case, may be denied and absence at work can be considered as a long-term unsolicited absence, therefore a reason for the immediate abolition of the employment ratio under Section 53 of the Labour Law.
In case of a court dispute with the employer, you are so lacking evidence.
However, the working relationship with you has not been cancelled in accordance with § 53, you only have the given days listed in the credit sheet as an unsolicited absence.
Unsolicited absence in the credit sheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the inability to receive material security in unemployment), yet it is difficult to find new jobs.
We recommend you to visit the doctor again and confirm in writing that there has actually been an accident which caused you to be incompetent (not a so-called "incompetence", it is only a medical document).
In search of a new job, you can present the above document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate on incapacity and the early notification to the employer or the request for written consent with the use of leave.
You avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart accident when returning to the track
The return on the track ended for Tony Stewart just a little bit behind half the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stewart ran into play two times after his right front tire broke in 172, and the race ended for him.
Stewart drove a damaged car into the garage, the reporters didn't show up and leave.
The head of his Chad Johnston team said that team of cars No. 14 is disappointed, but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I wish we had better performance and better conclusion," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we get more.
Stewart came into play for the first time on Sunday night's race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which demanded a fix on the right side of his car.
“To this race we hoped for good endings,” said Johnston and added: “This did not work out.”
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend, and he needed to win either a race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch up on the table.
He returned to the race during the investigation of a tragic accident, which killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who drove Stewart into the road during the race.
The authorities have said that the investigation of the cause of the accident will take at least two weeks.
So far, he hasn't decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The triple champion had received warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started at 12th place, worked at the beginning of the race at 10th and then even 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, with Busch's car no.
18 got out of control, went out of the second corner and hit Stewart, which sent both cars to play.
Stewart continued, but went back to 21st place.
Prague has selected a new taxi station manager, making $12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new taxi service controller.
For 103 parking stations, about CZK 12.3 million will be paid annually.
Until recently, for the same seats for taxi drivers, she picked 150 thousand crowns each year.
He informed Councilman Luke Manhart (TOP 09).
The former city used lottery ticketing in the selection of administrators.
The winner then got rent for a flat-rate amount of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
The offer is currently being made.
"The year after the termination of the initial lease contracts and the opening of the tendering procedure has proved that the new lease system is much more advantageous and fairer for Prague," the councilman claims.
The most expensive spot is on Perstýn
The highest prize was offered to the guests about the post office on Na Perštýn.
They will pay a year of 2.1 million crowns.
About CZK 1.5 million were paid by new administrators for places in front of the General House or at Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for renting taxi service stations were adopted in the autumn of 2012 and in summer of last year the original lease contract was announced.
The selection procedure took place in four waves and 29 posts were found by the new administrator.
We had to clean the well for the second time this year.
We released her every time, creating practically another pond around the cabin.
Then we poured Savo.
Unbelievable smell!
Our well in the cellar was always enough wonderful fragrant water.
And it wasn't someone who was professionally trained, Granddad used to tell her his help.
A long time ago.
She was just about three scruples and totally arbitrary, like everything at the cabin, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until the flight.
When we started the season, of course, we exhausted the water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, we thought that water didn't smell.
We were wondering if anything went down there.
In the place where the pump was going, it was possible during a bit of bad luck, there was quite a plate, so the opening was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
There was nothing else to see in the water, and it was lightened to the bottom.
So we released it again and reread it.
Of course, we improved the amplified seal around the pipe pumps.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
He was lying on the floor with some bones.
That's what it looked like.
And a piece further away.
Now it looked like a dirty mouse.
At the ceiling, in the places where the vents are, the granddad's inventions were the remains of the fish!
And heavy!
Our store is clear, too.
Someone would think Grandpa would just dig up the cabin.
And it wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just suffocated sand, only the ceiling is undermined.
They're putting ships in there, mostly.
And wheels.
And a beach lounge.
Back to the wide spaces was usually open, as in all the time, someone walked.
At the ceiling, several previously mentioned vents.
Without a net, they usually fly birds and build nests on beams.
It's useless to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to break, and that's it.
Now, of course, the barrel didn't help.
The whole store smelled.
So we cleaned the entire cellar.
Especially the tree fish was nutritious!
We also threw out the things that were around: planks, a heraltic board, and everything.
Our remote cottage was welcomed by a disinfectant.
We were wondering who could have pulled our disgusting remains?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
It's hard for her to come over.
Grandpa attacked a neighbor who's not completely well.
If Franta didn't give us the disgusting things he didn't blow in the air?
It's practically been here all year, stupid ideas, that's what he's got.
We decided to watch and check the basement and the well regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, just washing and washing before the tests were done, but it was already good.
Pulling water from a forest well is nothing I'd like to do for a long time.
We once heard a terrible anxiety bark of our bitch.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw in the grass next to the veranda, a long black hose.
She was jumping over her and crying like a fool.
My mom hired her because she thought Reza was picking up a garbage hose from the sink.
But suddenly, the hose was partially rolled into a club and partly related.
The balcony was packed.
It's got an hysteric seizure.
We ran down.
Jaw, long over the meter and fat as a bulldog, was about to swallow a giant oil and Rzeza kept it from her.
It wasn't clear whether she wanted to save her oil or whether she wanted to eat it alone, but that was irrelevant.
When she saw the overflow in the form of our whole family, she probably said to eat it when we were hungry like that, and elegantly crawled into the basement.
We followed her.
Like lightning, she jumped over the well.
Just by the way, we recorded another stinking package on her plate.
I guess it's fish, according to the smell.
She wasn't there before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a slick.
And that's what we closed the basement during the day.
That he would...
We went out, and there we all went down to one vent.
We didn't wait long.
It blew up in the wells.
First, a flat header appeared with yellow monthlys on the neck.
And then she took a whole rock to the well.
She's been around the pump, and she's starting to get inside.
An outcast employee got revenge, bought some laptops at the company and sold them.
After release, an employee purchased a computer company and then sold them.
The money received was to be spent before the police were detained.
In a short time, a man purchased 16 computers in twelve cases for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"The notebooks were taken to Olomouc, where he sold them after the bazarech," said rumper police commissioner Rostislav Brückner.
The motive for fraud was the employer's revenge for release and also the profit of money.
"He told us during the interrogation that he used the money to pay off the loans," said Brückner.
Police also found out that a fraud is a pathological player who has repeatedly treated himself as psychiatrists.
So the money could also end up in winning instruments or videoloterial terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money from him," the Commissioner said.
A cheater who has been punished for theft once already threatens to stay in prison for one year to five years.
Police have not yet informed whether there is a threat of punishment to bazaars who bought and sold laptops under the price.
"It is true that they have taken over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the Commissioner said.
However, none of the basra owners have been charged yet.
Come on, a little further, you can do it or as I enjoyed We Run Prague
The organizers prepared a few changes for us this year.
The biggest was the change in the route that brought the target to the flood instead of leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of Rungo.cz team, I was going to enjoy it a little bit on the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the booth, where we took pictures and filmed videos.
To reach my perspective on the other side of perfection, I accepted the role of a personal conductor.
Together with our friend Koťa, we held ourselves in the end of the corridor 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted friends who walked past us to the faster runners sector.
There's not much time left.
Couple of warm-up jumps, turn on athletes, countdown and start!
The screams of the brightness, but instead of a quick start, there was a clinging to the starting line.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, turn the measurements and run at an hour of ten.
We sail through the yellow snake of the runners, who, like Koťa, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, slowly falling sun in the sky adds a view of the Vyšehrad almost to the short breath.
The pulsating mass stretching along the waterfront looks like Prague is running all over the place.
On the waterfront between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre is traditionally beginning to show who has the strength.
A light dome on Palacká square forces many runners to slow down or cross the walk.
I see a police escort just before I go to the Theatre and immediately follow it Víšek Pavlišt is flying with an incredible pace to the target.
I can hear the admirable exhausting of other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, encourage him, he's going to hit me, but right before that, my leg gets its butt sores and our hands fall right off.
The Theatre Street Stress gives a chance to relax and breathe.
We need places to breathe in my views.
The turning point on Mánes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the falling sun.
I'm not breathing, and my legs are almost alone.
There's a moment of truth in the first refreshment.
During the crossing of the road, Káťa globs about the curb and shows a jump through the cruise.
I see if she doesn't need help, and I'm starting a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It's getting up and we're going up the Kozí alley, it's one of the narrowest places of the track, at this stage of the race, although there's no such a load, but we need to follow the area well.
I still have no idea that the concept of the narrowest place will get its true meaning later.
We are encouraged by tourists as well as by friends of other runners behind the Dust Gate.
I'm trying to slap anyone who offers their hand, and I'm recommending it, too, because ten flashes with fans are like half the energy bars.
It really works, we speed up again, and even though we have fallen quite significantly, now the striker has started.
We run dozens of runners, when I have someone particularly tired, I try to encourage him in a few words: "Come on, a little further, you can do it!"
No one's charging us for the last snack, speeding up.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three miles to target will hurt, but you really need to take a bite.
The sun has fallen slowly and the end of the day symbolically ends the race.
The last run on the bridge, turn around, and just a straight line to the target.
The temp we're running around makes me wonder where this girl is going?
"Come on, let's go under 13 o'clock, let's go!" I call.
We're trying, printing, and there's a target.
Thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
Coach set 20 o'clock.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
Closely for the goal, Káta is to break down her legs, to help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also the happiness of the well-run performance.
After a while, I slowly take her out of the target space.
Euphoria doesn't let us think of the push-ups in the lockers' passageways.
Here we can see that Kozí's alley wasn't the narrowest place.
This is all the way up here to the target of a raid, which is supported by almost 10,000 runners loaded to crack.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's no place for him.
I'm losing my head for a while, too, wondering if the wonderful views and the more interesting route was worth what's going on in the target than last years.
I know from my own experience that having a race isn't fun.
If ten thousand people are added to this, the rich accompanying programme and the closure of the whole centre of Prague for all transport, then there is a huge challenge.
This year's shift showed the runners a lot of interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere, pumped in Yellow Spa, was transferred between the runner and the race itself.
The organizers around the line and random audiences were taking her up on every meter of the line.
Unfortunately, during the urban run of the historical center, there must be obstacles that cannot be removed, but the target of a mass race in a place that is narrowed down on one side of the wall and on the other river, I do not consider the best solution.
If I think the race is over by running the target, I'll evaluate it as a very successful one.
I was a little concerned about the health involved, but finally everything worked out fine.
Write us in the discussion if you like the route and what you say about the situation in the target.
Prison overseers in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of employees of prison services throughout Bulgaria participated in the national protest assembly before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
The peaceful demonstrations reiterated their demand for reintroduction of the original working conditions that have recently changed.
There are higher wages on the list of requirements to be discussed with the interim minister Hristo Ivanov.
The overseers objected to the new working time for the month and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shift.
Although prison overseers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
"One is still in progress," said BNR Head of the General Directorate for Prison Services Rosen Zhelyazkov.
Members of the Federation of Trade Organisations of Employees at the Home Office are also expected to join the protests of prison staff.
Why the universe can have more dimensions and we don't see them
Physics usually don't write bestsellers, but Brian Green from Columbia University went black in 1999.
His book Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to break into the blasphemy problems that today are addressed by a number of theoretical physicists - to try to unite two great working but incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One cause of the success of the Elegant Space undoubtedly is that in the case of finding a united physical theory, it is not about a boring story.
The basic problem between two key theories (although at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and solves the idea that it is worth overruning even laymen.
In addition, Greene managed with a complex material as fresh as he could not account for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he revised his "failure" mostly in two other books: the structure of the universe and the Hidden Reality.
Apparently, the author would not object to anything if his book provided faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the elegant universe still provides almost everything that the informed lay with ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is relatively likely that in the coming years it will only be something more lively in this area (although the LHC speeder will finally go to "full gas"), and so it is a good time to enter Greenm's unsustainably open door of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound foolish, fantastic, strange or mystical.
Yet, it is specific and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our sight away from the universe for a moment as a whole toward something more groundly, namely, a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that you will draw a centimetre garden hose on one side of the canyon on the other side, and you will follow the whole scenery from a half-kilometre distance (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such distance, you can easily record a long length in a horizontal direction drawn by a hose, but if you don't suffer by the sharpness, the thickness of the hose is hardly clear.
In view of your great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks where the ant was at a given moment, you only answer it with one particular indication: the distance of the ant from the left (or the right) end of the hose.
All we want to do is say that from a half-kilometre distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has a thickness.
If we increase everything, we'll suddenly see the second dimension - in the shape of a circle that rotates the hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that an ant may actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well-known left-right dimension after the length of the hose, but also in the "dimensional in/against the direction of the movement of the clock hands", i.e. around the circular section of the hose.
You begin to understand that you have to enter two numbers to determine the position of a small marble: how far from the end of the hose and where it is on the circle of an emerging hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is bidimensional (notably, the Experts will see that this chapter focuses purely on the fault theory of string.
The non-routine aspects shall be discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is bidimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, dimension in the direction of the perimeter, marked with a circular arrow, is short and threaded.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easy to see.
The dimension of the developing hose is short, "strengthened" and worse noticeable.
To realise the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a much better resolution.
The mentioned example illustrates the important characteristics of spatial dimensions.
That they split up into two groups.
They can be either large, vast, and therefore directly visible, or on the contrary, small, corrupt and far worse observable.
Of course, in this case, we did not just succeed in revealing the "favoured" dimension of the tube thickness.
It was enough to take a telescope to help.
But if the hose was thinner-- like hair or capillara-- we would only reveal a dirty dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he spoke with an overwhelming idea that space geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions.
Kaluza’s radical claims were justified by the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein’s general relativity and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory of vetting into a single, united concept structure.
The question immediately arises as to how this Kaluzov observation goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer that Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which he clearly spoke and specified Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls under the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have as large and as small as he could have the wrong dimensions.
This means that, like a dimension in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has a large, vast and slightly visible three dimensions, the existence of which we realize every moment.
But analogically with the circular perimeter of the garden hose, the universe may have an additional dimension, firmly attached to the space so small that they have remained hidden even from our most advanced experimental cameras.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluz's remarkable design, let's stay with the hose for a little while.
Imagine if we would draw a relatively thick line of circles on the hose circuit.
The looks of a hose still look like a thin one-dimensional line.
With a telescope now, thanks to the drawing, we reveal the wrong dimension even easier, because we will see motive from Figure 2.
Obviously, we see that the surface of the hose is bidimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with a second short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe had a similar structure, but besides one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, then a four-space dimension.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imaginations a little bit, let us see illustrations of the r.3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we increase the view of the geometry of the space as we have enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each next level represents a huge expansion of the geometry of the space from the level of the previous.
Our universe can have an additional dimension (see them on the fourth level increase), if they are screwed to a sufficiently small space; we explain that we have not yet seen them directly.
The Čtverc network shows commonly known as the "big" dimension, while the circle is new, raspberry, and tonic dimension.
Just like loops of thread in a thickly woven carpet, even these circles exist in every place of normal dimensions - only because of the clarity we only ranged them to the intersections in the square network.
The background of picture 4 depicts a commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such common standards as meters, represented by the sides of a small square in a square network.
On each of the following images we will focus on the small area of the previous picture; we will increase it to become visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see at the first few levels of enlargement.
However, when we follow the microscopic characteristics of the space geometry on our way further - on the fourth level of the enlargement in Figure 3 -, we will suddenly see a new, to the shape of the circle of the twisted dimension, which is likely to slip the thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came along with the idea that the additional circular dimension existed in every place in the direction of large dimensions similar to that of the hose circular circumference at each point of their length.
In the interests of clarity, we only covered the circular dimension in some regularly deployed points.
Figure 4 of Kaluzov and Klein's idea of a microscopic structure of the geometry of space summarizes.
The likeness with the hose is obvious, although we also record important differences.
First of all, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (only two of which we drew), whereas the hose has only one large dimension.
Even more important difference is that we're talking about space geometry of the universe itself, not just some subject within the universe, like our hose.
The basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularity dimension is extremely miniature, recognize it - as well as the circular circumference of hose - much harder than seeing obvious, large and wide dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact reveal it over the forces of our state-of-the-art instruments to enlarge.
The most important thing is that the additional dimension is not just a round peas inside the common dimensions, as bidimensional illustrations mistakenly suggest.
The circular dimension is a new dimension, which exists at each point of three common wide dimensions.
It is the dimension of the remaining three dimensions independent as are the dimensions of the above-dols, the left-right and the front-back independent (and the wheels) of each other.
A small cloud could move in all four dimensions and we would need four data to determine its position, except for three usual positions in a circular dimension; if we count time, then data five, in any case by one more than normally expected.

The price for an e-book is CZK 149.
To our surprise, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, it shows Kaluzovo and Klein's thinking that it is not excluded from the existence of additional drilled dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The latest technical equipment can recognize the structure of a large billions of billions of a meter.
We can barely observe a small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small dimension.
In 1926 Klein combined original Kaluz's idea with several ideas from the very birthing quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that an additional circular dimension could be about one Planck's length, which is far beyond the discernment of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional minor spatial dimensions of Kaluzova-Klein theory.
Wonuh Honza Homola advises how to practice electric guitar: 5.
The whole nature of the "twelfth" consists of a twelve-way harmonious form, which you can literally repeat.
The person who grotes in the musical theory will find its principle in detail explained here.
Jan Homola or Honz Homola Tobolka (1976)
Education a puppet and a louter whose facebook profile can be followed here has been fed as a graphics since graduation 20 years ago.
He's a guitarist of Wonut's band, which I'm afraid you can't leave.
Kytarist is after his father, just like Brother Matìj, leader of the Wohns.
Start training on one string.
"The dynamic model is up to you, you can think of anything, just apply it to the harmonious model of the twelfth," says Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen to and watch Honza, what you can do with the 12 harmony on two strings, and how nice this is starting to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can already conceive with the tunes of some songs.
When you finally add the fourth, watch out for the change of tuning, warns Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonary and try to put her together with a twelfth.
Then practice it honestly.
As best you can read in an interview with Jane Homolou at the first lesson of his school of games on an electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not a big celebration, it's a castle Dvořák.
We take the point and we love it.
The first half we had more chances, the second home," said the attacker, who scored this time from the fine kick.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, after all, he was accompanied by a huge sandet?
Somehow, I didn't see it particularly, even though the other goal, where the home fans are, would probably be worse.
You've settled the pension after half an hour, but you've also gotten your goal out of the penalta in less than four minutes.
What happened?
We slept at the beginning, we were passive, came from that corner, and then the penalty.
After that, you got up, and the first half-time you were a better team who had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played good until the break-up.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep the pace of the game, too, but we couldn't do it.
To be honest, I can't even explain why.
It is also true, however, that they said something to their game about the break, perhaps they were not very satisfied with it.
You've only had one of those contestants on the field for the first time while you haven't even got a goal at home.
Why is it so different?
I don't think that's the difference, it's more important to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad for us, Plzen, it is a different category.
Four matches were waiting for the goal, weren't you worried that after the last game might be similar?
I don't think so, but of course we're glad we've heard from the last fight that we don't have to talk about waiting for the goal to listen.
Now we have added another one without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet for the great celebration.
Iceland - the lion flows from a kilometer away.
The lava flying onto the surface of the Holuhraun area near Vatnajökull iceberg flows through the underground tunnel from a kilometer away.
It is located under the ice, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now concerns the most...
The situation remains unchanged for now.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) continues to draw about the same amount of lava out of the fissure.
However, compared to the original estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" of 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous erupt with 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
But scientists fear that the lava tunnel can open even in places where it is under the ice.
In addition, if this were to happen, with similar intensity as the present erupt, this would mean huge floods on the Jökulsá a Fjöllum river as well as on other rivers.
There's a strong smell of sulphur in the area of the eruption, the clouds of steam and gases rise from the crack.
It is certainly not an erupt suitable for tourism, as was the case with the espionage of Fmmvörðuháls in 2010.
This is much bigger, and there is also much more gases," says the Vulcanologist Armann Höskuldsson.
However, since yesterday, the weather has improved significantly, in the early hours, it has been in the area almost unintelligible.
The trails on the sand storm were washed with rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
The orange level (second highest) for Bárðarbung and yellow (third) for Askju applies to air operations.
Heaven over Cheb belonged to the courageous Lady Peggy.
She went through the wings.
Summer day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 the air acrobat of Peggy Walentin, which in the flight came out of the cockpit to a castle on the upper wing of a two-plot and also among the wings.
There is only reference to muscle strength.
The summer day in Cheb was successfully completed this year and the organizers were able to prepare several interesting air bites again.
The premiere of the oldest Czech airport was not only "going on wings" in German acrobats Peggy Walentinová, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft aircraft 18.
He's been looking at himself with his bright pull.
The article known as Wingwalking is originating in the USA.
After World War I, he tried to enforce many former war pilots.
But because of a large number of fatal injuries, he was banned.
Today, however, slowly returns to the airday program.
Peggy gets out of the cockpit on the top wing after launch.
He's doing different exercises there.
At the end of the performance it is moved to space between the wings of the aircraft where its show continues," said Luděk Matìček of the Chinese Ultralight Club and organizer of the aviation day.
Pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E aircraft is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main core of the program, then the next performance of Mustang's fighter was the famed cherry on the cake.
Legendary fighter came to the area with Grippeny Arms of the Czech Republic in a curtain (so-called on the numbers).
This was the first time flight fans in the Czech Republic could see such a lineup.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then demonstrated to everyone the breathtaking acrobatia with the aircraft from 1945.
Made during the war, but probably never took part.
He was included in military reserves.
Since 1963, he has worked in a civilian sphere.
Even as a racing aircraft.
Today she has her home hangar at Munich Hradiště airport.
On the same site there is also another pearl of the chebian air day, two-engine Beechcraft C45H Exeditor.
He didn't go to the airport to miss the massive machine.
Its polished aluminium film went into the distance.
Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard also acquired the admirer in the colours of the French Air Force.
A small transport plane ended up in favour of the said Turbolet and a part of the German delegation came from Hofu on the air day.
German neighbours have shown themselves in Cheb with renovated planes How 18T or three-member formations of Bücker Jungmann bipliers.
A dramatic return to the camera!
The family worries changed Lucie Borhy for at least tonight's work.
Stress or nervousness - blonde moderator doesn't know anything about it.
Modernized television news was good for her, like she didn't stop with him for two months!
It's only been two weeks since the blonde ended on Sunday, when women experience the greatest stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not be regularly shown in TV Nova’s main intelligence report.
Regular return awaits her according to weather.cz information within a month.
After all, her daughter Linda needs her now more than television viewers.
Lucie Borgy returned to television screen, and it was hit in black.
Exhibition in a year in Prague?
Hala's gonna sell out, he's planning to say goodbye, Jigger.
It would be dignified if something like this happened during World Championships.
But it depends on how the union will build up," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition entitled Golden Match, in which the glorious Nagan team was reinvented.
Even players who participated in the Golden Hattrick.
Players would like it, wouldn't they?
I'm sure.
It would be good to just say goodbye to the gold generation during the championship.
I think they're going to be able to find one day during the tournament where it's complete free time and where it could be played.
We'll tell Gum (Iire Šlégr) or Béď Ščerban (the organizer of the jig fight) who would take care of it...
The arena would be sold out.
But what if you play with New Jersey Playoff?
Well, if I come by then...
But you don't want to play representation.
Or did the Jihlava meeting somehow alter your decision?
Representation and exhibition match are two different things and the representation are decisive performances.
One thing is, people would love to see me there, but performances are critical, especially at World Championships.
There should be players who have it and not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed much.
How did you actually enjoy the nagan reunion?
It was just a meeting with the players that was great.
You've brought back stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for hockey players.
But the most important honor was Ivan Hlinka.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that it's leaving one generation that's really worth it.
Slavomír Lenner, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the unit.
Will you still remember your first face-to-face?
You don't forget that kind of thing.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we entered in one three.
It was a first representation start for all of them.
Well, if we do dominate in some way, we can't say that.
Back in Jihlava after a long time captured Dominik Hasek.
What did you say to his performance?
Hashan never surprises me on the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hášek criticized Jágra for reasons why he decided to end up in representation).
Even the Hanička did a great job.
You were trained with me one night, and you were a mess.
And now he's caught pretty bad.
First the US and then the Netherlands, the footballers begin their qualification
The prominent guests were at the Prague NH Hotel on Monday morning.
People may have seen Peter the Czech goalkeeper from Chelsea, the coach coach of Pavel Vrb...
And over there, the character in the black hat, that's Tomáš Rosicky!
Arsenal reserve and the captain of the representation arrived at the reunion around half the 12th between the last.
We have a lovely fight against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" said he, when he had already stepped in front of a journalist in front of the board.
Programme of Czech Representation
Monday 1 September: start of the reunion, first training
Tuesday 2 September: Training opened for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramiad (20:00)
Wednesday 3rd September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) End of the reunion
Russian and spol. can support fans even before the mid-term match against the US (20:15).
The representation for them opened Tuesday's training, which starts at 6:30 Summer.
And after him will follow an autograph, which the Russian and the Czech will not miss.
Otherwise, this National Team meeting will be more peaceful.
Which commends Coach Vrba, who was complaining about the number of social events in spring.
Finally, we are dedicated to what we want to do.
Now we will focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage if you have a player together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not yet been so far," he praised Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
Czech football representation will accompany the Musketerist image when entering the new qualification cycle.
There are three matches under Vrbo, all prepared.
With Norway and Finland, 2:2 and Austria lost 1:2.
However, these results have not yet been important.
It's only now.
The fight with the Netherlands will start qualification for the European Championship 2016.
Of course, it would be helpful for the Czech Mansion if the U.S. general could manage.
The first half of the year was for us to meet.
It's important now.
We need to think about being successful," Vrba said.
The only player in the 23rd nominee with health problems is David Laphat's attacker.
He's suffering from temperature.
If he hadn't been able to heal himself in a midday against the United States, Coach Vrba would have called on another assailant.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how after a bad diagnosis she thought she was going to die for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teens thinking she had only a few years of life.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The Charity Organization of CMT UK said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because there is very little knowledge of disease.
It is believed that in the United Kingdom, CMT suffers some 23 000 people, which can manifest symptoms in the field of motorbikes such as muscle weakness, improbable foot walking and twisted fingers.
In the disabled, there may also be insensitiveness or pain, this condition is inlerable and progressive, which means that the symptoms are worsening over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, she thought he was suffering from Freidreich’s ataxia (FA) - a disease that had a very bad forecast.
She believed that before celebrating her 18th birthday, she would be tied to a wheelchair, and she was dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same thing as the others.
Every day, I fell, and it took me longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboard with other kids and at school, I was bullyed by the way I walked and ran."
When Rodgers was 13 years old, and she was after several operations to release her Achilles and to match her feet, she took advantage of the fact that her doctor left the room, and looked into her file where she found out she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was a man, and I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I searched for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the Association FA,” he says.
When they answered me, I was shocked, completely panicked.
I thought before I was eighteen, I'd end up in a wheelchair, and by the time I was 25, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd lose all my powers.
I was on my own, and I was planning a funeral."
When she was 17 years old, she realized that her ability to walk had not worsened as much as she expected, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said: “Honey, I don’t think you have the disease, or else you’d be in a wheelchair.
I think it's going to be something much less dangerous."
After passing several genetic tests, it found out he had a CMT.
“When he explained what CMT was, I thought I had a child brushed,” she said.
CMT UK has launched a month of information on CMT in order to draw attention to this disease.
Businessmen in Washington: taxes are taxed with economic turnover
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local taxation of companies in the country speeding up the recovery of the economy slightly increased last year, and companies in Washington were no exception.
Businessmen in Maryland and Virginia combined for fiscal year 2013 into state and local treasures took $21.6 billion, which is 3.8% higher than the $226.6 billion selected in 2012.
Tax burden - both state and local - came up by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and was the third growth year after 2009 and 2010, when taxes decreased.
According to a study conducted by Ernst & Young and the political grouping Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased by 4.3% faster than local contributions by 3.9%.
More than half of the tax revenue of the district, 56 %, is from the trade tax, and 36 % of Maryland’s income is from the company.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows proportionally the smallest tax revenue from business.
Researchers claim that the majority share of tax revenues growth comes from an increase in real estate value to companies, which this year tax on real estate after three consecutive years with growth -1% increased by 3.7%.
Although most profits come from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vrigini last year paid over ten billion dollars on state and local real estate taxes, which represents an annual increase of 4.2% compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in real estate value does not so much drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the real estate tax represents less than a fifth of the corporate tax.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the property tax represents almost half of the state and local taxation.
“In Maryland owns a lot of real estate companies, especially the tax base of D.C., government or non-profit organization that does not pay taxes,” explained Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services in other countries.
The recent increase in corporate tax revenues cannot only be attributed to a healing real estate market.
According to the data, revenue from business appears to increase as well.
Companies in this region have published a tax on corporate income of $2.3 billion which has increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland chose one billion dollars on corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are taking the same course, the local tax burden of entrepreneurs does not grow in these three places as quickly as possible.
The rate of growth in D.C. was at national average at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was an increase in tax below average, to 4.1 %.
Virginia has, from all three circuits (of which all have equal taxation) the lowest tax on corporate income, 6 %.
The rate of taxation of companies in Maryland is 8,25 % while the average of D.C. remains relatively high to 9,975 %.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxation and a more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. didn't evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia is facing the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a business tax law of 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and the tax will fall to 5% next year.
If the State continues to meet its revenue targets in the coming year, it could decrease to 3% in 2017 by the law set by the rate of income taxation.
According to a recent study conducted by small businesses in Washington, higher state and local taxes are therefore being paid.
Agricultural tax paid by small entrepreneurs as a tax on personal income - compensation structure by increasing costs by increasing prices, according to which most companies - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia have increased by 20% last year to 2.4 billion dollars, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers claim that the trend and national increase in trade tax are likely to continue next year, the overall tax revenues of both state and local governments will increase to 6.2% for the same period in the previous three quarters of 2014.
However, Washington may stand by others because the reduction of state spending is taking its tax on the labour market.
What you missed: Tusk, Putin Novorusko and Lafatov's scissors will be the boss of Europe
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for discussion on Novorusk
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the south-east of Ukraine, where government units with pro-Roman rebels have been meeting since April.
He also warned European companies that, following the current regime of anti-Roman sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided by the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine, according to him, contradicts democratic values.
The termination of the conflict according to him depends on Kiev, so he cannot tell when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has exercised the right to disagree with parts
The European Commission has, together with diplomats by week, to propose the form of further confirmation of counter-EU sanctions, decided by night at the EU summit today.
The reporters said it to the permanent chairman of the meetings of the Member States Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Saturday, concrete proposals should be prepared for the reposition of sanctions on Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuy will replace in December
At the summit of the European Union, Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Council, the so-called EU President, who runs the summit meetings of the Member States.
From December to December for two and a half years, he will replace Herman Van Rompuy.
At the head of the European diploma, Catherine Ashton will hand over the Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian, which will become Vice-President of the future European Commission, must still be confirmed by the European Parliament in its function.
The assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, but it is not mentioned
Helping an incomparable and long-term sufferer with his life out of his system?
In Czech conditions where laws do not allow euthanasia, this is not legal.
However, it follows from the doctors’ statements that LN has been hearing about such requests.
ALS: The toughest chapter of neurology, says the doctor about sclerosis
Czech patients suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) about three hundred people, 21 patients undergoing experimental treatment in Prague Motole stem cells.
We definitely don't know if she'll be successful.
But if we don't try it, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, Motol neuro.
It's in to know the CIA manuscript, they need war, it says Humle about shooting the MH17 flight.
The MEP behind ČSSD Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is obvious that "hard sanctions which were declared in the light of the shooting of a civilian aircraft with almost 300 dead caused the Ukrainian army intentionally".
According to the legislator, it's also worth knowing the CIA's manuscript.
Unfulfilled promises.
The elections are coming up and the parties are once again offering the impossible
End of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and rope above Prague.
This is repeated in front of each option: the parties promise impossible.
Also now, with the coming municipal elections, politicians are overcoming who will be more fond of voters.
The Lidovka server.cz has chosen inconclusive promises from both the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechs landed at Dunkerque's.
There's been a urnal siege.
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Her commander Alois Liška systematically requested the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side finally complied with, and this ground unit included as one of its forces in the siege of the port town of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German troops.

How to survive a return from vacation?
Do not hurry and enjoy your sleep
The last days of our vacation are ahead of us.
Get used after returning from sunny beach or cottages to the normal working speed can be for many nuts.
He may even be accompanied by depression.

Family Joan Rivers: “We keep our fingers”
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter today expressed her hope that she would not lose her hope that the 11 - year - old comet will heal.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," said Melissa Rivers in today's statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother brought her mother to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after the call for emergency service, according to which she had a cardiac arrest for the York endoscopy in Upper East Side, as indicated by the source.
Doctors will intentionally maintain it under the influence of sedation and under strict supervision until they are sure of its condition, which remains “principal.”
Responses didn't take long to wait, including incredible support on the internet from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is a twisted headline
That the media are twisting the reality with their headlines, there is no (godly) news.
I know the headlines "sold" by the paper, but unfortunately I also know that many so-called "readers" are not reading anything else.
And that's the fact that's been bothering me lately, the more accurate the word is.
This is particularly true of the articles on the conflict of Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
The headlines of "Israel attacked Gaza".
Only in the text you will learn that the Israeli attack was a reaction to the fired rockets from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the established ceasefire.
That's when the headline "We both sides broke the ceasefire" appears.
Does the press community realize that they are directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes throughout Europe (and not only there) growing?
Sixty years have not passed since the end of World War II.
So far, people who survived Shoo live.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd exclaimed the slogan "Jewish swine" and similar misdemeanors, it hurt me.
Is this what the world wants to finish what failed Hitler?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews they were meant to destroy the Slovaks?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please give a little more attention to your work.
You are often referred to as "watching dogs of democracy".
So defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of a single truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided that the Czech nation would be destroyed and the Czech Republic would wipe out the map?
Perhaps you should also realize one more fact.
In Israel, nearly 20% of Arabs live with Israeli citizenship.
And they're fine.
If you ask them why they don't go between theirs, or Gaza, they'll answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have work, social security and top health care (I saw for my own eyes how Hadassa’s top private hospital, which is financed by Jewish donations from all over the world, usually also Arabs, and are naturally treated there).
Hamas attacks his Arab brothers with his missiles.
The only real help of Gaza, and by doing so, is rid of Hamas and disarm him.
And not judge Israel, though indirectly in the headlines.
Inform the Hamas practices about its abuse of humans as human shields.
Inform that Hamas is intended to eliminate the state of Israel at any price.
Even at the cost of murdering innocent Arab children.
Inform me that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organisations.
Please inform that, in nine years' time, the government of Gaza could have been a growing area thanks to humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, who supplies water and electricity, for which Gaza administrators do not pay, and even get upset, that at this time power supplies are interrupted.
If Hamas hadn't invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that they could penetrate suicide attacks in the territory of Israel, but perhaps to build homes, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would have been much better.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON has just confirmed that Monday morning information: Internet retailer - producer of videos and hundreds of other things - buys $1.04 billion (970 million US dollars) video streaming service of Twitch.
The announcement caused surprises, not because no one expected Twitch to buy, but because it was expected that the buyer would be YouTube.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitche Googlu looked sure of one billion, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, who was founded only three years ago by Justin.tv, had been stepped up to become a generally used video streaming service - live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online transmissions from games - in the words of Business Insider “YouTube for Live Playing”.
The Twitche interface.
There are already popular videos of Let's Play on YouTube, a species where the mudrlanti (most older ones) give the games the processing of Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes up a lot in the Twitche description, so the news that YouTube buys Twitch doesn't bother anyone too much was a textbook example of how the company in place pays off the possible competition.
The idea is why the YouTube deal didn't come out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at present is the expression CEO Twitche Emmet Sheara: “We chose Amazon because she believes in our society, has the same values and long term vision and wants to help us fulfill it faster.”
Another mystery is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitche.
It's hard to understand what's so amazing about the game instead of real playing just to watch.
One thing is to watch a friend over his shoulder at three o'clock, like Resident Evil plays, and it's a whole other thing to watch a stranger get 20 hits in his head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
The next problem is that a lot of today's most popular games are from the player's perspective, so looking at their record without you being able to control the perspective, it's a pretty good recipe to get a headache.
I admit that games like speed run, in which the Rogerers of Bannisteers of our electronic time finishes the game in record time, are fun.
But if someone isn't a master of playing or humor, his channel on Twitchi probably won't be very interesting.
But what about a skeptic like me?
Twitch has 55 million visits per month and is fourth on the top of internet traffic.
How exactly will this Amazon use?
It's hard to imagine Twitch getting mixed into the Amazon Instant Video as elegant as it would have been to swallow YouTube.
Twitch has something every company would like to attract: the hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Principal Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch said, "believe in the future of games" and the media don't seem to be missing or like - a rumor - audience.
Second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of the American Ateist vlogger Arona Ra.
This time, "The Holy Scriptures are God's word."
The original video was added.
The second basic lie of creationism is belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by true human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things contrary to their religion, they often put us ahead of the question: Who will you believe?
God's Word or the word of man?
It is as if human examination was completely insignificant compared to the authority they represent having their doctrine.
Only when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they refer to the myths of God written by men.
If there really is an intelligent source with a purpose, then it is he who created a fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be him who invented the genetic formulas that match it, and it must be he who added another set of evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the final detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of that stuff.
But people can tell stories, tell stories.
And they were the people who wrote all the texts that pretend to be God's word.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written people, not gods.
The people who were "moved" or "inspirated" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listening to the dictatorship of angels, but the texts were not written to anyone but only mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and no more gods.
If there really were one real god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergénius, the ultimal entity of the whole universe.
If a book had ever written such a size, there would have been only one such book, only a holy font.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because human authors would not be able to measure with such a work.
And people wouldn't have to blindly believe her, because she would be consistent, based on credible and true evidence, and she would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would continue to inspire every reader to share faith in unity.
If he wrote it to God, we wouldn't expect anything smaller.
But what we see instead is the opposite.
Instead of the only religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all of them are constantly falling apart on more and more distinct denominations, seeking the disputed truths, and each way claims God's guidance, regardless of the continuing disparity and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Tóra, Christian Gospel, Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'llahu Kitab-i-Akdas, Zarathuštre Avesty, Sikhský Adi-Granth, Mahakharat Bhagavad-Gita, Kniha Mormonova, or the book of Urantia are all regarded as "absolutní truth" and "the revealed word of the only true god" and the faithful each of them say that the rest are on the verge.
The only logical explanation is probably everyone's point of view.
None of the books mentioned above has any advantage over others.
None of them have evidence of resistance, and none of them can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it isn't.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologies, because they contain irregularities, absurds and primitive ideas once considered to be true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be claimed that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote an abomination instead of morality, and many claim to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - with the fact that everyone can also contain a prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
First theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and therefore are the subject of interpretation, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudiced politically motivated authors, explaining many of the oppositions and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it counter-corruption, more like mutual comments.
We must again point out that we have two different authors, whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author, and he's certainly not the story of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentatateuch, i.e. five books of "Mojos" and Moses do not sign the authority of any of them, because they almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered at the same time and all are credited to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as the faithful think it is.
The scrolls from the Dead Sea are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet many centuries younger than the roots of zorostrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, heleneism, druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a gnostic faith, followed by docites and Ebiotics and their completely different insights into Jesus, who eventually combined in some sort of compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups were discredited and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these regulations refers to the king of Ugarita who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Since his followers represented a major threat to young men's men's men's religions, the authors of the New Testament decided to laugh and Ba'al Zebula, "The Pen on the Mount" changed to Belzebub "Pán much".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently modified for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in a series of commission decisions on the snow in Nicaragua.
The four gospels were accepted, and 16 others were rejected by simply raising their hand, as if the reality of some things had been accepted or refused to vote.
The way that canon evolved depended on what it was read about Sundays in the Christian centres.
What was read on the second Sunday following Easter in the Jerusalem Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually found out that he was approaching the same Gospel stories.
And so this is how the kane core evolved out of the mouth of the first church.
So the council simply accepted as the gospel any relevant stories that were going on between uneducated masses at that time.
Still, they consciously received more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were recounting books approved to them.
Among the forbidden entries we will find both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved this way if God was the real author of this random blender's reputation, parable, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible has certainly been written to people and certainly not too enlightened, rather on the contrary!
That's why there's so much of her historically and scientifically completely wrong, whatever it is from the beginning to the end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys can speak, believed in spells, blood offerings, ritual magic, enchanted objects, fire doctors, astrology, and five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used the magic rod that they spray someone with blood, it would cure him from the glue.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were chewers and bats are birds and whales are fish and they say they're a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant carcases striped patterns, they would give birth to striped telata.
How could anyone say that about genetics?
Of course, the authors of this book didn't know that.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, then it would not contain such errors as it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as literal history, then it would contain nothing of what it contains.
As a moral guide, she is totally failing because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written down by uneducated and bigothic savages, who ignored or encouraged cruelty against animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, child abuse, child abuse, abortion, plentiation, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God’s will.
But Crecionists keep ignoring all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the reality must be ignored!
Why?
Because if Creacionists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
There's one thing in their world, the other.
It is ironic that they reject God's "share" as "the worship of creation instead of the Creator".
But they themselves consider the word of man as the word of God and God himself, and they even insist on turning their supposed "holy" books away from God as such.
Not their version of God, but all the versions of God.
Creacionic Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God lies.
They cannot accept that God could exist, and the Bible could at the same time be wrong because they cannot separate the doctrine from the divinity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship a man who makes a compilation, as if these books were God himself, because he thinks they are Jehovah's word.
Only God never wrote nor dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their allegedly "morbiding word" of any god has been pronounced, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often intentionally changed and twisted by only misguided people.

Attacker in Chinese school stabbed nine people, three of them died
A man named Chen, according to the New China Agency, was violently invaded by a basic school building and attacked about a half-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six
Three of the nine men he stabbed died later in the hospital.
Chen then killed himself by jumping from the height, said New China with reference to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection for children in a country where many married couples have only one descendant in accordance with government policy.

Apple iCloud reportedly reportedly reportedly to hackers, there are naked images of celebrity on the public
Unique file listing screen image
So far, an anonymous user on the 4chan server publishes naked and pornographic images of America's celebrity, alerted it to the American Mashable.com server.
It is reportedly obtained by unauthorized access to the users' accounts on the Applu servers, where the disabled users recorded them by automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple hasn't expressed himself to the problem yet.
Part of celebrity rejects images as falsified but has already acknowledged several trueness of images.
Among them are actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for her title role as Katnisss in the Hunger Games or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in the Deathtrap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the downloaded images and videos to enrich them.
The footage reportedly showed an interest in American magazines, according to news on server 4chan, but the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web server, it is very likely that the weakness in iCloud security is very likely.
On GitHub server, a tool appeared two days ago that allowed you to get password to user accounts through rough force, i.e. by automatically repeating attempts to login with different passwords.
This tool clearly worked, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to different accounts before publication of this instrument.
The iCloudu users should thus change their Apple ID password for preventive reasons.
The length of the password, not its complexity, is important.
The length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
The disappearance of naked images of celebrity should be regarded as a reminder of the secure use of online services.
Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are protected many times better than computers in households or smaller companies, the upload of sensitive photos in an unprotected form of unnecessary risk.
If you want to back an explicit photo online or any other sensitive content, files before upload, first encrypt.
It is also understandable to set automatically back-up photos from your phone so that it only takes place at wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
Thus you will have the opportunity to move "to security" in time and especially you will have space to delete missing images, so they will not necessarily collect space in the online repository.
We offer instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet to readers HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valášek in PDF format.
Smart way to save for college script
Since the price for a college script for many students exceeds $1 000 per year, the incoming second year student came in a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a system of borrowing books from classmates with an offer of nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
“The bill for calculations, which normally costs $180, I got ten for the semester and for chicken nuggets”, says Schroeder, 19 who is studying at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, says.
He spent 120.
According to the university board, an average student spends over $1200 a year on textbooks, but students have different options to handle these expenses.
Online trades and creative solutions such as Schroeder’s are the preferred choice of students.
On the rise, lending is textbooks, which enables students to use the semester book often with a significant discount rather than buying it.
Neebo Inc, operating more than 250 bookshops on campus sites, says the book rental has doubled since 2011.
The survey in the sector shows that around a quarter of books in university bookshops were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are purchased by the National Association of University Shops in university bookshops.
There are 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
Prices of some new books can be on the internet up to one third lower than in the university bookshop.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but it is possible on the Internet to buy a new $239.99 book on Chegg.com.
Buy Used
If you do not mind comments of other people or of wear and dishonour, appropriate teaching texts are used.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" sells for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, senior year student at Brigham Young University, says that at Amazon.com he paid for the copy used “Strategic Media Decorations: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” 42 cents.
The new one was selling for $48.
University Teacher Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls suggests that students with their tutors verify that older issues are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not important for work in seminars.
If so, the older editions may be sold as a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are popular alternative to purchasing used books also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Loans
It is also worth renting textbooks, if you treat them well, you do not forget to return them, and you do not need to have them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for about $20 for the whole semester.
Meet the terms of the trade in which you borrow the book, including the impact on notes, highlighting or using and damage.
Keep in mind: If you don't return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to provide yourself with a regular e-book book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for some time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg's borrowing the Callculus for six months for about 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, the most advantageous offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, walk around the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon come to Pepperdine Law School, recommends to follow according to ISBN, because it ensures that you buy the right book.
Before you order your book online, make sure it's really in stock, advises Gaul.
He's convinced it on his own.
The book he bought was expired for four weeks and had to pay the full price for a book from the university bookshop.
Bahna, it's mud.
And then they found a rifle hole in the well from the end of the war.
This well is situated close to St. George's Church.
We discovered the growth around and we began to pull out the summer load - about a meter and a half mud and a rotten leaf.
When we approached the yellow day, we hit the head," said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found out it was a torto of attack German rifles used by SS units.
The find is allegedly unusual.
According to my intel, such rifles were made by the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand," Novák added.
All wooden construction items have been broken down over time, therefore it is useless.
Of course, her body is preserved - it holds its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe she was thrown in by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS forces, probably out of fear, so that they wouldn't be pushed away.
The Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
These have cast guns in the forest," the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing that the fans from the Duha Jeseník movement found in the well.
"We could also have hand grenades, those were here once around a lot, which is why we slowed down the dig work, carefully reminiscing the mud, so that there was no accident, but nothing else was down there," Novák approached.
The find will end up in the museum depository at the castle in the nearby Silesian Rudolfice.
Ukrainian General: I haven't delivered a prisoner Czech so far
Exclusive interview News.cz with General Volodymyre Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of Prorui separatists.
Kyev/Praha - "Sorry, I have to take this... call me from Donetsk," he excused me eight times in an exclusive conversation with Actual.cz Ukrainian general Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also director of the local Center for the liberation of war prisoners.
General Volodymyr Ruban in a TV debate.
At each such interruption, it was not possible to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - which Ruban makes out with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"It will be it - go there," he ended one of the lightning discussions with Doneck and was once again dedicated to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in position, a local pilot fighter and an active party to anti-government protests in Majdan.
Yesterday -- when we had an interview, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of Proruska separatists takes place forty hours a day.
Currently.cz: Maybe you know that the Czechs are fighting on the side of the Prorui separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to thirty.
But there may be a lot more of them.
Have you met any Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have released prisoners of Serbian, Dagestán, Chechnya, one Swedish, Gruzence... but not yet Czech.
But I know who to turn to in Prague, if we run into your captive countryman, and we can free him.
Ukrainian soldiers captured separatists
A.cz: What advice do you advise the Czechs who join the pro-Prorusian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers to take them?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in the Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and separatists, they shoot them after questioning without mercy, just like any other foreigner.
The Separatists consider these men renting mercenaries, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers take over a group of Donetsk separatists - and among them also Czechs - they sit behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
The guy's just gonna survive.
The Ukrainian party is also acting in war as a state.
A.cz: And how many have you managed to save Ukrainian captives?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources say it's already crossed a hundred men.
Long time ago, we've stopped counting how many people we've helped.
We've just freed them... from war, unless they decide to continue fighting.
The saviors are doctors, surgeons, but we're definitely not.
That's the way it is.
And every day more and more.
We'll save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be about exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to release prisoners and just a human request.
A.cz: It is said that in a few months you have gained great authority and even confidence in the prorui separatists... as well as in the Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both wars?
Hard question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "a crazy general with steel balls."
It's not insulting me.
And maybe that explains the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Court of Deputies, I have gained some authority before.
I never snore, I don't cheat, and I always keep my word.
Whatever's going on, I'm acting honestly and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it's a Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhanan government, very uncomfortable.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm simply telling them that they torture and kill them.
And they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even when I turn captives and captured... this job can always mean the end... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many executions and torture do you know about prisoners?
...(long silence) ...to torture prisoners, Ukrainians and separatists are adjourned in the hearings.
I'm sorry.
And executions?
They're on the tip of the Donetsk.
Also, I have no information about the Ukrainian army ruling prisoners.
No indication of the Ukrainian army letting something like this happen.
We have an idea of a lot of executions, but I can't show numbers, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Please describe the characteristics and motives of the proruz separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They seek independence and perhaps even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - so at least they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The Separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth, and they are their unmistakable opponents - to life and to death.
As we say, they passed through their throats.
The same dreams and desires people also showed up in Majdan, by the way.
And now I am a bit forward: Russia supports separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be large, and the other is too small.
This sentence of mine already hides an inexhaustible conflict.
A.cz: How does one of the toughest leaders of the prorui separatists Igor Bezler appear to you?
Every time I cross the lines of the war front, I'm unarmed, showing to soldiers or armeds my bare hands.
And they always have me on both sides of the two hundred or three hundred meters on the shell or in the optical direction.
The faces of the people who are pointing at me, I see well every time... and they can press the trigger of their weapons at any time.
An expert colonel with both German and Ukrainian ancestors.
It is considered to be a Russian officer, but his family - mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a little gumber in a great Russian empire.
In any case, they keep talking about it, and Ukraine considers it a kind of misunderstanding.
Such a state he believes should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an unmistakable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we talk about characters - in the discussion show of Ukrainian television, you called your Prime Minister Arcenije Jaceňuk to be a weak, helpless and tired leader, who would do the best if he left quickly.
Over three hundred feet of walking, I'll always get at least five times scared.
Why, then, should I hide with the opinion that Jaceňuk is a very weak Prime Minister and that he is hurting our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
Perhaps you know that the Ukrainians of Jacenuka seem to be "the king".
And the rabbit is not in the sight of the Ukrainians an animal, from whom fear would go, or should be with other respects and authority.
His behavior directly copys the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as Prime Minister, he has no right to cry in Parliament, beg him, play with him intrigues, threaten to lay down a function... he must manage the country, manage it and protect it during the war.
In jeopardizing the country, the Prime Minister has no claim to his family, his friends, to rest on the weeping emotions.
After all, he is the first of Ukraine's ministers.
And Jaceňuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's complaining about everything all the time.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the galaxy couldn't save the market
Post-radatory 3 Sylvester Stallonea returned from the 90 millionth budget in the US less than 30 million dollars and Sin City: A woman who would have murdered only 12 million dollars from the 70th millionth budget.
The movie Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz Only $14.6 million during the first weekend and also children's films like How to train dragon 2 were a disappointment to the cinema.
According to an article by Robbie Collin's film critic in Telegraph, children's films are about their quality in wine itself.
Collin named 2014 "the worst" year of children's films, and how to train dragon 2 called just a "functional" continuation.
When it comes to films placed on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily need to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July it compared Entertainment Weekly servers CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average rating of summer film premieres sent in at least 2,000 cinemas in the period between the Day of Victims of War and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the view of viewers and film critics suggest that this year's film crop is similar to that of last year's hits.
According to some commentators, changes in audience access and higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix may be made to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, currently working on Disney’s Jungle Book Processing, said the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think the times are changing.”
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what's been done.
Unlike the current crisis of Hollywood’s cash marketers, Netflix gained $1.2 billion through Internet services, which is almost twice as much as last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, he criticized director Steven Spielberg for too relying on comic rights and foretold the Hollywood collapse.
In light of the current fall, some commentators declare that something may be on his catastrophic belief.
With possible large cash markets in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoň and Jurassic world, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
A manufacturer of X-Men Simon Kinberg recently described a drop in markets simply “cyclic.” For Hollywood Reporter said: “The next summer will be flying the biggest cash registers in history and no one will worry about selling.”
KLDR again threatens Seoul, set off another short-range rocket
North Korea set off another short mine rocket, announced Soul.

The province says there's an underground launch ramp for Scud missiles.
This is another series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has conducted in recent weeks.
North Korea has done an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
Summit NATO: First protests in Newport and Cardiff

Teenagers had to be transported by air from Blue Mountains
DVA Young tourists were picked up by plane and transported to safety after spending the night at Blue Mountains, New South Wales.
A 16 - year - old girl and a 18 - year - old man went to Govets Leap in Blackheath.
When they didn't come home, a concerned relative called the police around 8:00 p.m.
The search squad was sent, including the local police and the rescue team, and a couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 o'clock in the evening.

Olomouc brought from Opava only a point, he had a winning on his leg.
The 23-year-old forvard could have decided, but in two of the greatest chances he failed.
The goal was called mainly close to three minutes before the end, but the site in the network ended at the goaltender of the Opava Josef Květoň.
I had it on my leg, so I have to give it a chance.
I am angry with myself," he put your bag of ashes on his head.
"I should've put it under my lid, it went a little bit," he said.
The Sigma Defensive did not allow that Opava much, except for Mikul's 11th minute raid, which covered the goalman Reichl.
Then they started pushing Hanáci, to the chances, but they didn't leave the block, and the missiles from the distance caught the May.
We compared for fifteen minutes, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the outgoing chance of yours didn't change, and so it ended 0:0," was freezing coach of Hanaks Leoš Kalvod.
Opava also took the point because of the absences in the assembly, where Peter Vavřík and three-scale shooter Petr Ševčík, who are visiting in Silesia from Sigma, other than the couple who were injured.
Unlike her earlier policy, she couldn't allow them to enter.
The replacements deserve discharge.
Sigma was a footballer, but we didn't let her get away with one standard," said Slezanów coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and fighting.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma got a draw on four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy Josef Lébra's boss, who, after defeat, gave Znojme his million deposit to the cash register by diametrically different performances in the next matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébra's warning, so it can't be said that the boys wouldn't want to fight," he noticed Kalvoda and added to the address of the sleeping shooter, "I believe it will come and when he gives the goal, it will start falling there.
But after the first season, I'm gonna cut him out to save my goals for the next match," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino's taken over Venice twice.
The film festival is in a different way through the crisis
After great enthusiasm for the opening film, Birdman, whose director Alejandra González Iňárrit, represented among serious candidates for the Golden lion, further days testifyed to the fact that the interest in the 71th edition of the Venice Festival fell slightly.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to 14 hundred, or because after Birdman followed critics recognized, but for the viewers less attractive images as a document on genocide in Indonesia 60 years The view of silence and other films with social theme from the American 99 homes to Iranian Powiek, in cinemas remained empty seats.
Heroes of Comics
Even a red carpet outside the festival palace did not wear crowds like in the past, and allegedly it stopped being a problem to get a last-minute place at the hotel.
The crisis in Italy is more than elsewhere and it is no wonder that it has affected even as important institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself as a lack of personality, but exclusively in relation to films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of Michael Shannon's comic superheroes and Andrew Garfield's comic superheroes, who had successfully completed dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations, the main event of the legendary actor Ala Pacin.
He's just lit up in two movies.
In the story of the Prophecy reported outside the competition, which he recorded Barry Levison, by Philip Roth's novel, has a four-seventy-year-old Pacino role that is close to him: an actor at the top of fame who suffers from depression from the end of career and personal life.
But seeing him just the next day as a weird owner of ironing from a rural town in Manglehorn, filmed by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for the best acting performance should not miss it - but does the artist of Paci's format still need prices?
Maybe his greatest satisfaction is the love of the audience, and especially the Italian one, since although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italy
After all, the Italian film is doing very well this year in Venice.
The black souls directed by Francesco Munzi became the first image paid by Birdman with a long sweat standing.
The Cabbrian branch of the mafia is seen in it by the view of the family relations between the clans fighting for power and money, and the director managed to align all the assumptions for a good film: a high-quality scenario, camera, music and actors.
He also captured the ventricular psychothriller The heart that was filming Saveio Costanza with Abeu Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost lost his own child with a serious anxiety.
On the contrary, both French competition films have not reached a warm acceptance of either the ransom for fame or 3 hearts, both of which sing on the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really excellent films, that is, Birdman and Black Souls, are not so little for the first half of the festival.
And even though the festival photos have a lot of depressing themes, a new film by Peter Bogdanovich called She's Funny That Way, funny comedyes listed in Venice outside the competition and shot in the style of American celebratory for 40 years, she was able to increase the mood for more than one day.
Police have caught four Pervigin manufacturers in Prague, the drugs have been taken from Poland
"The Detectives have held three men at age 42, 42 and 37 in recent days, and a 25-year-old woman who from November to August this year produced and sold the pervitamin drug in Prague 9, said Jan Rössler's police spokesperson.
First, on Tuesday, 12 August, an intervention force in Cihlářská Street caught a two-four-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who acted as a buyer of drugs in Poland and a dose seller in the group.
The next day, detectives arrested on the basis of prior consent of the prosecutor of the next member of the group, seven-year-old man.
Last of the four policemen arrived at the premises of the Malaysian Incineration on 20 August," said the spokesperson.
For the transport of drugs from Poland, a third woman received drugs
The main organizer had a wide range of influences.
In the workshop of the airport complex, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Koněvova Street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced pervitamin, provided various aids and chemicals needed to manufacture it and ensure the transport of medicines with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He later weighed, divided into plastic bags and sold methine.
With the transport of drugs from Poland or the sale of drugs, he was helped by an untrained woman of 25 years.
For that she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drugs produced," Rössler added.
The Kriminalists also carried out several home tours on the basis of a court order, where they secured drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, pay bags, syringes, hoses and other aids and articles, which, according to the expert, can be considered to be a complete equipment for the manufacture of methhamphetamine.
Dearer has been punished seven times since 1995
"From the evidence available, the police have found that since 1995 the main organizer has been a total of seven times indicted for property crime, the woman has not been punished," the police spokesperson added.
The last arrested was convicted in 2006 for the crime of sexual abuse and a seven - year - old mechanic, who has been prosecuted for freedom, has been criminalized nine times since 2009.
Even in him, it was primarily for property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman from committing a criminal offence of illegal production and other handling of passionate and psychotropic substances and poison, for which they are threatened with up to ten years in prison.
In three persons, he eventually gave the investigator to the state representative and an initiative to propose to impose ties where the judge finally placed them," the speaker said.
The fourth accused, the 17-year-old recidivist, ended up at large.
His position and role in this case were not as fundamental as other accused.
The police are still working with this man.

The price of this toy is CZK 318 305.
Moving gymnastics and secondary schools makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics show that gymnasts have good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
In schools over the last 14 days, great preparations have been carried out.
Most are routine issues, such as transferring pots from summer storage back to class and blowing their wings.
They're going to have a little more frmol on the magnesium gymnasium.
A few days before the start of the season, furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature are being searched for in the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, a four-year gymnasium in Hořice after three years opens up and renews its activity.
Not on the public, but on the private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not caused by the founders being so incompetent.
They had to wait for the existence of a school to be confirmed by the introduction to the register of schools managed by the Ministry of Education.
“The French Socialists should shut down and put France in order," says Francoise Holland, key allies.
Valls calls for a highly fragmented lefter to "show her support" to the fighting tuned socialist president, whose new division of functions did not meet the approval of most Frenchmen.
The President deserves universal respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said and cleaned up his applause.
As a compromise gesture, the Prime Minister insisted on the fact that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour working week, despite the passionate guesses of Emmanuel Macron, a new finance minister who proposed that the rules be released at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday Holland, he asked Socialists to remain “consistent” with the government.
Christian Taubir, Minister of Justice, but she gave him a line over the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel socialist Members, where the Socialist Party criticized for losing faith in the future because of her.
Marine Le Pen, extremely conservative right, has been laughing at constant internal disputes between socialists when she has declared that it does not foresee that the new Valls government will last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls was also forced to set up a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one will not last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen said to her supporters.
She repeated her party's call to dissolution Parliament and declared that she was convinced that the party could win early elections and that she was ready to drive the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in March's municipal elections and in May an extremely conservative right has succeeded in elections to the European Parliament.
According to a public opinion survey of the Journal du Dimandche weekly, 76 percent of the French think that the Socialist Party poses a risk that they will split into several rival factions before the end of Holland's term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist of Science Po, warned that the French will soon experience patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a restricted area for opportunity, but public opinion must think that changes are taking place," he warned.
Otherwise, things might get worse.
Gambling and street art no longer limits Prague to the election
The amendments to the relevant decrees should prepare and approve the new leadership of the capital.
From the streets of Prague, there will be no more gaming room and the city will not restrict street art.
There will be no limit to walking dogs.
Prague will not be in the October elections to prepare and approve the changes to the respective decrees at the representative office.
"The decision on changes should also not be made by the city's current leadership, which ends in a few weeks' mandate," said Councillor Lukas Manhart (TOP 09).
Several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel gambling in recent weeks.
Herny doesn't go away. The gambling decree isn't going to change yet.
It is the task of a new city leadership after elections.
We would now neither technically reach it, for example, with regard to the time limits for comments and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the recent negotiations of the current representative, which must be approved by the amendment of the decree, will take place on 11 September.
The referendum on the full ban on gambling is taking place on the day of municipal elections of Prague 1 and Prague 8.
The gambling ban is currently being applied, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the announcement will not change even in the case of street art, so-called busketing.
In particular, it complains to Prague 1, which has already sent a master's proposal for places to expand the current list of prohibited places.
Musicians also want Praha 5 in the area of Angel.
The claim to regulate the walking out of dogs is going to be done for several months, so far it's not finished.
The location of the actor and the issue of the bosking solves city decrees.
They may be issued or modified only by the Deputy Mayor of the capital.
The town hall only has an advisory voice, and they can't issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed the victory on the sponsors of Scottish independence at his fingertips
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making this mistake three times when it almost placed billboards all over Scotland asking whether they wanted to be rich in Scotland.
But you can't get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, nor getting their respect if you start threatening them.
Morálka of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots have a much bigger tendency to drive money out of the temple than let them dictate how to vote.
The leader of the Scottish Nazis Alex Salmond knows this well, and therefore he repeatedly questioned his opponent, Unionist Darling, whether he is willing to respect the "surrene will of the Scottish people" if the Scottish voters voted for independence, and to start supporting the united currency for Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to vote between Scottish civil society and London’s financiers, and he fell into this trap.
Of course Darling will not support the mandate of Scottish voters.
However, the discussion about the currency Scotland will have has been neutralized more or less.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and defense of state health that citizens have for free.
Darling supported London’s bankers in the currency matter, and he also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatisation of health.
The way Salmond said it, he went to bed with conservatives.
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish electorate knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to voters in Scotland, but to the "boss" association, to the Confederate British Industry.
It is beginning to be clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Union's campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly graduate home.
Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron was able to say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's causing almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots are not to jump out and they must accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pesimistic beginning of school according to Miloš Urbana
Illustration to story of the longest year
Miloš Urban The longest year
The end of the holiday was the best, the last week that went nowhere, and we were just hanging around and hanging out with the girls, quiet from the storm, quiet from the stress.
New clothes, when you could get from Tuzex, shoes from Eastern Germany.
Reading the Quick arrows, already fallen, hurling on a bicycle mountain around Imperial to the back of Vara, somewhere to the tennis courts, was no longer hot, the sun smoothed its back and shoulders, knocked the beams on a farewell.
In the evening, mild nervousness, still a holiday regime, sleep up to half eleven o'clock, it'll be worse for a week, the moments before the fall asleep will stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then wake up at half seven o'clock in the morning.
It'll be Monday.
Most of the time it doesn't rain, on the other hand, summer is being misguided in front of school.
It's like a plastic figure in a glass life, there's the school, the D.A.
Zapotok with a wildly pink ring, and before it old-known faces and a few new, boys more stretchy, girls boobier.
There are rascals out there, to avoid them, as interesting as they are infalliblely holding together and how soon they are here.
And these grown-up looking girls who came out screaming, now they're laughing hysterically, probably in their lives over the holiday, while everything's changed at my place at the old age.
And new first-timers, some nervous and others excited, why are they coming here anyway?
Because he has to, he has to have a military duty.
So inside, cold humidity of the floor and light smell of disinfectant, poisoned with a moped, unfortunately, still the same thing as he said he'd borrow the key from the metal box, where we can leave the textbooks and which are still so little.
For a bottle.
Smrad wardrobe remains in memory, now does not act, is well done, but in a week it will be worse.
It's just from the idea that your stomach is closing and your head's starting to hurt.
The head, which is even worse than the work of mathematics, the evil play for the chosen, among which I don't belong, and never will.
Again, those threes and fours, don't take fives, hide from the test, blend in the bench, and best of all, be there and not be there, exist only as a name in the classroom, and yet dream stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas in space, where no one complains, does no one depress anyone, and does not hit anyone's foot.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only day before, now like years ago.
She let her birth daughter die.
She's threatened by an extraordinary sentence - News.cz
The first delivery took place in March 2012 in the booth of public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without foreign aid, she was born a girl who, after cutting down her pet, packed in a ready blanket, hid under a bonco and took her to a road passenger, where she put her into bushes located several dozen meters away from the road.
She was born on her way to school.
It seemed a little early for me.
I was on my way to school.
I had to go to the bathroom on the bus, I had to give birth there.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with scissors I wore at school," said the defendant and said she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"On the following day, the body of the child returned to the place, put into the backpack and took the body out of the bag, packed in the black plastic bag and hid and left under the stairway of her grandmother's house in Havlíčkova Broda," he says, "the prosecution is not clear when the infant's death occurred.
It could have been ten minutes, but also hours after birth, suffocation in the blanket, or putting under the jacket, by foot, or by bleeding from the unscathed umbilical.
The similar scenario happened next year in spring.
A woman at a later stage from February to April 12, when a child's corpse was found with random witnesses under a bushing at a pond in Havličkabrodsk, she herself secretly gave birth.
This time in the bathroom of a sub level apartment in the family house.
Without verifying whether it was born alive, without cutting or holding a petal, who was wrapped around the neck, put the baby in several plastic containers, including plastic bags and left it in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his partner took him to the pond together.
Eventually she was dropped by a friend.
The father of both children was just an accused friend, who allegedly didn't know about the pregnancy of his partner.
For this reason, it is not now worth trial, but has only been punished for a sin against the law on burial.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like not being punished as an accessory.
He manipulated my child against my wish.
I know my solution was wrong, but it came to me as a human being at that moment," she did not hide the indignation of the defendant, who allegedly, in a relationship, was subject to and feared by the man.
During her statement, a young woman spoke fairly well.
The tears in her eyes brought her up to the moment when she spoke of a relationship with her parents, from which she left herself when she became active.
She said she didn't want to kill.
"He rides behind me every 14 days for a visit, do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she cried.
I didn't do my equipment because I didn't want kids to, I felt young.
I tried to put him in a babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do that.
I cannot explain that to you," the judge answered the question.
She refused, however, that she would act with reason and intent to kill the newborn.
Moreover, the second child was born dead, according to her statement.
But she never stopped drinking alcohol.
I have, however, limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I also reduced smoking," she said.
Although pregnancy was both seen in both cases, even repeated questions claimed that it was inconvenient.
And that's my friend.
The main exam will continue with the Castle Court on Tuesday with statements of judicial experts.
A judgment could already be made on Wednesday.
A woman is threatened with a penalty rate of up to 18 years in prison, or even an exceptional penalty.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching three-milliard redemption of Prestige Cruise
According to sources associated with the whole matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the third largest ship cruise operator in the world has advanced in the negotiations for Prestige Cruises International Inc. for about three billion dollars.

The agreement can be published this week, revealed on Sunday's source, but pointed out that the negotiations still do not have to end successfully.
Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 % stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not wish to be appointed because the negotiations were not public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not reply to the comment, spokesperson Apollo refused to comment on the situation.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates thirteen cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, Central America and Caribbean.
The company's income in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the signs Oceania and Regent, which together owns eight cruise ships flying to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company announced a sales of 1.2 billion dollars, 6% more than in the previous year.
Nine-fifty billion-dollar segment of cruise voyages is expected to benefit from the rise of middle class in emerging economies like China and India in the coming year.
Companies compete to become the preferred option for these customers when selecting cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public offer in January 2014.
Apollo has a majority share in the company since 2007 since the trade closure of $850 million.

Prodemocratic activists in Hong Kong, following a vote decision, provoke the Chinese authorities
Near there was a group of people loyal to Beijing who had a Chinese flag.
The Standing Commission of the National People's Congress on Sunday agreed that only two of the three candidates participate in Hong Kong in the 2017 elections.
All candidates must first receive support from the appointment committee, which is likely to be composed of loyal Beijing members.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition democrats to get to elections and bring pro-democratic activists to restore promise and to cripple the financial center of Hong Kong's protests of the 'Stand' movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tension, the Chinese leaders are afraid that the demand for democratisation will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report in June drawing up Chinese official powers in Hong Kong, democratic activists organised an unofficial referendum on elections in the special official district and hundreds of thousands of people entered the city’s business district and occupied it.
The press conference, which will be held by Prime Minister Li, is organised by the Government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Interinstitutional Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, several press conferences were also asked by Vice-President of the Standing Committee on Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei.
The student activists said he would gather himself in front of Hong Kong Government's office this afternoon.
Within the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open negotiations with the Eastern Ukraine on “state sovereignty”
According to a description of the events of the Russian newspaper, on Sunday, President Vladimir Putin asked the Russian Government to stop fighting with separatists in the east and to immediately open negotiations on the “state sovereignty” of the area torn off.
His spokesperson Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin had no intention to indicate that the Eastern Ukraine regions under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated so that the Russian speaking region would have the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's challenge to the Kiev Government to act with the prorian rebels as equals, is consistent with a clear strategy which follows from the outbreak of riots five months ago: Help the Separatists to occupy the territory and make the Ukrainian government grant the newly announced Novorus the real independence, so that instead of the West, it can connect with Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of State Television Putin sentenced Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern region of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were controlled by Separatists in March and April after Moscow was adopted on 18 March by the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine.
The Kremlin and Separatists recently occupied the territory referred to as “New Zealand” or “New Russia”, a term referring to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words, according to which “the prison of illusions” is everyone who believes that peace talks are on the horizon, because Ukrainian politicians started parliamentary elections on October 26, while government units attack civilians in areas controlled by separatists.
"In the interest of people living in these areas, we must immediately initiate meaningful negotiations not only on legal matters but also on the political organisation of society and the state sovereignty of the South-East of Ukraine," he said.
Pestkov said that Putin's assault on state sovereignty was thought in the context of the wider autonomy that he has been dealing with Kiev's leadership for several months and which is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian speaking areas from the threat of cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov stated that the necessary autonomy could only be granted to the eastern region by the Ukrainian government.
It is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The action of spokesperson Kremlin, who was to correct the "incordual interpretation" of Putin's remarks, highlighted Russia's approach to solving the rebellion of separatists in the East, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two million populations are originating in ethnic Russians.
Moscow should have a much greater difficulty in taking Down and Luhansk to the east of Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians and polls of public opinion that have taken place before the conflict have shown broad support for the continuation of Ukraine.
The autonomy that the Russian diplomats have acted on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and essentially give Kremla effective control of the territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula enacted five months ago is the seat of the main Russian fleet, the maritime trade background and the historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also central to the mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Porošenko, during his inaugural speech of 7 June, suggested that Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, consider changes in the constitution that would give the various regions more control over their finances and language status.
This vision of autonomy differs considerably from the vision of Kremlin and separatists. Moscow is accused of disarming and stimulating violence.
Putin's last challenge to act as separatists as equals followed the further procedure of the insurgents last week after Russian troops and tanks from earlier peaceful areas along the Azov Sea penetrated the eastern Ukraine.
Russian Separatists have taken over control of Novoazovsk with such a force that Ukrainian security authorities are worried that it is a campaign to occupy strategic coastal territory up to Crimea.
This has speeded up a huge civilian and military effort to opinate Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500 000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsko and a narrow entrance gate on the Crimean peninsula.
Porošenko, on Saturday, stepped up to meeting the leaders of the European Union in Brussels and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We approach the point from which there is no return," Porosenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located in Ukraine.
The EU Summit has not taken any definitive action - leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecific escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday, told the reporters in Kiev that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilojsk after two colonies of Russian armored vehicles last week and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk area to support dressed separatists.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilojsk during the Russian invasion were replaced in 10 Russian supporters captured a week ago in Ukraine on Sunday Lysenko.
The Australian celebrities and Gabi Greko are also involved in the scandal with exposed photos.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his neglect over hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Greko and other powerful Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after the biggest scandal with hacked photos of celebrity got on the Internet series of explicit photos naked Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker claims to have 60 photos of naked Star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars, including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, Rihanny, Ariany Grande and Ley Michella, and Kirsten Dunst's actress.
As a result of the escape from iCloud, personal images of the Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Greco also came to the public.
There's 101 celebrity on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greece to marry last month, the Confidial magazine said: “It's disgusting.
All private correspondence and all private pictures should remain private.
It's shameful that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Greek, now in New York, according to the online news reports, the hacking is “impulsive” and those who became his target “becoming humiliation.”
It's believed that the hacker won 30 pictures of Palmer with his former friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures on top of him at the pool.
Palmer acted, for example, in the film Love and honor, where she was her counterpart, Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the Chuck Strahovski television series and actress from the thriller Sucker Punk Browning last night did not comment on stolen images.
Deputy Lawrence TTMZ said: “I'm going for a clear violation of privacy.”
Herec Seth Rogen hacker criticized on his twitter: “Following photos of hacked phones is the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the disclosure of stolen images should not tolerate.
The Sigma footballers have made good, even without winning
Olomouc - Thunders and lightnings, which the co-owner of the Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinated last week, are, seems, the past.
After all, being from Opava only brought a point of defense.
After all, they made up their club bosses a little bit.
The payback money might come to the club soon.
"I don't have one more game, as I talked about last week, but I am much more optimistic," Lébr confirmed that despite the fact that Sigma didn't win, his players convinced him with improved performance.
Battle and deployment, with which we played mainly in the second half, was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In such a case, I am able to forgive that it is not going to happen.
If we'd played this way since the beginning of the season, I'm convinced we haven't lost," Lébra thinks.
Sigma in Opava exceeded the initial domestic pressure, then the game was balanced, and in the second half it was better.
After the victory of Kalod, they were reaching out, but they did not reach the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not according to our imagination.
To our satisfaction we have missed only one change of chances," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the approach of football players caused only a threat.
There were certainly more aspects.
Whether on my side, on the side of a coach or a fan," Lébra said.
With pressure, Sigma has to count
Players after the game in the Opava event last week did not want to comment much.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried not to let it go," said the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl.
Without comment, then left the question of Lébro's statement last week, the attacker Václav Vysicek, who had not turned Sigma's biggest opportunity into a Saturday's match.
But he's only listening a little bit to the pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
They're all trying to get on us.
Today we have shown that if we fight and ride all the way up our ass, it will go," he said.
They took warning to heart
Not even coach Leoš Kalvoda pretended that the preparation for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere which reigned in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that Mr. Lebra's warning was taken to heart.
Although it was not even before that they would not want to fight, and they changed their minds," he said.
It was similar to the first 15 minutes.
It took us long to compare ourselves to hardness and realize what the other league is about.
It's not just about football, it's about fighting," Kalvoda said.
There's nothing left to hope for Sigma to work from the beginning in the next games.
"I would love to believe it very much," he added.
